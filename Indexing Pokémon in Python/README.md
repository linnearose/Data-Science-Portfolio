## Business Case

You are an analyst at a "scrappy" online gaming company that specializes in remakes of last year's fads.

Your boss, who runs the product development team, is convinced that Pokemon Go's fatal flaw was that you had to actually move around outside. She has design mock-ups for a new game called Pokemon Stay: in this version players still need to move, but just from website to website. Pokemon gyms are now popular online destinations, and catching Pokemon in the "wild" simply requires browsing the internet for hours in the comfort of your home.

She wants you to program a prototype version of the game.

## Directions

Follow the question prompts and use base Python to create data stuctures and functions for the "Pokemon Stay" game.

We will be looking for the following things:

- For coding questions, Python code that gives the correct output for each question
- For written questions, clear answers in Markdown cells
