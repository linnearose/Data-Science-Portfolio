In the spirit of the season, we want to celebrate with our Reddit family! ☃️

One random kitty will receive a special package filled with Stormy, Bob and Potato’s favorite treats and toys!  🎁  

#[The adorable sponsors](https://imgur.com/a/P16erSL)

They have paw-selected a variety of items from an online retailer and have filled my cart with a lot of fun toys and tasty treats!      
(Can be modified before mailing if any of your little ones have dietary or physical restrictions) 

#**Please read the Q&amp;A below!**

Just comment below and tell us how you make the holidays special for your pets or show us with a picture! 🐈

It will be totally random!    
I will write out entrant’s usernames on  pieces of paper, ball them up and let the cats decide! 😻

##**When will I receive my presents?** 
After the deadline, I will contact the winner via PM and ask for a physical shipping address (Contiguous United States only) and if their cat has any dietary or physical restrictions. I’ll adjust the order accordingly if needed and have it shipped directly to you!  
Shipping usually takes 2 business days.  
(May vary due to the busy season)

346,Some questions from a hopefully soon to be cat owner!,cats,t3_aaf6qm,8,False,False,aaf6qm,"Hello Reddit!

Firstly, sorry if this is the wrong place to post or these questions have been answered before. I did have a long look through post history but mostly I just saw pictures of all your awesome cats. Also sorry if this gets a bit long. My partner and I are looking to adopt a cat in the near future and I'm doing everything I can to find out as much as possible before we make any decisions.

So, a bit about me.. I admit I've always been a bit more of a dog person. I absolutely love all animals and when at friends who have cats I pay more attention to them than people but my partner is very much a cat person and I know we'll both be very happy with a new feline friend in our lives! I last had cats as a small child but of course my parents did all the hard work then, so this will be very new to me. Throughout the rest of my childhood and a good chunk of my adult life I've had dogs and most recently as we moved in together and were originally in a smaller flat we had pet rats together who we absolutely adored.

What I'm looking for mostly is advice on what type of cat would be best for us, as I'll admit I don't have a lot of knowledge on breeds beyond articles I've been reading. Though any other advice, tips or general help people can offer is of course welcome.

I know some people like cats who are very self sufficient and keep to themselves, but I'm a needy human when it comes to pets and I want a cat breed who is much more likely to bond closely with humans and also needs that attention and a lot of cuddles! My favourite part of being a dog owner was always coming home to those silly buggers jumping all over me and showing nothing but excitement to see their humans return. I know cats are different but I've seen family members with cats in the past who barely care if they are in the house or gone because they just do their own thing and while I know we'll love our cats no matter what I'd hope to go for a breed that will be more friendly and willing to bond with us. 

We both work full time but with the hours we work our new friends wouldn't be alone for more than 3-4 hours a day the majority of days. I'd be more than open to adopting two cats so they always have company as I hate the idea of an animal being left completely alone for any length of time. From what I'm reading I think we would prefer to have indoor cats however I'm always interested in hearing anyone's opinion on this. Again I'd feel bad to get a cat who desires freedom and keep it in all the time but it will have the freedom of a house and I will spend whatever it takes to make sure they have all the toys and luxuries cats can have plus nothing but attention when we are home. 

While it seems ""easier"" to decide on a breed and just find a breeder and spend a lot of money getting exactly what we want, I've always loved the idea of rescuing cats from a shelter and giving them another chance at a great life. We recently visited a cat sanctuary in Rome and I absolutely fell in love with an old disabled cat there who just didn't want to leave my lap. Had it have been at all feasible he'd have come straight home with me that day! On both fronts though I'd like to know from you guys what questions we should ask a breeder or a shelter about a cats history, what things to look our for and what red flags we should be weary off with a cats temperament or health. We know this could be the next 20 years of our lives and we're both super excited about it but I want to take my time, ask the right questions, do all the preparation possible and go into this with our eyes open and hopefully end up giving our new family members the best possible life. 

Thanks! "

Last Friday, she 1) didn't show up at my bedroom door for breakfast at 5:30am, 2) slept *all afternoon*, and 3) blew off dinner.    Not typical.  Fortunately, she had a routine annual vet visit scheduled on Saturday.   I talked to the vet about her listlessness and lack of appetite, speculating that maybe she was incubating a UTI.  Doc took blood samples to screen for thyroid/kidney function/diabetes etc, and I brought a clean urine spec from home (couldn't get one in office).   They also gave her subcutaneous fluids as a precaution.

Got results from blood and urine on Monday - everything was fine in the blood, but she did have bacteria and blood in her urine; UTI confirmed!   She's on clavamox now and already feeling much better.

TL;DR - you know your cat's personality and habits best.  Pay attention when they're not ""themselves"", you can save them a lot of discomfort."

412,Need help with 2 month old stray kitten,cats,t3_aadlsz,1,False,False,aadlsz,"During my and my brother's break at my parents' home, my father found a little female black kitten hiding under his ATV yesterday. My parents just moved into a chicken farm, and apparently it is pretty common for people to throw out cats at farms because they think farm owners will take care of them.  Anyways, because we had no cat food present and couldn't drive to a local store, I gave her some cooked beef meat, cooked white egg, and a bowl of water. There is no way my parents can take care of her and their dog in the house would literally try to kill the kitten if she ever sees the cat on one of her walks (and truthfully, my parents are not the best pet owners). So right now, she's hiding in between little creaks on my parents' back porch. My brother and I are driving home tomorrow (will be a three hour drive) and are planning to bring her to some sort of shelter along the way. As cute as she is, we cannot take care of her (we are busy college students). The kitten looks fine and uninjured, so I don't think it is necessary to bring her to a vet (and we need to save money).

My question is where should we bring her?  
I read that they are a no kill animal shelter, but I read oftentimes stray kittens should not be brought to an animal shelter because they will euthanize them.
Or should we bring her to my local humane society? Truth be told, I am still not sure what a animal humane society really is.

I just want to make sure the poor kitten gets to find proper owners. "
413,Advice request: young (5yr. +/-) cat with chronic diarrhea - no luck thus far with veterinary tests/treatments,cats,t3_aagqis,5,False,False,aagqis,"Hi all - thanks in advance for reading

My wife and I have a female domestic (US) shorthair (aprox. 5 years old) with a chronic diarrhea issue. She has had persistent diarrhea for a little over 3 months despite our vet recommended treatments. She has NO obvious behavioral issues associated.. 

We have done the following:

2 fecal parasite tests

A full bloodwork (liver health/nutrient absorption) test

2.5-3 weeks on an anti inflammatory/antibiotic medication 

Steroid shot 

2+ months on Z/D food with absolutely no treats/other food 

An ultrasound that showed us nothing abnormal 

We live in a fairly stress free home. We haven’t moved in nearly 4 years and have no children/excessive company. Our other cat (a 12ish yo male) is an asshole but healthy and does not have the same diarrhea problems. 

Frankly, I’m grasping at straws with this post. The next step that our vet recommended is a biopsy. We just really want to get to the bottom of this in a way that causes minimal stress/discomfort to our cat. 

Any anecdotes/advice is truly appreciated.

I have never had to do this myself before and I am terrified. My parents have had to put our previous dogs to sleep in the past but I was never able to be there personally.

[Jupiter](http://imgur.com/a/cyGoOec) was diagnosed with lymphoma in early October but given his age the vet suggested instead of putting him through cancer staging and chemotherapy that we should just treat him with prednisone to help with the swollen lymph nodes in his neck and try to keep him comfortable since he'd probably only have 6-8 weeks left in him tops. It has been 3 months now.

At first the prednisone seemed to help and they shrunk in size for a few weeks, but his marble sized nodes soon became the size of half-golf balls and the original two lumps have increased to several beneath his jaw, behind his ears and along his collar bones. Although he used to clean his food and water bowl each day now he'll barely sniff the food before only taking a few bites and a few laps of water before returning to his heated bed to stare off into nowhere. 

I think the hardest part of doing this is that he still meows to me like the chatty cat he has always been, and still comes to my side for cuddles whenever I sit/lay back to watch Netflix or draw in my coloring books. He's still the same old kitty that gives me a half purr/half meow as he readjusts mid nap to stretch before curling into a ball and nuzzling his face up against my lap....but lately when he's not by my side he's meowing every couple seconds like he's lost as he paces the room, occasionally losing balance, and his meows have now grown raspy. To make matters worse his compromised immune system has allowed him to fall victim to an upper respiratory infection that antibiotics aren't helping.

I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I know he isn't going to get any better...but I am struggling with the all too common thought of ""what if its too soon, and he has a few more weeks in him?""  But then I feel like I'm being selfish and question if I'm just trying to keep him around for my sake after raising him these last 16 years. I don't want to play God and be the one who chooses when he has to die, but I really just don't want him to suffer any more than he has.

So I guess this post is partly me venting and partly me looking for any kind of support that I can. I've stayed up with him for the last three nights mostly crying as I brush him and give him his favorite treats. I don't know how I'm going to adjust to him being gone. My heart already aches.

So guys, is there anything I can do to make this process easier? How does one really cope with losing their fur-child? Really wish my mom was here to help me go through with this.


Edit: The appointment is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, so tonight will consist of all the cuddles, brushes, and treats kitty's heart desires.

Thank you to those who have commented their support.  I really do appreciate that I'm not completely alone here. Already feeling kind of numb right now,but I hope that time makes it easier and that he looks down to me from the other side, knowing Ive only done what I thought was best for him."

473,Biting Cat Problem,cats,t3_aaexxj,2,False,False,aaexxj,"Hi everyone. This is an advice post. I hope that is okay here.

Background: So, I just recently adopted a new cat. He has been in my place for over a month now. Haven't had a cat for many years (not since my previous cat died), but I love cats and felt it was time for a new friend. My current place has never had a cat in it before. I have already had him to the vet for his shots, blood and stool tests, and all the rest. He is 1 year old and in perfect health. He has cat toys and a scratching post, a good litter setup, good food, a water source, and all that basic stuff. He is a very affectionate cat, loves attention, and I haven't had any problems with him until 5 days ago.

The problem: He has started biting, randomly. It seemed to come out of nowhere. He will do it at random times. I may be petting him and he is perfectly happy and content. Then all of a sudden, he bites. I might be walking, he runs up to my legs, then bites a leg, an ankle, or a foot. I am emptying the dryer and he climbs up on me (which he has always done before without problem) but this time he bites my neck or my shoulder or my chest. 

If this was just a few times, I wouldn't care. But it has been a sudden onset of multiple times a day. If it was play bites, I wouldn't care. My old cat used to do that. But he is biting very hard. It is hard enough to draw blood every time and obviously it hurts. And he doesn't always stop at one bite but often continues in an aggressive manner.

So, when he isn't being a little shit, he is great. I like him. I don't want to get rid of him if i don't have to. But if this can't be stopped, I'm not going to put up with it. I will have to put him up for adoption.

Just an additional note: I thought that maybe he felt he wasn't getting enough attention. I am very busy with work most of the time. So I tried paying special attention to him after the problem started and making sure he got affection from me. It did not help at all. In fact, he seems to have gotten worse.

Advice welcome. Any approaches to dealing with biters or discouraging such behavior? Thank you.

So I have this cat. She is a wonderful cat. Good with my 6 year old. She never bites or scratches unless entirely on accident. She does not rip up the couches or the carpet. She's a big old snuggly lap kitty who is usually pretty quiet and mellow. My wife, my 6 year old, and I got her when she was about 3 months old, from a shelter. For the first 8 months to a year she was fine. Until my problem came about. Forgive the longer details:

Our cat has Pica and it's going to kill her in the next few months, I just know it. First it started with small chords and wires. We'd find them nibbled on or through. Then she started eating socks, clothes, shoe-strings. And she doesn't just chew on them and spit them out. She swallows everything. Eat a red shoe lace? Find it in her litter box. Eat a black sock? Vomitted up all over the carpet the next morning. The problem is, this only happens when we are either asleep or not home. We have never caught her chewing or eating something during the day. Leave the house? Come home to an eaten chord.

So far she's eaten: 15 shirts, 3 expensive dresses, countless socks and underwear/panties, shoe strings, small chords, basically any toy becomes a meal, and now she's started eating plastic bags. But that is after all this time so far.

We originally noticed her eating chords and immediately took her to the vet, but nothing has helped, and she's only eaten more stuff and grown her pallet to other types of items.

The vet suggested we start keeping all of our stuff out of reach of the cat. We live in a 1,000 SQFT apartment. There isn't a lot of room, but we began locking her out of the bedrooms and hiding all the clothes and shoes in the bedroom. We got a special door hanger for shoes so they wont be in the entry way. All of our clothes bins and everything else are in the bedrooms. We've meticulously trained our 6 year old to put her socks in the clothes hamper and not leave them on the floor. No matter how much we try this she manages to find something to eat. At minimum once a week there is something. Whether it's food from a trash can (we got lids and locks for out trash cans) or a sock she managed to steal and hide somewhere, or a chord that she found interesting. She is NEVER allowed in the bedrooms anymore, but she is smart and somehow finds ways to grab something without us seeing or eats something that she normally doesn't have an interest in

The vet suggested we change her diet. Add more wet food, leave dry food out for her to graze on. We leave out dry food? She eats it all and will beg for more. She started gaining a lot of weight so our vet suggested we go back to meal times because she was just chowing down on the available dry food.

The vet suggested we improve her environment for enrichment. I bought her a massive cat tree to replace her smaller old one, an expensive large adventureland for her to play in. We bought her toys to play with, laser pointer to chase after, a bunch of chew toys, those cardboard cat scratch things. We bought her two toys that are puzzle feeders, and we changed her feeding bowl to a food tower that she needs to retrieve the food from. We bought a flowing flower petal water feeder so she can lick the stream rather than drink straight from a bowl. We bought cat grass for her to nibble on and got toys with catnip inside. Within a few days she had swallowed most the contents of the toys we bought her and her behavior didn't change at all.

We took her back to the vet. They suggested a special type of smell aerosol thing that calms cats, along with some prescription cat dry food that is meant to be ""calming"". It cost about double the price of the cat food we were buying. Since our cat was only eating stuff when we were asleep or not in the house, and was a loveable lap kitty when we are around, our Vet suggested our cat might have separation anxiety when we are gone and that calming cat stuff might help. So fine, we buy the small aerosol thing and the prescription cat food. Still absolutely no noticeable change in her behavior. She clearly seems more mellowed out by the food after she eats, but that has not stopped her from chewing through stuff.

The vet suggested we try leaving out socks or other items for her with special bad taste solution on it to deter the cat from eating stuff, essentially training her to take a bite of something she normally would chew on, and realize it tastes bad. Again, I've mentioned our cat is smart. I left out half a dozen socks over a period of time with various flavors on them that would taste bad to a cat. She just simply ignored them and still continues to eat stuff.

I've tried taking anything that was eaten and showing it to my cat and saying ""No! Bad kitty!"" and shaming her for eating whatever she ate. Doesn't seem to make a fucking bit of difference.

Our cat gets regular blood work, fecal and deworming. She has regular teeth cleanings and vet check-ups. We've never missed a dental cleaning and her teeth look great, our Vet thought maybe she might have gum inflamation she's trying to treat by eating soft stuff, but she gets regular dental cleanings and has no inflamation and the vet agreed that's probably not the problem.

Our vet decided to do some blood work and other investigations on her stomach. No result came back that would indicate a reason for her PICA. Up until now she's always managed to either vomit or pass whatever she ate, no matter what it was.

Christmas day she ate half a plastic bag and ended up in the kitty hospital. She wasn't moving. Wasn't eating, wasn't drinking, wasn't pooping or peeing. She was hiding in a weird place she never hides and was extremely lethargic. We thought she would die right then and there. We woke up at 5am the day after Christmas to find a huge plastic bag practically half eaten and she looked like death. So I rushed her into the kitty hospital right away because we knew something was wrong. Two X-Rays, a Radiologist consult determined that although she clearly had something abnormal in her, there wasn't a full obstruction and she could pass it on her own with fluids. But she wasn't eating or drinking on her own even with coaxing. The Vet administered drugs and IV fluids. They sent us home with her that night and wanted to see her the next morning. The next day they gave her more fluids and said if she doesn't have a bowel movement to bring her back.

Last night she had a bowel movement (thank god) and despite the fact she had a CONE OF SHAME on, she managed to find a piece of cloth she pulled out of a linen closet and eat most of it. I know it was last night because it was still freshly wet with her saliva when I woke up today. She has been home from the hospital for less than 24 hours and she already found something else to eat.

I spent $1100 on X-Rays, and fucking IV fluids for a cat that immediately is trying to put itself back in the hospital not one fucking day before we get back home. I looked her right in the face and asked her if she genuinely wanted to die? She just stared at me blankly.

Our Vet suggested we start buying Prozac for our cat and take her to a behavioral specialist. I asked if the specialist would take her in for a few weeks and train her not to eat stuff. She said they wouldn't, they'd just suggest solutions that we would do at home. I ask you, honestly, what other solution is there? I feel like we've done quite literally everything there is to do. Diet, enrichment, environmental changes, medicated food, etc.

What is a specialist going to tell us to do that the Vet has not? Lock her in the bathroom when we go to work or leave the house or go to bed? Put a fucking muzzle on her? Lock her in her cat carrier and let her piss and poop in the thing every night because she can't be trusted to be left alone for her own safety?

I've spent a bunch of money on special food, toys, other enrichment things, and now after Christmas when I am broke as fuck I just dropped a fucking GRAND to have her saved and she is committing the same behavior within a single day of coming home. My wife and I spent almost an hour last night cleaning up anything we could think of, and she managed to find something else.

Prozac and a behavioral specialist are only going to cost more money, and my Vet herself seemed to think prozac was a long shot. My cat is two fucking years old. And has only been doing this for a yearish.

I have honest to god been so diligent about picking up stuff before we leave the house or go to bed. Our cat manages to find something to chew on that isn't food anyways. My wife and I both work full time jobs and have a kid. We cannot watch our cat every fucking waking hour of the day. But we love our kitty, despite the fact she's ruined hundreds of dollars worth of nice clothing and other items. Our six year old loves our kitty and would be devastated if she died.

But if our cat wakes up tomorrow having eaten something else and is sick I can't honestly justify dropping another thousand dollars to save her life. I am not a bad person. I've had two dogs and three cats and every single one died of old age. I don't want our kitty to die, we took her in and promised to take care of her. But I don't know how to save her from herself and I am at my wits end.

What do I do?

Every window blind in the house is shredded, he claws the couches and chews up books and furniture. He bites and scratches constantly and will go out of his way to literally terrorize you if you lay down on the couch; going as far as launching himself across the room to dig his teeth and claws into your arms. If you tell him no or try to discipline him he comes back 10x harder like he's pissed that he's being told no. I've tried getting a calming collar, room spray that deters the aggressive behavior, toys to entertain him, yelling and firmly saying ""no"", or pinning him down and trying to get him to calm down. **Nothing** works and I'm at a loss for what to do. 

There are times where I feel he is bipolar (if that's even possible for cats) because he will be as sweet as can be when he first wakes up, and will stretch up to be picked up by his dad and he'll let him hold him for a while. But then, it's like he realizes ""Oh, it's 8 o'clock, I have to be a jerk now."" and is awful for the rest of the day. He has also been urinating everywhere as of the padt few weeks; and that behavior ia getting worse amd worse. Not spraying, he squats down and pees everywhere. There is nothing wrong with his litterbox-we keep it clean.

He hasn't been fixed yet, and we plan on going to do that as soon as we can get a little more money to do so. A lot of advice I've seen is that fixing them can help tremendously; but what if it doesn't? What steps do I take next after the visit to the vet doesn't help with his aggression?"

Today we introduced her to the family dogs and it’s been...a process. First we let them meet trough a glass door and then we put the cat (Zelda is her name) on the table and let the dogs in one by one.

So far the dogs have been very nice and don’t bark at her but she still hisses at them and looks very scared. I know it’s only been a day but we’re kinda winging it and we need some help.

TL;DR: New cat hasn’t got used to the family dogs. Need advice on how to make this transition run more smoothly.

Penny is having trouble using the litter box. We have had her since she was a kitten and up until she was 6mo she had no issues using a litter box. She suddenly stopped using it, she started by just pooping and peeing in front of it. Now its about the same, but instead of pooping in front of the box she will find a corner to poop in. At first it was just any corner, we recently moved and now there are 3 distinct places other than the box that she uses as a potty spot. 2 she pees at, and 1 she poops at. Her usual daily hang is in our bedroom, she sleeps in the bed, on our window sill or under the bed. Doesn't typically leave except for potty and food. The only exception to her potty spots is if we leave clothing on the floor in our bedroom, she uses that to pee on instead. No poops in the bedroom though. 
She pees in front of the litter box, and in front of our spare room door. She poops in our bathroom behind our toilet, however if we close our bathroom door, I assume she poops in the box because we have yet to find any other pooping spots. 

She is very timid and a very shy cat. She isn't very assertive with people but she is occasionally aggressive with our other 2 for babies. The other cats will fight back and scare her off. I'm not sure if she just wants to play or if she is actually being aggressive. 
We love her so much. We are very stressed though. 
She uses the box sometimes, it should be noted. 
Any advice would be helpful. We are taking her to the vet in the next couple weeks, money is tight right now."

516,Adopting an adult cat into a small apartment,cats,t3_aabpz2,6,False,False,aabpz2,"Hi everyone! We’re bringing a cat into our home today! She’s a 7 year old kitten named Maggie. I always had a cat during the 17 years I lived at home, and my parents still have the cat I rescued when I was 14 (they live on a farm so she’s an indoor/outdoor cat, and I live in the city so I couldn’t take her). However, it’s been 6 years since I’ve owned my own cat. 

Some background on this cat in particular- I haven’t met her yet, but my roommate has and says she’s “super sweet and cuddly”. Apparently she was given up by her previous owners because she “didn’t get along” with the other cats in her home. We were going to wait until february to get a cat, since we’re moving to a bigger place, but my roommate fell in love with this one. She’s spayed and already declawed (I’d never do it myself but it is convenient when you live in apartments) so our landlord made an exception for us, since we have a little more than a month left on our lease. 

Does anyone have any tips on introducing her to our new place? She’s in a “foster” home now, so she’s not coming from a shelter. We have a tiny 740sq foot apartment, and there’s three of us here. There’s no room that’s empty for her to “hide” while she gets comfortable. I’m also struggling to figure out the best place for a litter box. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/TQ9P3pO) is the floor plan to our apartment. 

Any tips would be lovely if you have experience in a crowded/small apartment and a new cat. We’re moving in a month + a week which is gonna be another issue but the layout will be much better for her there and there’s a perfect space for a litter box so the space issue is only temporary. "

I live in the middle of nowhere and the only brand I'd be willing to be that's within half an hour of me is Taste of the Wild. I heard picky cats like that? Is there a chance she would eat that if I go out and pick some up? "

552,Agressive behaviour,cats,t3_aa9y6b,6,False,False,aa9y6b,"Hi!

I’m posting this with the hope of getting some advice from you guys about my cat’s behaviour. 

First, she is not my 1st cat. Growing up I had many precious cats, whom, sadly, had tragic ends due to the fact my family, at that time, didn’t believed cats would be happy “trapped inside of a house”. With those horrible memories that lead me to believe I was cursed and could not have cats, I have been EXTREMELY terrified of something happening with my current precious fur baby. I found her when she was \~3 months old, she was on a construction site right next to my house (reason she’s a scaredy cat) . It was around 10pm when I heard her cry &amp; told my bf to check it up for me as he was going home. At 1st he thought it could be a neighbour's cat, but as he approached the site the noise became louder. He pointed his phone flashlight and there she was. So, I left my house yard, and went to the middle of the street, crouched &amp; started meowing, she was extremely afraid but curious and hopeful, so I was able to pick her up, and immediately took her inside.

She was a sweet kitten, purring every time &amp; sleeping every night with me, my sunshine. I took her to the vet, played with her, slept with her, never hitting her when she mis-behaved but making sure she knew I was mad (literally patted her side butty while talking with a angry voice, she always made an “offended” face when I did so, so I believe she understood).

But her behaviour has been changing (2 yrs old in February 2019), which is normal, but lately she became aggressive with me…and yes, pretty much just with me…when I say this, is because she literally just starts clawing and biting me out of nowhere, she buries her nails into my leg while biting, when I'm finally able to take her out of my leg she immediately strikes again, sometimes meowing before...I thought maybe it happens when I’m not giving her much attention because I spend much time outside, but even when I spent the entire day with her, she still does it…The other night I spent some amazing 20\~30 minutes with her half sleeping on my lap, purring as I patted her where and how she loves, 10 minutes after that, she was attacking me ...

I'm basically the only one who really takes care of her. The only one (in a house of 5) that feeds her, takes her to the vet &amp; cleans her box, the one who sleeps with her, the one with the room 24hrs open to her, if I'm home, she's with me, everyone else only pets her from time to time, still, I'm the one she attacks. It hurts me physically and emotionally, because I worry she might not be okay or that maybe she just doesn't likes me that much or even hates me sometimes...

What should I do? Did this happened to any of you? I don't even mind if she scratchs me while we are playing, because I know it wasn't on purpose, it was an accident, another thing is literally attacking...when she does it I lock her in the bathroom right next to my room, as I'm entering my room I open the bathroom door and close my room's one, preventing her from entering my room and letting her with access to her food, bed, box, toys, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the huge post...I really wanted to give all the info I could so you could all understand a bit better the situation, thanks in advance. "

[Prim feels betraaaaayed!](https://i.redd.it/1nhb2j8xdx621.jpg)

My cats, Prim and Clara, are currently on a prescription diet because of suspected IBS. They were on this diet before we found out Clara has clostridium and are now forced to medicate them twice a day. We still have plenty of cans of their old food left over that are untouched, but we cannot feed them this as we are trialing the food exclusively.

The medication comes as a powder that we should mix with their wet food. They could tell that there was meds in the first meal we tried this with and left their wet food untouched overnight (an unheard of phenomenon in our household). Because of this we now inject the meds mixed with a cat treat called “tuna mousse” into their faces twice a day. This works quite well. Today, I accidentally left the last (already opened) sleeve of tuna mousse out on the counter. Not trusting the contents that had now been sitting out for hours, Garrett and I decided to use the gravy from one of their old cans of food.

&amp;#x200B;

Please imagine the following scenario from Prim’s perspective.

It is 6:15pm, half an hour before dry food time and 45min before wet food time. Mom and dad enter the kitchen. You distinctly hear the sound of delightful canned food being opened! Dad picks you up. You realize that it is time for THE HORRID MEDS! You fight, but the bastards get the disgusting gunk into you anyway, and then do the same to your sister. But there is still some good in this world, because you will get wet food now! Dad carries the opened can of wet food out to where the food bowls are.

And then.

Before your very eyes.

He throws the can INTO THE TRASH.

I wanted to ask about biopsies. I know the vet is going to want to do one if this medicine doesnt clear him up at all. Has anyone ever done a skin biopsy?

Anyway, I been playing with her for one year, we had our rituals, she would call for me in the morning, like she'd climb on my window to get my attention and I'd play with her for a couple of minutes before leaving for work, then when I get back, she'd be greeting me in my yard and I'd play with her. And then a few months later, she had a kitten.

The kitten was scared of me at first, then I began to play with her with a rubber hose, the kitten soon warmed up to me and the mother and daughter team would visit me and I'd play with them. These cats helped me cope with my loss, and I was wondering if the mother cat that visited me after my dog died might be my dog reincarnated to help me cope.

Anyway, about two months ago, my neighbor sent the cats away to live in their family farm, the grandma needed cats for her farm and my neighbor gave them away. I was sad, but not as sad as when my dog died, these cats helped me through a tough time. I'll miss them and I wonder if they miss me too."

677,We took in a kitten and it’s already caused turmoil in the house. Help?,cats,t3_aa8dp0,9,False,False,aa8dp0,"Cat: Dot, 8y, Female, Spayed, Tortie
Kitten: Lucifer “Luke”, 4ish months, Male, not fixed, black kitten

Cut to the chase: My landlord’s cat had kittens and we offered to take one if she couldn’t find a home for them all. We got little man today and it’s already caused so much issue with Dot that I’ve already stress thrown up. They met from a distance, then we put Luke in a 3 foot tall dog pen in our kitchen. Dot has watched, batted and hissed at him every handful of minutes. We live in a one bedroom apartment, we thought it would work but he climbed out pretty freakin quick. So we scattered to collect him before Dot could see and moved him to the bathroom! Unfortunately that’s just an echo chamber for his little meows and Dot just sits outside of the door and growls/hisses. There’s nowhere else we can put him and I’m already exhausted worrying about how I’m going to keep them separate tomorrow. 

I don’t think we’re as ready as we thought we were and I definitely don’t think we have enough room to properly raise a kitten.

Help? "

I got my first cat (Leo) when he was about 3 weeks old, got him fixed at about 6 months old. I had Leo for about 3 years before I adopted a stray that wandered onto my porch. Benjamin was about a year old so I got him fixed too. Recently I've been trying to integrate them into the same space but it seems that Leo is obsessed with and/or hates Benjamin. When they're in the same room, Leo attacks him. Benjamin usually minds his own business. 

So far, I've tried feeding them together. They're bowls are literally touching and they eat with no issues but when the food is gone Leo is right back to attacking Benjamin. This has been happening for about 2 months now. 

I need some ideas on what to try next to make them get along. Please help!"

Do we need to wipe down their fur?  Since getting them my boyfriend has patted them down daily with a wet wash cloth, but is this necessary? I've been told cats are pretty much self cleaning. They never look dirty, they use the litter box ok and do spend time during the day to lick  themselves whenever they want, but they are young. At what age can I trust that they know what they are doing when it comes to kitty hygiene? Yes I know I will need to wash them at some points in the future, but daily pat downs seem kind of excessive for these two kittens which are just getting used to being in a new house away from their mom. "
694,My cat will not stop pooping all over my house,cats,t3_aa5tj0,0,False,False,aa5tj0,"My male cat turned 13 years old in October and has been pooping outside of the litter box since April. Some background: I found out I was pregnant in January and we had a baby girl in September. Since she has come it has gotten progressively worse. 

When the problem initially started it was limited to my dining room, was occasional, and only done at night. We tried having litter boxes on multiple floors (we have a two story home), using uncovered boxes, using unscented litter, even putting a litter box in the dining room. The behavior did not change. We then took him to the vet to make sure it wasn’t a medical issue. After a physical exam and a senior blood work panel the doctor concluded it was behavioral. We tried pheromone collars and confining him to our upstairs (which did seem to work initially since most of his pooping was downstairs), but then he started pooping in more than just the dining room and doesn’t discriminate between upstairs/downstairs or night/day. He is even so bold as too poop right in front of me (I don’t always catch him in the act since I am usually distracted by my 3 month old). We are currently trying a liquid form of the Prozac for a month to see how that works but I am not very hopeful. 

I don’t know what to do. I know this is most likely about the baby but the baby is not going anywhere and I cannot have her crawling around a house that could have cat shit around every corner (in fact, he has pooped directly on her playmat in the past). I feel like the worst pet owner in the world for considering getting rid of the cat since he used to be my baby, but more and more I feel like this may be my only option. What should I do? Has anyone out there had this problem and been able to get their cat back to using the litter box?"

I don’t really mind that she does this. I throw the stuff away after awhile. Although I am curious if this is normal as well (I don’t care what you all think of my cat, it’s just a curiosity thing). I mostly want to know if this is safe.

From what I can tell, she isn’t ingesting anything. It just tends to be chewing on these objects, though I’m sure she is biting off a small amount. Thoughts?"

828,Have a bit of a predicament - adopt an abandoned stray or not? Info inside,cats,t3_aa3sn5,8,False,False,aa3sn5,"Hello wonderful people of /r/cats - I was hoping for some solid cat adoption advice - following a death in the family a lovely little cat, Sid, is in need of a home. Info below: 

I live in a fair sized flat in central London. I already have one indoor-only cat, so am well versed in the ways of Cat. For reasons, I have to decide whether to take on a second cat who is currently outdoor-only and convert her to the joys of being indoors; or whether it's better for her that I find her another home. Cat Tax further down.

I've had Gutenberg for just over a year. He was a rescue, and I have no information from the adoption centre about whether he was ever an outdoor cat. Regardless, he lives happily in my flat and has never shown the slightest interest in going outside. He doesn't even look out of the window.

My Grandmother passed away a few weeks ago and, it transpired, had taken over looking after Sid a few months back. Sid's owners moved away and left her (him?) behind back in the summer. Sid is currently a stray - albeit living in a very comfy, heated box, courtesy of my father's carpentry skills. All the local shelters are full and refuse to take her; and and there's no one in my Grandmother's village who can take her. My parents are travelling twice a day to feed the cat at the moment, and obviously can't do this indefinitely but also don't want to take on a cat.

Needless to say, I am in love with Sid, who is clearly the world's most affectionate furball. She's not at all feral despite her circumstances and clearly likes to be with people. I would very much like to bring her down to London and have space and funds to look after her. However, in order to make this work she would need to learn to love the indoors, due to the way my flat is set up, the hours I work and the frankly terrifying urban fox population. 

I fear my judgement is clouded with emotion at the moment. Help me be objective. 

Is is better for Sid to live with me, a known quantity who is ready and able to love her, but will force her to give up her outside life? Or would it be better for us to find her a shelter and give her chance to be adopted by another household where she would be able to go outside? Or a rogue 3rd option of at least foster her for a little while when we know if Cat A and Cat B get on, or if we need to move her to more accommodating accommodation. 

(For what it's worth, I don't believe ""kill shelters"" are a thing in the UK and I would never put an animal in one if they did exist.)

Would love to hear your thoughts :)

In the bathroom, she is extremely loving, purrs, kneads, wants to cuddle, everything. But in every other room, she is skittish, and doesn't like to be pet most of the time.

Her food and litter box are in the bathroom, which I think may be contributing to this behavior. I have tried catnip, treats, and toys in the other rooms in hopes that will make her realize that every room is a good room.

Has anyone else experienced this, or is this a common issue? Thanks in advance for any insight you may have. "

When she first brought them home, they were very skittish, which we excepted since they just had their world shaken but, but thought they would adjust. 

It’s now been a year, and they still seem terrified of people. They have made very little progress so far, even though they have a room for them selves and access to the whole house, there are no other animals or any small children; if is a quiet and clam atmosphere. They are healthy per the vet, but it breaks our hearts that they seem so scared all the time. 
What can we do to help these two cats be more outgoing and comfortable?"
