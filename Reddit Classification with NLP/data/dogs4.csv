0,[Mod Post][Survey] /r/dogs Official Demographics Survey,dogs,t3_a2pcty,81,False,False,a2pcty,"Hey there, errybody. It's about time we updated our demographic information since our subreddit--and Reddit in general--has changed so much since the last time we did this. I put together a Google survey. All answers are reported anonymously and we won't use the information for anything other than learning about the subreddit and making the subreddit better (and for fun stats like ""most popular dog name in /r/dogs""). It should take less than 10 minutes to complete, maybe a little longer if you have a lot of dogs. 

You'll be asked for the breed of your dog(s) and I added some mixes and non-AKC breeds to the list. The mixes and non-AKC breeds appear first. Scroll down for the AKC breeds listed in alphabetical order. 

Breeds not listed: 

* Mini vs Standard Poodle -- select Poodle

* Jack Russel Terrier --  select Parson Russell Terrier or Russell Terrier

* Catahoula -- added to the end of the list

* Afghan Hound -- added to the end of the list

* Pyrenean Mastiff -- added to the end of the list

* Some other purebred that isn't listed here - select ""other"" at the end of the list

Sorry, everyone. The list is kind of a nightmare to update.

2,[HELP] Got a sick dog chilling at my house and need some advice?,dogs,t3_abidud,29,False,False,abidud," 

So I live on a tropical island and there are plenty of street dogs about. One of the local dogs just ran up to my house and into my living room. He won't eat or drink and is breathing very rapidly. He's also shaking quite badly. He's been like this for about an hour.

I don't know whether he's sick or really freaked out by all the fireworks over the past 24 hours. I've put a fan blowing on him to help cool him down in case he has heat stroke. But any more advice on what I can do? He's ignoring the giant pork bone I put right next to him.

I've tried calling the local rescues but they're not answering, super busy I imagine. He has a collar, but ownership is pretty lose in this part of the world, the dogs just roam around wherever they want.

I'm just chilling with him for now. I don't think taking him to a vet is really an option.

Thanks!"

5,[RIP] Why you should consider a seatbelt for your pet,dogs,t3_ab6xsx,246,False,False,ab6xsx,"I would never go anywhere in a car without a seatbelt, but I never even though about one for my dog. I feel so guilty about it, please consider it for your pet(s).

Warning - graphic

I was taking my little girl to a watch a flyball tournament since we were just getting into it. We were going to meet friends, it was going to be a relaxing and easy day. I put her in the back of my car where I keep blankets for her to lay on. We left a few minutes late but it wasnt a big deal if we were late so I wasnt in a rush.

We got on the highway that had construction happening on both sides so there were concrete barriers on the very edges of both outside lanes. A large piece of trash appeared a couple cars ahead of us on the dotted line next to our lane. The car in front of us panicked when they saw it, swerved one direction to miss the trash and then swerved the other direction to miss the concrete barrier. They lost control of the car, skidded and hit a truck a couple lanes over. I remember the sound of the crunch and thinking that sucks. And then, crap, I realized they were going to bounce off the barrier right towards me. I tried to speed up to get away but then I heard the crunch again as they collided into my rear driver side door. 

My car slid and spun. I was facing the traffic I was just traveling with. I remember thinking it would stop there, but then the car rolled. My view was now blocked and the inside of the cabin was dark because my car was on the hood and roof sliding down the road. I was hanging in my seatbelt and there were sparks all around me as concrete met steel. I remember thinking it will all go black soon.

But somehow the car uprighted itself and stopped. It might have hit the concrete barrier I'm not sure. It was over. I spun around and looked for her in the back. The back window was gone. I looked out a small hole of the driver window that wasnt blocked by airbag. A driver went to pass by the accident and I noticed as he slowly rolled by that he looked away from my car. I realized he was probably worried I was dead. I shoved my fingers through so they would know I was alright. He got out of the car and ran up. He asked if I was ok, i said i was fine, but I need to find my dog. Where is she? Several other people ran up, told me not to move, asked if I was ok. One guy even started praying for me, bless his heart. But i was just screaming about my dog and needing to find her. One of them yelled at me that I should just be happy I'm alive and to not worry about the dog. Then someone said they saw my dog run away but she was alive.

I couldn't take it, I scrambled out the passenger door. I started running in the direction they said she went down the rows of stopped cars waiting for the accident to clear. As I ran people yelled out to me 'your dog went that way' and pointed down the row of cars. I ran probably a half mile down this row of cars. The yells from people got less and less. The row of stopped cars had ended and the cars were moving again. And there she was on the dotted line. Her beautiful face was smashed in and her organs were spilling out. The harness and leash she had on had been ripped from her body and was blowing in the wind behind her. 

I will never get rid of that image. 

TL;DR - I got hit in an accident that rolled my car. My dog got thrown from the car and ran down the highway before getting hit. 

I've thought over the accident hundreds of times. There was no other choice I could have made in the moment that would have been better. I was trapped.

I dont know if it would have saved her but a seatbelt harness or special carrier would have at least kept her in the car and kept her from running away. From my research this technology is newer but getting better. They even crash test them. Please consider a seatbelt harness or some means of safety gear for your pet when they are in the car.

Thank you for all of the messages and condolences. Below are some photos of her.

6,[HELP] I had to kick a dog today..,dogs,t3_abkee4,16,False,False,abkee4,"This comes DAYS after I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/aaq7g3/discussion_for_the_love_of_all_things_good_please/) about being tired of off leash dogs.

To make a long story short, I was on my dog's afternoon walk and was going to turn down the corner when I saw an off leash dog, all the way down the block, who noticed us and started slowly walking in our direction. I decided to cross over to the other side of the street, thinking, ""This is totally safe. The dog is all the way down there, owner will notice if it decides to cross."" I was wrong. 

The slow trot turned in to a run. Dog ran down the block and crossed the street, making a beeline towards my dog. I placed myself in front of my girl but the dog was trying to run around me. So I kicked it. I started yelling, ""HELLO? WHOSE DOG IS THIS?!"" over and over. After I gave it a kick the dog stopped advancing on my girl but didn't walk away and had me cornered. Eventually a man responds and just starts calling the dogs name. The dog crossed the street AGAIN. I yelled out some not-so-friendly words to this dog's owner. 

I really need some advice on how to handle these things as I am at my wit's end. I don't want to have to kick an animal but what else am I supposed to do? Someone suggested carrying citronella spray and I'm looking in to it. It's gotten to such a bad and stressful point that we are looking into moving. 

Advice? Have you gone through this? What did you do?"

Should I mix up my dogs food? Feed it the same food its entire life?

Out of curiousity how long will a 50lb bag of dog food last my golden if I feed him optimally?

Also please include treats.
And do dogs only drink water? Are there any healthy alternatives I can give to him? Not as a substitute, but an addition.

17,[Help] Large Breed Puppy Kibble &amp; Supplements Insights and Recommendations.,dogs,t3_abhblo,13,False,False,abhblo,"Hey everyone,

My Rottweiler male puppy who's now 6 months old has had a history with kibbles not working out.
He came from the breeder on Canidae Grain Free puppy but wasn't eating it very well after a month or so of being on it(I bought a bag of the kibble when I ran out of the amount he came home with). Because of his boredom on Canidae, I switched him to Instinct Rawboost Large Breed puppy. He loved it but I got over paying ~$80 for 20 pounds of food. Next was Victor Grain Free Active Dog &amp;amp;amp;amp; Puppy which was great food at a great price. $50 for 30 pounds. But he was not eating nearly enough despite being active with strict feeding schedules and no treats before hand(I've done all the tips and tricks to get a puppy to eat his food).  I also would add freeze dried toppers crushed up or in chunks to keep it interesting and give extra ""umpfh"" to the food. 
So since Victor failed I put him on Royal Canin Breed Specific Rottweiler Puppy food. It took him a while to get used to it since it was his first time in Grain-inclusive kibble. He loved it but I had a terrible feeling about giving him those bad ingredients, but I needed him to gain back his weight he slowed down on while on Victor. 

I read a good bit on how the right kind of grains aren't actually bad for dogs and if your dog isn't allergic to grain, then there shouldn't be a reason for him to eat Grain Free foods. 

How do you all feel about this? 

Personally I think a dog should have Grain in their kibble(it still being no wheat, corn, and soy AND with that being said, if their digestion is alright with it and there's of course not an allergy to it and it's not the first few ingredients)

Currently he has been on Fromm Gold Large Breed Puppy Grain-Inclusive for the last week or so. He seems to like it and has some meals where he's actually licking the bowl clean. 

I give him a little bit of crushed up Stella and Chewy's duck duck goose freeze dried Mixers mixed with his kibble at each meal.
A half scoop of Joint-Max glucosamine granules(500 mg - full scoop being 1000mg) once a day in the PM meal.
A pump of salmon oil per meal.

I am looking at Missing Link Puppy Formula daily supplement as something to add. I at least wanted to introduce digestive enzymes but I need to do some more research on it and the benefits.

My questions are:
1. What Large Breed puppy kibble do you recommend?

2. Is a grain-inclusive kibble just fine for dogs or is Grain Free *really* better for a dog since it's more ""natural and mimics them eating in the wild""?

3. What supplements do you add to kibble to make it better? 

4. Are digestive enzymes a good supplement to add to a dog's kibble? If so, what enzyme brand do you recommend?

5. Do you think a puppy supplement that contains phosphorus and calcium is alright/safe to add to a large breed puppy's kibble? (I contacted the company and they said it's safe for all sizes of puppies including large breeds, but I am still wary but like the idea)


* I also don't want to commit to a raw diet since he will grow to be about 130 pounds, so cost might be an issue. Also, I don't have the freezer space for meal prepping situations. Kibble and supplements for it are my preferred option. 

Apologies for the long post but any help/information/answers are needed and welcomed!
I'm an avid dog food researcher on my down time and also like brands such as Stella and Chewy's. If someone would like to give opinions on that brand too, that would be awesome :)"
18,[Help] Need alternative to flea drops,dogs,t3_abl2ld,2,False,False,abl2ld,"I posted a while ago looking for advice when my 1 year old, 4 lb chihuahua started chasing imaginary bugs across the house. The vet ruled out everything they could, and narrowed it down to either seizure activity or the revolution flea medication I had applied 48 hours prior to the weird behaviour started. We decided on the 'wait and see' method, and after 2 weeks the behaviour started to calm down, 3.5 weeks after the application of the revolution he stopped chasing the bugs completely. So now what?

Over the counter flea drops were completely ineffective, which led me to go to the vet who prescribed the revolution. That was my only option for flea treatment through the vet because my dog is actually only 3.6 lbs and none of the other flea meds were safe for such a small dog. 

Fleas are a huge problem here and its strangely warm for this time of year so we aren't getting the usual winter break from the fleas. My plan so far is to religiously keep the indoor/outdoor cat flea treated so he doesn't bring them in, and treat the house for fleas. But the poor dog had a flea on him today and is stopping to scratch a few times an hour. Does anyone have any suggestions for flea treatment that doesn't contain the insecticides that topical flea drops do? "

Today while my wife was getting ready for work he just lazily sat on the couch like he always does. Letting us both pet and scratch him, the normal.

But as soon as my wife left for work I went back to the couch to sit with him (again, like I do everyday) and his hair stood up like he was barking at someone outside, and began to growl at me, I could almost see a wild beat in him.

He ran off to hide, I thought something outside might have spooked him, so I followed him with blankets to keep him warm, and a treat to comfort him, but he gave me a small warning bite and has been hiding I think from me ever since.

If I wall past him he growls and his hair stands up again, he is almost acting like I am a threat or a stranger


Edit: I know yesterday was new years and there were fireworks.

25,[Discussion] Thinking about getting a dog for the first time,dogs,t3_abkc4f,4,False,False,abkc4f,"Hi, first of all, I am sorry if this post isn't formatted correctly or not in the right place - I know there is a breed questionnaire, but haven't filled that out yet, as my questions are more of a general nature than breed-specific. 

I have had the thought that I would like a dog for quite some time now, but it was never very concrete as my landlord never allowed it; as I'm now in the process of buying my own flat/apartment, it is becoming more concrete again, so I would like to get some advice.

I'm in my early thirties and work from home, which I have heard is a big plus; however, I do have autism (which wasn't diagnosed till recently). I suffer mainly from social anxiety, which might cause me to come across as aloof or not very engaged when speaking to possible breeders or shelter staff; which brings me to my questions! 

First of all, I love the idea of adopting a rescue dog, and it would not be an issue at all for me that the dog likely would not be a puppy anymore; I would also be happy with a senior dog, and would actually prefer adopting to making use of a breeder.

However, this being my first dog plus the fact that I sometimes have a bit of a hard time with being assertive and ""putting my foot down"", I thought that a shelter dog might not be ideal - dogs with behaviour problems would be a no-go till I'm more experienced. 

I do have some breed preferences; labradors / retrievers would always be my first choice, just due to preference as well as ""beginner friendliness"" (correct me if I'm wrong there!). I take it though that it would be very hard to get such a dog as a rescue. Also, as mentioned before, I might have a hard time convincing shelter staff I would be a good ""adoptive dog parent"" due to my social awkwardness.

Would you under these circumstances recommend trying shelters first (possibly telling them about my issues in advance), or would going through a breeder be the better solution?

I am honestly **totally confused** as to how I should go about housetraining my pup when I first get him. I want to get the pup with me by my side at the office as soon as possible, but I also wanna get him housetrained and not have accidents in the office.

I have also considered a combination of dog-walker and me going home in the middle of a work day to take the pup out, and just sectioning him off in an easy-to-clean part of the house, but this feels not ideal.

29,[Help] My dog doesn't love me anymore. Is it just because he's old?,dogs,t3_abk4wl,3,False,False,abk4wl,"Yeah, this is one of *those* posts. Please forgive me, I needed to vent somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had my dog since I was 6 years old and he has pretty much been my best friend ever since. He's not what someone would describe as a the most ""tame"" dog: he's loud as all hell, anti-social and hostile around other dogs, and a little disobedient and aggressive with his owners, to the point that he scratched and bit my mother and I a number of times throughout his life. That's just the kind of dog he is and yet, I've always loved him with all my heart. He was always my best bud and acted like any other loving dog would: he would come to me whenever I called out to him (heck, I didn't have to say anything, just extending my hand was enough for him to come), he liked it when I pet him and rubbed his tummy, he'd get excited whenever I chased him around the house and the garden, he had fun when we played with his toys, he'd go crazy whenever I had to leave the house and, as soon as I came back, he wouldn't stop jumping and showering me with kisses; heck, he would pretty much do that every morning when I woke up. But everything changed two weeks ago, when I came back home for the holidays. At first everything seemed normal: as soon as he saw me he got all excited and started jumping and kissing me as usual, but the next day he seemed like a completely different dog. Now it seems like he doesn't even want to be around me anymore: he completely ignores me, when I call him he acts like I don't exist, he never comes near me out of his own volition, when I show him his toys and incite him to play with me he looks confused and, worst of all, every time I pet him he starts growling at me. Now I'm afraid of even lifting him up for fear that he might bite me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to fear that he might not recognise me anymore. My mum says that might be it. She says that it's because he's old (15 yo) and that now that I spend 8 months a year away from home to go to college he might have trouble remembering me. Plus he's deaf now, so not hearing my voice might be a big factor in all this.

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't get is why this is happening now. He seemed to recognise me just fine the first day I came back; in fact, I've been going to college for 4 years now and every time I came back nothing seemed to be wrong with him. I also don't see why the fact that he's deaf matters when he was already deaf back when I came home for summer break this year and during that time everything was still fine. And most importantly, he still loves my mum to death like he always has and is still playful and cheerful around her. On that note, He might be old but he's still really healthy; the vet says he might live 3 to 5 more years. So I'm just left here wondering what the fuck is up with him. Does he really not know who I am because he's old? Or does he dislike me for god knows what other reason?

&amp;#x200B;

Either way I'm completely devastated. I've always heard stories of dogs not recognising their owners as they got older, and I've been mentally and emotionally preparing myself for years in case that ever happened to me, but it turns out I wasn't ready after all: I haven't cried in 5 years, but today I broke down just thinking about my dog hating me. Anyone know what might be going on here, or got any suggestions?

32,[Help] dog anorexia,dogs,t3_abevu3,29,False,False,abevu3,"Our akita dog has officially been diagnosed with anorexia. 

This is one of those dogs who can and has preferred to starve itself to death rather than eat. We have gone through over 20 different kinds of food and even raw dog food with appetite stimulant, fish, cheese, egg, diary, food toppers, etc. We always give big praise when she finishes her meal and we try to reward her with a treat like an egg to get a little more food in her. 

Question 1 : We have found a few things that sometimes work but sometimes there are 1-4 days at a time where she will not eat. How do we manage these days? Currently we try to force at least half a meal in her at meal times. We also try to change up the next meal by using a different fish or the other flavor of kibble, less of this, more of that, etc and sometimes she will eat the first half of her meal on her own but beyond that little success. Occasionally we take her meal back and put an egg or yogurt or cheese in it but she still doesn't want it. We read from another akita owner that akitas need a fasting day but in our experience that's just one less day that she eats.  We have tried to feed her a third meal but she just eats that much less for dinner. 


Question 2 : I am very frightened because when I research management of the long term, there is really  nothing out there to read. I've only found one research paper and it was absurdly simple-minded and had nothing new. Even appetite stimulants are only recommended short term. Are there any resources for long-term management?

Question 3 : Why does she shut down and what can we do to stop it? She is moderately interested and starts to eat it but then her ears go way back on her head, she gives the whale eye, and she makes herself small and avoidant, trying to slink away out of sight. Maybe 5 minutes later she burps. But about 60-70% of the time after that initial stopping she is not eating again. 

Background: She was rescued from her first home and we believe she developed much of her disorder there. In her second home, her and another dog ate from the same bowl ( so the dog ate very, very little) and the owner resorted to feeding her whatever she was eating for dinner, but even still the dog was under 50% what it should weigh. 

Current diet: We found a brand of healthy kibble that she likes pretty well, and a different flavor of it. She will just never be a kibble-only dog. Currently her diet is: 1 boiled fish fillet, oatmeal and rice and barley, kibble, fish oil, 1 egg, all mixed together so she can't just eat the fish and walk away. We make sure that the fish and oats mix is warm but not too hot and that the fish oil is distributed so she won't get a yucky mouthful of it and we try to make sure that the kibble is not soggy. 

I maintain my happy and calm face and remove distractions and such. But we are so tired. We spend more and more time fixing her foods and our rituals feel absurd. 

The only thing that I have ever seen her eat like a normal dog was a rare steak for a special occasion. "

Pic of nail: [https://imgur.com/1CcKRdd](https://imgur.com/1CcKRdd)  
She was overly worried so I brought  him to the vet the next day. The vet took a look and thought that it  should be clipped up just below the quick, and more than likely the nail  would grow out and be fine. They clipped that nail and a few others  that were long-ish, and afterwards we were hit with the following:

71$ exam &amp; consult

13.50$ nail trim

39.13  Rimadyl (100mg chews x 7) (He really probably didn't need these, but he  did have a slight limp that the vet thought he noticed)

I've been working at my county's humane society for about 7 months now. A week and a half ago, an owner surrendered a 1.5yo intact male Boerboel. They had raised him from 8 weeks and surrendered him because he had begun to growl at the kids. When your dog is a 140lb Mastiff, you dont take that lightly. The dog was a prime example of his breed, loyal and strong, and just a bit goofy. I fell in love with him immediately. I know that attachment is not the best in my line of work, but it was love at first sight. 

Over the last week, I found that he was a smart boy - caught on to the shelter routine in one day, listened when I told him not to mess with the gate, even head great leash manners. His previous owners had clearly put a lot of effort into his training. At the same time, we discovered that he wasn't growling because he didn't like kids. He chased shadows that werent really there. He spooked at leaves falling and at birds flying away. He was suspicious of anyone that wasnt me. There was clearly someyhing neurological going on, and it was getting worse.

Anyway, we put him to sleep yesterday. I was basically the only person he trusted, so I gave him the sedatives and stayed until they kicked in. I held his massive head as he went. It was peaceful - minimal stress and lots of yummy wet food. I cried a lot last night. He would have been my ideal dog. I loved him, but we couldn't fix him.

They started with following from a distance on the other side of the road, but after a bit they crossed and started quickening their pace towards me. I guess Barrett picked up on that because as we were walking he turned to stare at them more and more frequently. When the guys were about 10ish feet behind me at Barrett stopped and refused to move no matter how much a pulled on the leash (he has a pinch collar so I knew he was serious). He kept starring and growling at the guys until they got visibly nervous and turned a corner. There have been a lot of robberies around town over the past few weeks so I felt a lot safer with my pup. He isn‚Äôt normally growly or aggressive towards others outside the house so this was a huge switch in his normal behavior. I knew he had my back in the situation though since I was (kind of obviously) very stressed and nervous that they were coming up behind so fast. Every few steps he‚Äôd just turn around and watch them until they were so close that would just refuse to budge. Such a good boy!"

We have another dog who is a big, lunging, territorial boy but we're putting in the training and effort to have control in tough situations. Dog tax at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Our old dog is \~11, has bad spinal arthritis and gets laser therapy 2x a month. She's a steady dog but is 50/50 on meeting new dogs. She's a mutt with a lot of herding breeds and so her version of playing is either chasing or pinning dogs. For the most part in public we keep her close by, block any dogs from greeting, let their owners know we don't want to play, and it's much less stressful for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was a busy day at the vet. The moment we walk through the door there was a dog on a retractable leash lunging at my dog. The owner was desperately, unsuccessfully, trying to hold this 80+ pound dog back. She told me, ""he is friendly, he's just really excited"" and gives up trying to hold him back. Not okay! It's not my fault you have zero control of your dog. I ended up backing my girl into a corner to block their dog off and told her that my dog isn't great with greeting dogs on a leash. She and her teenager try to wrangle him back, and continue to do this for the 5 minutes they have to wait, while other dogs go in and out of the waiting room. The lady's daughter even stayed over by me and petted my dog until they had to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

In the time we were waiting, a 2-3 month old Golden came in and excited the crazy dog. This puppy was better behaved. Then someone came to pick up 2 huskies from boarding - you know how dogs are when they see their owner - so crazy dog got even crazier. A vet tech even came out to help them get it under control. All they ended up doing was dragging him into an exam room.

&amp;#x200B;

While my dog was in her laser session, another owner comes in with a big dog on a retractable leash and lets it wander all over the waiting room. I don't understand why people do this? We're all in a cramped space, there are dogs of all sorts coming and going, and people think that because their own dog is friendly everyone else's will be fine. This blows my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

My girl weathered the whole thing. She stayed in contact with my legs, watched all the excitement, patiently let the excitable dogs sniff her when they got out of their owner's control, and only growled when one got too personal. She let the crazy dog's little girl pet her for the extent of their wait and even licked her on the nose. I could not be prouder of her.

&amp;#x200B;

I get the crazy dog thing, though, I really do, but that's why it's so important to understand the commitment of a dog. They need training, they need practice, and they need patience. I think a lot of people get dogs and believe that they will learn everything easily, but sometimes (a lot of times?) it takes more. Our second dog is a 90 pound Great Pyrenees / cattle dog. He is a piece of work. He's big, pushy, territorial, and reactive. We are working on it. We hired a trainer and committed to the time and practice he needs. He's not perfect, but I know that we have structure for the difficult situations. We can go to the vet and he will stay by my side instead of lunging at dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm frustrated. It was such a stressful event to go to the vet today, but I also understand how this happens. Mostly I just wish people understood the correct use of retractable leashes (which is almost none) and that dogs take training and commitment.

I have two dogs, and one of them has pretty severe anxiety and is quite reactive.
We do training, work with a behaviourist, socialise the Hell out of him and have since day 1 but he's still messed up.
As a result he gets Prozac daily. Has made a huge improvement but still far from ""perfect"".
Our vet has given us an emeegency stash of Trazadone. It's pretty potent stuff.
Tonight the fireworks started and he freaked out. Growling, barking, had his teeth out at me... He was proper freaked.
Gave him the Trazadone and now he's zonked. He's just laying here, not reacting to anything but also clearly drugged up.
Just feeling guilty for the apparent necessity of it and wanted to share in case there's others out there facing this issue tonight!"
51,[Discussion] I‚Äôm a piece of sh*t for this,dogs,t3_abg9ed,10,False,False,abg9ed,"I am a piece of shit and I feel like one. And I still cry because of that. And it just happened a few hrs ago. 


And I think I am masochistic (hope it‚Äôs a word) because I came to write it here on a dog lovers subredit because I feel I will be hated for this and I feel I deserve it. 

After new years eve, just in the morning of 1st of january, I went out to say goodbye to my friends that were leaving etc. 

Suddently I see a nice beautiful dog, a bit thin, but very educated. She seemed very confused, a stranger just yelled at her because she was in the way of his parked car. 

When I called her, she instantly came to me. Like she trusted me for years. And She was so soft and very lovable. She was mature, it could be seen she had some babies but the breasts were long and ‚Äòold‚Äô, they were not fresh. So she might have been a bit old. I‚Äôm not sure. However I‚Äôve never seen such an educated dog. It was clear she was either lost or thrown away. I hope she was just lost. She seemed to look for ‚Äòher human‚Äô. 

I went to some houses nearby asking people if they have seen or know who this dog is. Nobody could help. AND SHE CAME WITH ME, patiently waiting every time when I talked to people, she always sit in the ‚Äòsit position‚Äô and acted so damn educated. I‚Äôm fucking crying typing this. 

I went and bought her dog food. She didn‚Äôt eat. She followed me everywhere. In the end I got back to the house and my friend said she followed her up until the bus station. 

Seriously. I am a piece of shit! I thought of taking her. I really wanted a dog and I feel it was a sign in my opinion. However I do have health issues that make me be already helped by other people. There is no way I could take care of her without ‚Äòextra help‚Äô. And people didn‚Äôt want her. 
I thought we were also 90% of the time not home and I don‚Äôt live in a yard but in an appartment. 


Overall, she still wanders the streets.  I didn‚Äôt want to keep her just for one night then throw her away. A part of me still wants her in my life. But she is gone and i‚Äôm unable to take care of any animal. But it still makes me a piece of fucking shit for letting her. I thought I could do more. But I just listened to others!
You can hate me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. I think I deserve the hate. I can‚Äôt call myself a ‚Äòdog lover‚Äô anymore..."
52,[help] Alpha Dog Myth,dogs,t3_abdmjo,19,False,False,abdmjo,"Ugh, I‚Äôm so frustrated and just need some advice, I quest. 

So my aunt, who‚Äôs never had a dog and who doesn‚Äôt seem to even like them very much, decided she knew more about dog behavior and psychology than I‚Äîa person who has had multiple dogs for the entire 25 years I‚Äôve been alive, who loves dogs more than anything, and who has spent countless hours researching dog training techniques to use with my very anxious beagle. 

Of course she believes in the alpha dog myth and when I tried to explain, in a calm and reasonable manner, that that theory has been disproven‚Äîby the very man who came up with it no less‚Äîshe bit my head off and pulled out that frustrating ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just agree to disagree because we both have different opinions‚Äù response, even though my point isn‚Äôt an opinion because it‚Äôs backed by facts and research. 

My parents told me to just ignore her but it‚Äôs so frustrating! I feel very passionately about this because the alpha myth has led to people inadvertently harming dogs for decades. I guess I can take some small comfort in knowing she‚Äôll probably never have a dog and therefore won‚Äôt have the opportunity to harm one with it. I just wish I wasn‚Äôt stuck in a cabin with her for so many days. 

I need help coming up with a response for the next time she inevitably tries to give me advice about how to take care of my own dog, like the time she told me never to comfort a dog when they‚Äôre scared because that just encourages them to be scared in the future. "

**Abstract:** 

&gt; The current research examined dog's ability to dsicriminate between different amounts of food. Using a two alternative forced choice procedure dogs werre required to discriminate between a constant amount of 4 pieces of food and another amount that varied across a range from 1 to 7 pieces. The dogs reliably selected the larger of two alternatives. Discrimination was better when there were fewer rather than more than 4 pieces of food available on the varying alternative. Specifically, 1 was discriminated from 4 more easily than 4 was discriminated from 7 pieces of food. These results confirmed the ability of dogs to discriminate food amount on a psychophyical choice procedure.

She's usually a bit shy, but sometimes she'll choose a person she  absolutely must say hi to.

The woman laughed and slowly approached, which my dog did a ""woo woo!"" for. This poor woman got so scared that she dropped everything she was holding. When she bent down to pick her stuff up, my girl  respected her space but still booty wiggled, tap danced, and cried for attention. The woman slowly reached a hand up to pet her and that was it. She explained she's deathly scared of doggies because of a past experience.

Long story short, the lady walked away, thanking us for letting her spend time with my dog (five minutes in the middle of the street. my dog was so happy)  and saying, ""I think I'm going to get one of you, soon!"" to my girl. Made me so proud.

57,[HELP] Normal Dominance in Dogs?,dogs,t3_abfgxa,1,False,False,abfgxa,"Before Christmas, our oldest girl passed away. She was our first dog and we always maintained she was the alpha among the other dogs. Three months after adopting Old Girl, we brought a 5 week old pit mix into our family. The two of them were best friends. On the off chance they escaped our yard, Pittie would nudge Old Girl home and keep her warm in colder months (Old Girl was a 15 pound mix).

In July, we brought home a 2 month old Lab mix. She quickly learned her place in the hierarchy and all went on their merry way. 

Fast forward to the day after Christmas. We found ourselves at local shelters, agreeing that we would only bring home a dog if we thought they would fit with Pittie and Lab. We found a beautiful, sweet one year old Border Collie mix that we fell in love with. All signs pointed to her and she was amazing with our kids.

We did slow introductions, introducing Lab first. We then introduced Pittie and Border off property and took them for a walk. They did great and we took them home to the back yard, letting them run together. All three did wonderful!

Our son came outside and immediately Pittie had Border cornered and wouldn‚Äôt let her near our son. This happened once and we have monitored all activities with our kids and the dogs present since. Pittie has never shown any dominance traits. She responds to my commands above anyone else, going as far as having a live prey animal in her mouth and dropping on command leaving the animal unharmed.

The three still play well outside, however, once inside, Pittie can just walk by Border and Border is laid out under her, surrendering.

I‚Äôve never seen this behavior in Pittie and have never seen this behavior in general, as Old Girl was much smaller than the other two and would only bark or growl.

Is this something we should be watching closely? Is there anything extra we should be doing to deter this? As of now, we do what the vet at the shelter told us to do, which is show Pittie attention first and reward her for good behavior before rewarding Border. 

There are no issues between Pittie and Lab. And there are no issues between Border and Lab."

We told him she probably passed in her sleep, but there's a pool of blood around her nose. 

She has been sick for some time (Chronic pancreatitis).  Mom warned that we'll need to put her down before the end of the year. Mom knew and tried her hardest to help him prepare. 

But the look on his face is so heartbreaking. He just lost both of his parents 3 years ago and within a month of each other. I knew this was going to be a difficult loss for the family.

Tomorrow is Dad's birthday. I feel lost on what to do to help him. I've never seen him this upset. My family has not dealt with the loss of a pet since the early 80s.

62,[Breeds] Low energy + medium size dog breed?,dogs,t3_abd855,18,False,False,abd855," \*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* No. I have a dog currently that I trained from a puppy. I also have helped train a family dog from 8 weeks old.  

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* I don't really have a preference. I've always gone through reputable breeders so I'm more comfortable with that process but if I can find the right dog for me I'm open to rescuing  

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* easy to train, lovable/cuddly, chill, doesn't mind being home alone for most of the day  

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* I haven't narrowed it down. I'm looking for lower energy dogs but it seems like that is mostly giant breeds or small dogs. I've wanted a great dane but I'm not sure I can deal with the drool and having to go through their short lifespans. My current dog is small (20lb F Puggle) so bringing a young giant breed into the family would probably upset her immensely. I've always had labs so I'm not a big fan of small dogs even though I have one now. I'm open to considering a Pug or another Puggle but the short nose breeds and their health problems kind of freak me out.    

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* basic obedience such as sit stay come shake

  \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* 1-2 hours. I work evenings and I'm gone for about 10.5 hours during the day when I work.   

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* Probably a half hour or less. Usually inside play. I do like taking my current dog to the dog park but we don't get out much lately. If the new dog I get is a puppy or very young I would hire a dog walker or a friend to give them a walk while I'm at work.  8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* Brushing once a week or more is fine. I can also do everything other than trimming hair. My current dog hates having her nails done because her quicks are abnormally wide so clippers hurt her more than I'm used to with other dogs I've trimmed.  

 \*\*Personal Preferences\*\* 

 9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Medium to Large. I'm pretty much open to everything other than tiny or yippy dogs. 

 10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* Not so much slobber and barking. Shedding is part of being a pet owner  

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* meh. I can't do that with my dog without an e-collar (I only beep) so if I can't do it with my next dog either its not a deal breaker.   

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* snuggly or little bit of both. I don't want them to be so needy that they have separation anxiety when I leave for work.  

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?  \* Again, middle is best if not eager-to-please  

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I would prefer my current dog not bark and freak the heck out but not much I can do about that now. I'd like it to be friendly and not scare people away.  

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* Absolutely not.   

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?  \* Food/toy aggression, prey instinct towards my current small dog  

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* 5 days a week/10.5 hours a day  

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* Live alone  

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* Puggle (pug/beagle)  

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* Semi-regularly (friends kids and nieces/nephews but no kids of my own)  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I own 

 22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* I don't believe there are any breed specific laws in my location  

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* I live in Wisconsin. Some winters the wind chill has gotten to -35F. I'm aware some dogs may not tolerate that. I also keep the AC pretty cold in the summer so a cold weather dog would be okay.  

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* I'm having trouble finding a medium sized dog that is pretty low energy. I know it often depends on the dog (my family has a crazy lazy lab because it has adapted to their lazy lifestyle) and how it adapts to my lifestyle, but I don't want to make a dog suffer or act out because its brimming with untapped energy. I often have my family dog (80lb F Lab) and brother's dog (15 week old M lab puppy) around my dog and will need my future dog to be good with both small and large dogs for that reason.  I've done several breed selector quizzes and they come up with many of the giant breeds with short lifespans and big slobbers. Even though I think it would be fun to have a giant dog I'm not sure its the best idea.

74,"[Breeds] Looking for a friendly pup, what breeds will be right for me?",dogs,t3_abavy7,5,False,False,abavy7,"**\*\*Introduction\*\***

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* It will be my first dog as a primary owner. I had a Lab growing up. I did not participate in the training.

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

* I do not. If I can rescue a young mix of the breed that will work best for me, I will do that. If one does not need adopting, I will seek a breeder. I prefer a younger dog to ensure proper training.

3. Describe your ideal dog.

* Friendly, eager to please, intelligent, sturdy, medium-sized,

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I was looking seriously into the Swedish Valhund, but after doing some research they are sadly too active for our lifestyle. The robustness, friendliness, and intelligence made them extremely attractive to me.\* Eurasiers - seem to be easygoing, quiet, and friendly. I've read that they match your activity level, which would be nice for us since summers will be more active than winters. They seem trainable but with somewhat of a sassy personality.
* Finnish Lapphund, Braque du Bourbonnais, and Broholmer all looked great on the AKC website, but further research shows them to be kind of rare? Are there any similar breeds you can recommend?

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I would like the dog to be able to join me to social events. Trusting him/her with basic commands like sit/stay/come is required. I do not intend to do any herding/sniffing tasks with this dog. A few parlor tricks may be trained but nothing terribly out of the ordinary for a companion dog.

**\*\*Care Commitments\*\***

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 1-2 hours

7. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* I intend to do a short \~30 minute walk in the mornings, and then about an hour walk after work during the weekdays. On weekends I would like to take the dog on short hikes with my friend's dog - hopefully off-leash to encourage activity but it depends on the personality (hikes would be about an hour or two, most likely). We have a dog park nearby that I will take the dog to for socialization a few times a week.
* In the winter it gets extremely rainy and cold, so there will likely be less exercise on these days. We will probably go down to 1 walk, for roughly a half hour. If anyone has tips on how to exercise your dog when it's pouring I am open to ideas!

8. How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Regular brushing I am okay with. Ears and nail clipping is fine. I am not interested in trimming hair.

**\*\*Personal Preferences\*\***

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* \*Medium. Smaller than a Lab. Sturdy/robust enough to wrestle with the boys or go on camping trips ideally.

10. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I don't mind. Barking and slobber are not acceptable. Chattering/mumbling is okay, but if it comes with actual barking/howling that will be a problem.

11. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I'd love to be able to let the dog off-leash on trails and campgrounds, but this is not an everyday occurrence so not a high priority requirement.

**\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\***

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in-between. I want an affectionate dog that does not need constant attention.

13. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please

14. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* No barking or jumping. A healthy curiosity is fine but I don't want anyone to be scared away before the door even opens. I can't manage an aggressive dog.

15. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

16. Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* The dog needs to be okay around children and small pets.
* I do not appreciate licking.

**\*\*Lifestyle\*\***

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* My husband and I both work during the day and will be out from 7-4ish. Besides that the dog will rarely be left alone. Even then, I have 2 adult indoor-only cats who are very playful so the dog will not be totally isolated.

18. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Only other preference is no small or skittish dogs. My husband and I will share equal roles in training and caring for the dog.

19. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have 2 indoor-only, average sized cats. I do not plan on adding any other animals once we adopt the dog.

20. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. We have a few friends with children and are considering having one of our own.

21. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I own my house. It has front/back yards with moderate space to run around.

22. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live near Seattle, WA. There is apparently a pit bull ban/restriction, but I only know that because I looked it up just now. It is not enforced as far as I can tell. There are quite a few pit bulls &amp; pit bull mixes in our area.

23. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer: 70s. Very sunny, warm, often breezy.
* Winter: 40s. Icy, rainy, sometimes snow.

**\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\***

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I have a fenced in front and back yard, both with grass that the dog can play in. There are a lot of dog-friendly parks and businesses nearby so socialization won't be an issue.
* I go to most of the comic/video game conventions in the area. Depending on the dog's personality I would like to bring them along (outside only, of course). The dog would need be able to be around large groups of strangers without becoming skittish or aggressive.

75,Just got a rescue dog advice and tips [help] [pitbull],dogs,t3_abc0jy,6,False,False,abc0jy,"For the record my household consists of my dad and mom ,my younger brother (22) his gf has her own place as well but visits alot. My gf (24) and me (24). 

Okay so I have a few questions for anybody regarding Rescue dogs. 

Now it wasnt from a shelter or anything. My older brother said that his first owners didnt treat the dog well in that he was always in a cage and didnt  really eat (he used to be super skinny.)  Might have been abused. 

My older brothers friend took him from that home for alittle bit  but he couldn't keep him because he was moving away.

So my older brother had him for 3 weeks and he couldn't keep him because of his cat (couldnt get along after 5 days and he didnt is probably scared of dogs. My older brother also has a female and Male pitbull that are older but they all eventually got along (not sure about the Male one ) 

 My older brother said he might be afraid other dogs because he hasn't been around then most of his life.

Hes such a happy loving dog and I think we are going to keep him but we are going to wait and see how he adjusts to our his new environment and it's up to my mom and dad.  He also yelped and was scared of my younger bro this morning after my bro put on colenge 


We had  previous pitbull that lived until 9 (passed away from cancer) he was a pitbull mix with an eighth of rotwielr and he was the nicest dog ever. But again he didnt get along with other dogs because he got attacked by two when he was a puppy.


TLDR : We recently took in  rescue dog and was wondering tips about training him to not constantly pull us when walking him and hes also scared of the wooden kitchen floor because he slipped twice. Healso might have been abused when he was growing up but now he has a loving home. Haven't had a dog since 2013.

I will post a pic of him later when I get the chance "

She is unable to control her bladder really. It appears she might be going blind. I do not want to put her down because she is still happy and very loving and, on her good days, extremely active. She is curious and attentive and caring. I don't want to put her down simply because having to clean up her urine is an inconvenience. She is still a member of the family. Please advise! Thank you."

80,[Breeds] What breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_abdpqr,1,False,False,abdpqr,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I had a Rat Terrier growing up, and I have an adopted Chihuahua-Dachshund mix now. I‚Äôve grown up around dogs, and I was always a dog nerd as a kid.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Definitely prefer going to a rescue, but MAYBE open to a breeder if the right breed/mix isn‚Äôt in a shelter, though likely not.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I‚Äôd love a dog to cuddle with, my Chiweenie is super stubborn (Which I love), but I‚Äôd like a dog that‚Äôs more obedient. Kind and friendly, playful is a must. Preferably loves fetch, but that‚Äôs just a great side effect.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I love border collies, because of their sheer intelligence and I could take it hiking and maybe search and rescue or agility or something. I‚Äôd like something more medium-sized, I already have a Chiweenie, and while I love my small dogs, I‚Äôd like a medium sized dog (I‚Äôm a small person so for me to control it physically while training, I‚Äôd say between 25-45 pounds).

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I‚Äôm highly interested in training search and rescue or maybe agility, or just some awesome dog tricks.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Honestly my life revolves around my one dog already, as he even goes to the office with me on most days, so I can spend a lot of time with it. Must be a good traveler though.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* My current dog and I make frequent trips to the dog park, and he comes with my to the office most of the time, where I give him several short walks when I‚Äôm feeling tired of phone calls. Other days, he goes with me door to door canvassing neighborhoods. I‚Äôd love to train some agility, and definitely into search and rescue. At least one good walk a day is guaranteed though.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I‚Äôve always had short haired dogs, so I‚Äôve done most grooming on my own. However, my parents had a Flat-Coated Retriever who got professionally trimmed once or twice a year, and I‚Äôd be ok with paying for that. Brushing I can do, and ear cleaning is not a problem.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Preferably a medium-sized dog. I‚Äôm a small person and am currently by myself, so for me to control it physically (not get dragged around during training), I‚Äôd prefer a 25-45 pound dog. I have had small dogs in the past, but I‚Äôve always thought the small dog- bigger dog combo was cute.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* My Chiweenie is pretty mouthy, so I‚Äôm used to barking. Shedding, well that‚Äôs what vacuums and lint rollers are for. Slobber isn‚Äôt my favorite thing, but if it‚Äôs the right dog, then I wouldn‚Äôt mind that much.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*  My current dog is always on a leash, except at the dog park (which is fenced), and I always stay close, so not a huge issue.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I love snuggling with my Chiweenie, so definitely snuggly.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* I‚Äôd LIKE a dog that‚Äôs more obedient and open to training, but my current dog is really stubborn and I love that about him, in a sense. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking is ok, preferably not really *aggressive*, as I do take my dog(s) a lot of places. Doesn‚Äôt have to be that dog that falls apart at a stranger‚Äôs attention but definitely not aggressive.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, as I do have another dog so that obviously wouldn‚Äôt be a good decision.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* As long as it‚Äôs not too severe and can be fixed/trained out, I‚Äôm fine. Aggression would be a really bad thing considering being in public with people. Fear wouldn‚Äôt be too bad, as I could work with that. Basically anything able to be trained out and where I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about biting would be fine.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not often. I take my current dog most places, so I don‚Äôt see a problem adding another one to a trip.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I currently live alone, and I have a rule that if they don‚Äôt like my dogs, they can leave.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*I do have a Chihuahua-Dachshund mix, he‚Äôs currently a year old but I‚Äôm not looking to adopt a dog within the next couple of years (doing this out of curiosity when the time comes, because I‚Äôd like to do a ton of research before I get it). I‚Äôd potentially love to have other pets like a rat, a ferret, etc.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No, I‚Äôm 19 and don‚Äôt have kids, don‚Äôt want them, and it‚Äôd be rare to come across a young kid in my office (it‚Äôs a political office).

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I will rent, but I‚Äôm used to working with having my dog and having the place that will allow my dogs (I travel for work, so housing changes).

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Not that I know, and the dogs on the top ten list for ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù dogs are too big for me. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* We travel a lot, so preferably able to handle hotter temperatures (no bulldogs, etc). But for winter, I do have coats and sweaters and I prefer warmer temperatures indoors so we can be warm together.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Not much, just must be a good traveler. Long drives are no fun with a nervous/car sick dog (though I did teach my Chiweenie to like car rides).

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  "
81,[Help] Great Pyrenees feeding/diet help?,dogs,t3_ab8s6f,13,False,False,ab8s6f,"Hi all, new subscriber here. I was hoping maybe someone would have some advice for me on this subreddit. 

In May of this year we adopted a Pyrenees mix puppy from a rescue. She‚Äôs about 11 months old now. She has never been super interested in food but we‚Äôve always been able to find ways to entice her to eat (adding a bit of pumpkin, carrots/peas, or peanut butter to her kibble); however, as of late she‚Äôs just not interested. When she does eat, it‚Äôs not as much as she should be eating based on what we know about her weight/breed. In the first few months, she was gaining about 7-8 pounds per month, but now she‚Äôs barely gained 10 since August. 
:( We‚Äôve just swapped out her kibble for a protein based food as opposed to the grain based kibble she was eating (both from a high quality, large breed brand). We‚Äôve had our vet do blood work to make sure there‚Äôs not something internally causing this issue (we initially had concerns about Addison‚Äôs) and everything came back just fine. He said as long as she continues to gain some weight then there‚Äôs no need to be worried, but I can‚Äôt help it! All of her siblings are now a solid 25+ pounds heavier than she is (although we are fairly certain that she is the runt of the litter and she‚Äôs only 1 of 2 girls from her litter- but even her sister is much larger than she is.) We also don‚Äôt know what the litter is mixed with- is it possible she‚Äôs just more of ‚Äúthe other breed‚Äù than she is Pyrenees? 

I‚Äôve also read that Pyrs are notoriously picky eaters so maybe this isn‚Äôt that unusual? I‚Äôm just seeing a lot of conflicting advice about what to do with her diet. First I read to supplement her meals with extra protein (boiled chicken, eggs, etc.) but then I read that this is reinforcing her picky behavior because now she will hold out for the good stuff and not eat her kibble! I‚Äôm so frustrated. At the end of the day, we just want her to be happy and healthy (both our vet and trainer say she is healthy and lean, she‚Äôs by no means skin and bones or anything, but I‚Äôve never had a dog who won‚Äôt eat!) does anyone have any advice? Or anecdotes about your pyrfectly picky Pyrs? :) Thanks in advance! "

87,[discussion] I made a mistake that probably caused my boy so much pain.,dogs,t3_abdd5c,15,False,False,abdd5c,"I recently got a Dogtra collar for his training that the trainer recommended. It definitely works, but I didn‚Äôt take enough time to read the instructions since I tend to have the mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll figure it out as I go‚Äù. I had all of the controls figured out. Never used the zaps since I‚Äôm not mentally ready for that. Well, what I missed from not reading the instructions was that you shouldn‚Äôt keep the collar on too long and should change its position on your dog often. I only realized that mistake when I took it off of him a few minutes ago to give him a bath. The prongs got into his skin and the underside of the collar‚Äôs box and surrounding fur was wet (I assume from the fluid coming from the holes to prongs made). I feel absolutely awful that I did take time to read the instructions for what I was putting on my best friend and I‚Äôve been crying ever since I took it off from how much pain he was probably in from all of that. He couldn‚Äôt tell me it was digging in and my negligence probably made him suffer so much... the wound was obviously very red, but there wasn‚Äôt any blood. The vet is closed, but as soon as it opens I‚Äôm taking him to get it looked at ASAP. He won‚Äôt let me look at the spot and practically sprints when I reach for it, but keeps coming back since I‚Äôve been crying so hard about it. How could I do something so dumb? How could I care about another living creature so much, but not even read the user manual for more than 2 pages? What kind of dead beat dog dad am I? Do I even deserve a dog? Obviously not. I wish I could explain to him how sorry I am. He‚Äôs been itching at the collar for the past couple days and was shaking (like what dogs do when they‚Äôre wet) when he was completely dry, but I didn‚Äôt even notice that it might‚Äôve been because of the collar. The moment I saw to wounds I tried to look through his past medications that I still had left to see if there was anything I could start giving him until the vet is open. All he had that could probably help was some antibiotics and stuff for itching (from when he got neutered a few months ago). I‚Äôll give him those until the vet says otherwise. I‚Äôm such an idiot. How could I make such a mindless mistake? And any hate I get for this is definitely well deserved. What kind of idiot would do something like this? I guess me obviously... 

As I write this it‚Äôs been about a half hour, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about what an awful dog dad I am. My mom said a shower would make me feel better, but I can‚Äôt get my boys pain out of my head. I might be overreacting, but the thought of it just keeps bringing me to tears. He‚Äôs helped me so much but I couldn‚Äôt even do that much for him in return. "

We really have a specific breed/personality in mind (golden or lab retriever) and have not had great luck with rescues. Either they have had strict rules we have not met or our trial adoptions failed because the dog had severe separation anxiety. We work full time and a puppy is not feasible.

He was fine with them when I first got them a few months ago, but now he will shake in fear when I pick one up. Here's the part I don't understand, he's not afraid of all three everyday. One day he will be fine with one, but the other two scare him, the next day it'll be a different one. He's a 1.5 yes old 55lb lab/ pit mix.

91,[Help] Senior dog wants to eat all the time,dogs,t3_abd0n7,0,False,False,abd0n7,"I have a 14 year old mutt who has always been an extremely picky eater, sometimes going for a day or two between eating.

She wants to eat all day. Her thirst has not increased. 

I took her to the vet and they ran a blood panel that came back fine, but something still doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. Could this crazy appetite be a symptom of dementia?

92,[HELP] Dog growls when cuddling,dogs,t3_ab8e6b,12,False,False,ab8e6b,"I'm pet sitting for this adorable labradoodle for 3 weeks. We're about 2 days in and he has been showing signs of aggression. He will run up to me and sit on my lap (even though he's really too big) or lay on me if he can, and put his head on my lap or next to my face etc. Clearly trying to be as close as possible. If I stop petting him he'll nudge my hand with his nose and nuzzle harder. But eventually he'll start to growl and show his teeth. I've tried avoiding petting him in places that it seems like the behavior starts. For instance, the first time I was scratching behind his ears, so I tried avoiding the head and just slowly petting his back, but it doesn't seem to be connected with touching a certain place. I also tried saying ""no"" firmly, but not yelling and walking away, but he will immediately press his whole weight against me and then I have to basically push him off. He's normally pretty timid. His owner said that he usually hides under the bed when a new person comes, but he came right up and tried to jump on me and was very playful. She also said he only ""play growls"". I'm not sure what to do because as soon as I lay down to go to sleep he wants to lay directly on me, but I'm not going to let a dog that is snarling press his face against my neck while I'm sleeping. I'm not afraid of him, but it's not really conducive to getting a good nights sleep. I tried putting him in his own bed in the other room with his special blanket, but as soon as I close the door he is scratching and howling and throwing his full weight against it. I'm not sure how to solve this, because I'm not initiating the contact, and I don't want to deprive him of affection, but I don't want to reward his behavior."

Ive already made an appointment with a vet for Wednesday this week but Im just asking out of curiosity

Its a lab retriever, she will be 10 in February. She has a lump about the size of a dime, I dont see any irritation. Its pretty solid but I feel I can move it back and forth kind of like a tendon. I dont think shes in any severe pain but she does limp on that leg occasionally. She likes to lick that paw area quite a bit. For further reference its on the outside of her left leg.

Anyone have any ideas on this?"

99,[HELP] At my wits end with rescue pit AND boyfriend.,dogs,t3_aba0ue,11,False,False,aba0ue,"I‚Äôm hoping someone has some ideas because this dog is starting to ruin my home and put a serious strain on my relationship.

6 months ago my boyfriend and I decided to adopt a dog together. We already have a 5 year old pit that we‚Äôve had since she was a puppy and she‚Äôs a rockstar. We found out about a year and a half male pit who was with a rescue from our local grocer. We introduced him to our other dog and they got along fine, we bring him home, then the issues start.

I will say my boyfriend and I have differing philosophy‚Äôs on raising a dog. He believes in ‚Äúletting a dog be a dog‚Äù and does not want to train with commands, teach them not to jump, or have them learn tricks. I‚Äôm okay with most of that, but I feel like teaching dogs to not jump is a part of good behavior. This dog weighs almost 70lbs, when he jumps on you or walks on you, it doesn‚Äôt tickle.

The main issue we have with him is absolutely constant accidents. We got the dog at 18 months and for the first year of his life he was forced to live almost exclusively in a cage where he was only let out to stud and make money for his heroin addict owner. Needless to say he hates crates. We still have to put him in because we work and if we leave him out he will have accidents everywhere. When he is out and we are home he almost never has accidents, but he cannot be trusted at all outside the crate when we are not here and becomes aggressive to the point of scaring me when I try to put him in, to the point that I usually will never do it and make my boyfriend unless I have no choice. For example today I am off and he is working and I tried to put him in with a toy and treats and he was still growling and nipping at my fingers and showing teeth to the point that I gave up and let him stay out. I took him out to potty before I left and he went. I came home to 5 poops and a pee after being gone only 2 hours. I am at my wits end. I want to send him to a professional trainer but my boyfriend is against it saying it won‚Äôt help and it‚Äôs basically just a way for people to get their dominance rocks off by making dogs roll over. But I cannot continue to live this way. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you."

102,[Help] Recent toy possessiveness/aggression in our dog,dogs,t3_abbxbs,4,False,False,abbxbs,"Hi there. I wanted to see if anyone has experience with what my wife and I are experiencing with our rescue.

We rescued our mini poodle mix about 3.5 years ago, and she's now about 4.5 years old. She's healthy, well fed, on a regular flea a tick med regimen, has her teeth professionally cleaned and is groomed by our vet. Overall, she's a good and happy pup.

She does experience separation anxiety, and for this, we give her a regular dose of 75 mg Zylkene. 

Within the last few months, she's grown possessive of her toys to the point of growling, nose butting and nipping when we try to take them from her. She'll play fetch regularly for a few rounds, but at some point, she holds the toy and will grow aggressive when we try to take it. It never happened within the first 2 or so years, then it only happened when strangers played with her (which was rare) and over the last few months, we see it with close family that she knows well and even my wife and I. 

When it happens, we take away the toy, correct her verbally and stop play. But the growing regularity of it is very concerning.

Long time lurker, first time poster in r/dogs. I'm so glad to be a part of this community. My husband and I just adopted the sweetest rescue puppy today. We have been waiting for this moment for a while (we finally have a house with fenced in backyard and a dog park across the street), we are so lucky!

We decided to go with a puppy rescue here in CO that rescues pups from high kill shelters in TX and NM. Our girl, Lola, came from NM. She's a 13 week old shepherd mix.. we believe she may be a shepherd/lab mix. Man, she is perfect! No accidents so far (we are fully expecting some) and has already learned the word ""sit"". She isn't aggressive with our cat, mostly curious. Our cat, Lucy, hissed once and now they can at least both sleep in the same room so long as Lola is in the crate. They sit and look at each other a lot, but no barking or hissing. I don't know if they will grow to be friends or just kind of co-exist. As long as it's a peaceful existence I'm good.

Our biggest worry was getting our cat (original #1baby) used to a dog and making sure the dog wouldn't be aggressive. So far so good! We are continuing to encourage them to interact and provide love and treats to both when they behave. I would love any tips on this if you have some! Our cat is 4 and is used to being an ""only child"", so I'm really proud of her so far for being so cautious and curious rather than scared or mean. We have a baby gate with a cat door so that Lucy can go upstairs to have some space from the dog if needed. We don't plan on leaving the dog unsupervised on the first floor until she is much older (6-12 months depending on how she does with a little freedom).

My husband has this entire week off of work to acclimate the pup, help with a routine and schedule, and get a vet appt in.

She's sleeping now on her memory foam bed with her toys all around her. It breaks my heart to know this is probably the most comfortable she has been in a while.

Basically, I'm in love!

We genuinely felt called to this dog for a variety of reasons, so the 14 total hours on the road, the airbnb, finding the space for her in our home, the extra costs for her condition, it all seemed worth it. 

Let me interject by saying I know that in a couple months, everything will be okay. I know we are in a transition period. But man, it‚Äôs a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. 

We have another dog, who is truly my best friend. Everyone has that ONE dog that stands out among the rest, the one they‚Äôll remember forever. Arya is that dog for me. I truly believe I can never have another dog that I connect with like I do her. She is just it for me. That being said, she is super dog friendly and did well enough with the introduction, so we drove new dog home. 

The place we rescued her from listed her as only 66lbs &amp; medium levels for energy. This was perfect bc Arya is 56lbs and mid level energy as well. But what the rescue didn‚Äôt mention, is that due to new dog‚Äôs medical condition (EPI) her ideal weight is closer to 75-80lbs. This dog is HUGE. Which would be fine, but she plays very rough. And Arya usually plays semi-rough, but now this new huge dog is overwhelming her. She goes from having a good time to a terrible one pretty quick. 

I broke down today because I feel like we made the wrong call on adopting this dog. She‚Äôs so much overbearing than how they described her. If I had known all of this, we wouldn‚Äôt have made the call on adopting her. 

Aside from Arya, I would be overjoyed to give this dog a home. She is so beautiful and I‚Äôm happy to pay the price of her medications and take all the steps with her. If I didn‚Äôt have Arya, I would be obsessed. Now I‚Äôm just worried that Arya won‚Äôt acclimate well or we made the decision bringing this dog into our home. 

I know when we first adopted Arya it took a while to adjust, and I know I didn‚Äôt feel THIS connected to her until 6-8 months in. And I know it‚Äôll get better and the dogs will acclimate to each other.. but I still feel so much anxiety and I‚Äôm so upset about how things are going.

118,"[Help] puppy vomiting, eye &amp; nasal discharge",dogs,t3_aba2vw,8,False,False,aba2vw,"My girlfriend and I have a puppy (Ellie) who is celebrating her four month birthday today. We got her about a month and a half ago as a companion for our older dog(Maggie), who turns two years old on January 7th. Ellie has not finished her entire round of puppy boosters, her final dosage is scheduled for Wednesday, January 2nd (two days from now). About two days ago Ellie began having eye discharge which persists throughout the day, and yesterday we noticed she had a runny nose.

This morning Ellie ate normally and was playful as normal. She pooped and I noticed it seemed to be a little larger than normal, slightly more firm, and slightly darker. The only change to her diet has been a cod skin treat that she got yesterday and the day before, and denti-sticks that we added three days ago. I thought absolutely nothing of the poop, it seemed within the normal realm of variation for her poop types. Yeah, I pay close attention to her poop cause I‚Äôm a paranoid puppy daddy. This morning it was dark and I didn‚Äôt specifically look for blood or anything, so didn‚Äôt note anything.

At around 9 am my girlfriend texted me and said Ellie had thrown up twice, losing all her food. My girlfriend fed her again and then Ellie vomited again. We haven‚Äôt fed her after that. I‚Äôm home now and Ellie seems a little less energetic than normal but at time of writing she‚Äôs up and about playing with her big sister and my girlfriend.

Background:

She always plays hard and sleeps harder, and she‚Äôll normally spend the majority of her time napping from about 8 am-1pm, unless we interrupt her nap with a trip to the nearby park. The park isn‚Äôt a dog specific park, but it‚Äôs a large, open area where people take their dogs off the leash and let them roam and run. We always pick her up when other dogs come up to us and I‚Äôm very vigilant with her when she‚Äôs on the ground regarding poop and garbage so she doesn‚Äôt eat it. She‚Äôs eaten poop before which caused some concern but not in the past week or so, and we always catch her in the act and remove it from her mouth. 

I went to the SPCA (where she‚Äôs scheduled for last round of boosters on Wednesday) in person and explained the situation, they were unable to offer much assistance given that it‚Äôs a holiday. Our normal vet is also closed. 

Pending actual vet input regarding her symptoms our current course of action is to:

-watch her closely
-check her temperature every hour(currently it‚Äôs 101.6)
-ensure she drinks water continuously
-ensure her play with the older dog is not overly vigorous
-take frequent, light walks to ensure she urinates enough and gets fresh air

If she gets any worse between now and her appointment, or if she develops diarrhea/bloody stool we will take her to an emergency vet immediately.

Is there anything else we should look at or be concerned with?

Do her symptoms give any of you a clue as to what may be wrong? Currently our assumption is that she‚Äôs got some sort of stomach bug, but the concern is that she could be developing distemper or some sort of infection.

120,[fluff] Passive Aggressive Elevator Lady,dogs,t3_ab1d0i,14,False,False,ab1d0i,"Kind of a rant lol. 

Today when my dog and I were coming back from the dog park, we got into the elevator with an older woman. She looked lovingly at my dog and said: 

‚ÄúOh darling, you poor thing! Having to go out in the cold without a coat on! You must be freezing. Poor baby, your mommy needs to buy you a coat so you can bundle up‚Äù 

She didn‚Äôt say a single word to me; she just spoke to my dog. And it‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve had people say/do similar things. Something about having a smaller dog (mini poodle) makes people think my dog NEEDS to be dressed up in sweaters or else he‚Äôll freeze to death. 

For reference, it was 55 degrees today (~13C for my non-American friends). I myself had worn a winter coat to walk to the dog park, and was actually sweating and had to take it off by the time I got there. If I was too hot in a coat, chances are my dog would have also been too hot in a coat - especially because he already has own, natural, built-in coat! Which is very thick and long right now because it‚Äôs winter. And as a poodle, his fur was specifically bred to be dense and warm so that he could swim in icy lakes to retrieve waterfowl. 

And for the record, he HAS a winter coat that ‚Äúmommy‚Äù already bought him, which I don‚Äôt use unless he actually needs it. 

I don‚Äôt know why, but the whole situation just rubbed me the wrong way. Like, first of all, you shouldn‚Äôt be trying to co-parent a stranger‚Äôs dog. Second, if you think my dog is being mistreated or abused, you need to tell me directly instead of passive aggressively talking to my dog instead of me. "

He's normally a very stubborn and high-energy dog - under normal circumstances, he can escape from pretty much every attempt to contain him - but for the last couple of weeks he's suddenly been extremely stiff and lethargic. He walks with a funny, stiff gait, trembles violently and seems to have a hard time getting up and lying down. He eats some days, but other days he shows no interest in food. He also seems extremely sensitive to touch - you can usually pet him with no reaction, but sometimes if something touches his face, he starts yelping and making loud shrieking noise, and seems to be in a lot of pain. We live in an area with a lot of ticks, and I think he might have Lyme disease (the other dog tested positive for Lyme last year but has never shown any symptoms). I'm not a vet by any stretch though, so I could be completely off the mark.

We live in an extremely rural, remote area and the soonest we can get him to see a vet is three days from now. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to relieve his discomfort or encourage him to eat? Warm bath? Wet food instead of dry? Is there anything I can give him?"
125,[Help] Harness for a large dog,dogs,t3_ab4xi8,13,False,False,ab4xi8,"I've never used a harness before. My search on Amazon returned a whole bunch of them that had a chest plate not connected by an under chest band to the torso band. I didn't see any other designs/structure. Pictures showed the chest plate at chest level. The two I tried had it up at the base of my dog's neck, like a low lying collar, and not adjustable to be able to drop it lower. They were the right size according to the charts but just not designed properly in my opinion. The torso band was the only place force would have been applied if I had to stop her from a lunge.

I went to an expensive dog store and found an Easy Sport that had a perfectly fitting, wide and low neck to chest strap with an under belly panel attached to the torso strap. It is padded all around so no strap/buckle adjustment part is directly on her skin. However, the belly band part, shortened as much as possible gapped down about four inches below her belly.

The I found a Black Rino on  Amazon that has the chest/back of neck band attached to the torso strap. Easy to make adjustments that fit,  but the adjustable band parts are all in contact with her skin, which gives me pause. Also,I thought that harnesses were supposed to give you more control when necessary without choking the dog like a collar can do.  I feel that having the leash attachment in the middle of the dog's body gives very little control. Does it just feel that way because I am not used to it? 

I'm thinking of having the Easy Sport  torso band adjustments modified by a friend with an industrial sewing machine. I do not think that the Easy Sport will chafe anywhere because of the padding and because all of the banding is wide so it won't cut into the skin.

My dog is a female Cane Corso who has had at least one litter of pups (probably more because I suspect she was used for breeding before being dumped). I don't want anything that would rub on her nipples. She is large and strong.  I want a bit more security than just a collar when I walk her.

Anyone have suggestions?"

Thanks everyone for all the advice :) I had to reschedule with the behaviorist because of the weather but we are going on Tuesday and my boyfriend is coming with me. I agree 100% with all of you that this is entirely his fault. I think I was so upset and panicked because it was shocking and scary at first but I've calmed down now and I'm more so angry at my boyfriend at this point. At first he was trying to defend himself and say that he's wrestled with him and picked him up like that multiple times and has never gotten a negative reaction which is true but there were two times that I did it and he growled at me so it's really no excuse. I told him from day one that the dog was sensitive about his underarm/shoulder area based on his reaction with me. After awhile he calmed down and isn't acting defensive anymore. Now he feels awful about what happened and guilty. He's on board with everything I'm doing. I think the primary reason I want to go to a behaviorist is so that my boyfriend can hear what he has to say. I know this behaviorist personally because I used to work at a rescue and he would take dogs there and work with them for free so I know he'll come and give good advice. I sat him down and told him that he needs to listen to me now about rules with the dog and he understands now. He completely deserved what he got and I think it's a lesson learned for him.

Luckily, there's no actual bite history paper trail because my boyfriend was already on antibiotics for an unrelated injury and stitches are not needed for the wound. I'm not sure if it's a law in every state but where I'm at nurses and doctors will actually refuse to treat you and won't even look at your injury unless you report the dog or cat that bit you so that was definitely a concern but right now it isn't a problem. So overall things turned out alright. As long as he now respects everything I say and listens to me about it I think things will be ok with us. My dog will be ok too :) He's a good boy and my number 1. If it came down to it, I'd pick him over my boyfriend any day."

She is in a litter of 5 other puppies and 4 of them are a bit bigger than her. I saw her parents too which seemed healthy and over 5 lbs now.

Since I live in a 2 room apartment* I was thinking a small/Mid dog that doesn't require too much space, which made me think of ""my"" dog from when I was a child. Thing is, the people we got him from stated that he was was a Tibetan Spaniel/Papillon mix, but searching for that online gives me pretty longhaired and kinda short legged ones while he was shorthaired and somewhat athletic.

Unless the person has been at our home multiple times and interacting with the dog a lot he will bark up a storm and back up when they try to touch him. It will take him a few minutes to warm up to new people especially men. He is fine with mostly anyone after a while but the initial reaction is fear.

Recently we had family staying at our house for the first time. And Nox was so much better with them from the start. It has been the same with my family as well as my husbands family. We had two roommates in the house for about 8 days and at the end the dog would still bark when they entered the house or woke up in the morning. Not so with anyone of our family ever and we had three separate visits in the last 3 months. He is still the same with non relatives so he hasn‚Äôt changed in general. He lets them cuddle him and listens to them, he only barks when he hears them enter the porch and stops immediately when he sees them. Like he would with us. He was just immediately relaxed around them. 

My guess is either their smell or our reaction to them. But I would think we are equally relaxed around best friends we see a lot more often than family we see once a year and that he has never met before. 

Anyone had similar experiences?

141,[Help] My family supported a backyard breeder,dogs,t3_ab36en,24,False,False,ab36en," I am 17, I have wanted a dog my whole life. Now that my siblings are old enough to also share the responsibility of a dog, my parents decided that this was the right time for us to get a dog. Initially, I was overjoyed. My dad wanted a puppy so that we could have the experience of raising a baby dog, and forming a close bond with it. So our initial look was at shelters. Any puppy we saw was either afraid or apprehensive (my parents wanted a friendly, energetic dog that was happy go lucky off the bat) or was already being snatched up.

Our second look was breeders. My parents were unwilling to spend more than $1000 on a dog, so that quickly ruled breeders out of the question since well-bred pups usually cost upwards of that (and for good reason!).

So at that point we should have stopped looking, but my parents were pretty desperate for a puppy at this point. They turned to Craigslist and saw an adorable litter of Golden Retriever puppies at $700/ea. The ad also showed a healthy adult dog that was supposed to be the mom. I tried to talk them out of it but they made an appointment with the woman anyway. She said she had one puppy left, a male.

I told them that this puppy could have any number of hidden health or behavioral issues and they seemed to be considering this in the car ride to the parking lot this woman offered to meet us in. But when she brought the puppy out, all bets were off. He was so adorable and friendly, sniffing and sitting at our feet and chasing us around. The woman said he was ""8 weeks old"" and provided some proof of him having been vaccinated and dewormed. She said that her friend who owned an English cream retriever had studded her own Red golden retriever and this puppy was one of the products. She offered to take us to a park and let us play with him.

I admit at this point I really wanted to just adopt this little guy. So on the way to the park I didn't say anything. At the park, the pup sealed the deal. He was so outgoing and lovely. The woman really pushed the sale: saying that she had other people who wanted to see him, etc. We brought him home for $550. He has no AKC papers or anything to prove his pedigree.

After a few days having had him, he is a bundle of joy. He loves people, and doesn't have any discernible behavioral issues. He has coccidia, but that is a common puppy disease. He is mostly well behaved. But I'm beginning to sense that this woman was dishonest with us. He looks much closer to 5 or 6 weeks than the 8 weeks we were told-- he barely has the bite strength to break solid kibble. He also might not be a purebred Golden Retriever-- he carries his tail curled and has small ears and an... unconventional muzzle for his breed. Either he is not purebred or he just isn't well-bred. Either is likely.

I don't know what to think. I can't stomach the idea that this puppy might have huge health issues (like hip dysplasia and joint issues) later on in his life and will have to suffer as a consequence of our actions... how can I confront this?

142,[Help] Biting legs and going insane on the street crossing?,dogs,t3_ab64e5,3,False,False,ab64e5,"For context - my dog is an almost 7 months old border collie pup. Usually she's sweet, has some issues with scavenging and guarding whatever she finds, but that's something we have an idea on how to work on. She does well with leash, rarely pulls, can walk off leash as well around nearby meadows or woods. Does really well with training too.

The problems start when I'm walking with her around the university near my home - the area has a lot of grass, trees, a small park, lot of space for a dog - that's on the other side of a quite busy street. Blue is used to cars and public transport, it doesn't bother her. She waits for a green light like a little fluffy angel. When we start walking across, it happens around 80% of time, for no reason apparently, it feels so random - she starts growling and nipping/biting my legs, it used to be just ankles, but today she's even bit my knee. It's never enough to draw blood, but it hurts, gets up stuck on the crossing and is just... embarrassing.

I can't think of any reason for such behavior, we've been training her to cross the street with our usual wait/go commands she reacts to. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific, I don't know why it happens only on the crossings... Will be grateful for any ideas and possible solutions. Leave/calm/don't which we use when she wants to grab something or becomes ""crazy"" don't work."
143,[help] I'm so fed up with my sister who refuses to take care of her (now my) dogs,dogs,t3_aaxya3,15,False,False,aaxya3,"To make a very long story short, my sister (12, f) got a morkie last year. Then, she got 2 other puppies (yorkie and a chihuahua mix). She eventually grew to resent the first dog because it didn't seem to love her as much as it loved me. Though she liked the second dog, she wanted a white dog and made my mom's life very difficult in order to get what she wanted. Even after getting what she wanted, my sister was still unsatisfied and eventually grew bored/lazy of them.

I (20, f), who still lives home with her and our mom, had to take care of all 3 of them. My sister helped out a bit at first, but like I said, she eventually grew disinterested because it was too much work for her. We had to rehome the 3rd one early in May for various reasons and it was one of the best decisions I ever made for both myself and the poor dog.

The other 2 are sweet. I've tried my best to make sure their needs are being met, but as a full-time student who also works and whose mental health is fragile and overall poor, I am so tired of doing all the work and having no support whatsoever.

From the very beginning I thought having dogs was a bad idea, but my impulsive mother was like, hey, don't worry about it, I'll pay for their bills, yadda yadda yadda. I don't resent her for thinking that owning a dog, let alone 2, would be a piece of cake. I just resent how she enables my spoiled sister's behaviors. I am now the sole dog owner because, quite frankly, that title no longer applies to my sister anymore.

I always walk them (though I will admit where I had some days where I couldn't and it's actually getting harder to do so in the winter, but I'm really trying). On the days I go to school they go to a dogsitter's house. I always make sure they have fresh water and food to eat. I tried potty training them in the early days of getting them, but have just stuck with using potty pads. They also pee/poop outside.

I make sure they're up to date with their shots and are in good health. I love them and can't imagine my life without them. But it's hard, you know? Sometimes, I'd feel guilty for thinking that I wished they could morph into one dog so it'd take less work.

I've had to sit my sister down and talk about her selfishness, but it's hard to lecture at a twelve year old who's been coddled for almost her entire life and just has no sense of responsibility. She's super manipulative too, knowing fully well that our mom would defend her. Whenever I ask my sister to help walk the dogs, our mom always says something like, oh no, she can't because of the weather. If it's too hot, she might get mosquito bites (though, to be fair, my sister does have a rare allergy to certain mosquitos), If it's too cold, she'll get a cold. UGH. Even today, I was feeling under the weather and asked my sister to walk them for a bit. She ended up calling our mom, who called me to say that my sister couldn't. So I did.

None of this is fair. I turn to Reddit because my mom doesn't know how to put her foot down and my sister continues to be neglectful (and guess what, she has a bunny and a pet hamster now! and she takes care of them because they're more low-maintenance than dogs). This post started out as a rant, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do. My happiness matters too, right?

144,"[Help] My best friend was previously a stray, and I don‚Äôt know how to break her ‚Äústray‚Äù behavior.",dogs,t3_ab3sk4,0,False,False,ab3sk4,"I‚Äôve (25F) had the dog for almost a year now, she‚Äôs two years this month. Birdy is a Kelpie x Pitbull mix, and was a stray in a state with mostly kill shelters. She is the most affectionate, goofy, kind of ditzy dog - and our other dog is her best friend (we raised our other dog from a puppy onwards). Birdy loves other dogs, new people, but she has some behaviors I can only think is due to her history. 

1) She cannot be restrained without high anxiety. 
Ex) She‚Äôs kennel trained but can‚Äôt be in the crate without our other dog to calm her. If you cuddle her too tightly she grunts and removes herself. If you put her on a leash/harness she becomes unfocused, hyperactive, and pulls like she‚Äôs trying to get off the leash. 

2) This ties into the first one - when on a leash she does a high pitched screaming. It honestly sounds like a velociraptor. She gets so excited she gets the tippy taps, wags her tail, but she also screams - particularly when she sees other dogs. Off leash she does not scream. It terrifies other dog owners as they think it‚Äôs an aggressive behavior, although it‚Äôs been proven it is not. 

3) She scarfs her food so fast and scrounges for any and all food scraps. She licks the furniture, tables, cabinets, floors, gets into any trash no matter how secure (she‚Äôs opened cabinets and locked lids). When she eats every 10-12 hours she chokes on her food. We got a puzzle bowl that helps a lot but she still eats it in record time. 

I just want my best friend to be less anxious and for others to see how wonderful she is, but these behaviors scare new people. "
145,[Help] My dog keeps attacking my girlfriend's dog,dogs,t3_ab1wyu,1,False,False,ab1wyu,"Ok,  so some background information. My girlfriend and I have been together for 10 months now and we are very close to moving in together. We both love our own dogs as well as each other's dogs very much. We try to show equal attention and affection to all three dogs whenever we can. I have a female ~8 yr old dachshund-boxer mix (Casey), and she has two dogs, a male ~8 yr old retriever mix (Hank) and a male ~11 yr old Pit-Lab mix (Lou). The two younger dogs (Casey and Hank) are both very loving and playful dogs, and will play fight all the time. Lou, being the oldest of the group, is much more reserved, but very sweet and has gravitated towards me. I work long days sometimes and Casey has been staying at my girlfriend's house for quite some time now with no issues until recently.

So Casey has attacked Lou three times now and I've become incensed with the situation so I'm looking for help and some answers. The first time it happened, we had just given Lou a bath, and we were showing him love and excitement and apparently that riled Casey up to the point where she attempted to mount Lou from behind (size difference not withstanding). It all happened so quickly, so it's difficult to know what really happened, but apparently when Lou shrugged Casey off, she went for the neck and he was overpowered and lay on his back attempting to fight her off. We managed to separate the two of them before any damage occurred, but Lou was shaken up for a bit. He's a nervous dog regardless, thunderstorms and loud noises bother him, but for this fight he was shaking for a good 10-15 minutes. 

The second time she attacked him, they were outside and my girlfriend and I heard Lou's yelping. Again, no damage occurred, but she did not respond to verbal commands, and I had to separate them physically. 

Finally, the third time this happened occurred last night. My girlfriend and I were in the middle of some... extracurricular activities that involved a lot of agreeing with each other. We occasionally tend to get a little rough with each other and last night was no exception. Suddenly we heard Lou's yelping, and I had to separate them yet again. 

Casey has never truly been an aggressive dog. She has nipped at my kids on occasion when they've grabbed her tail, and I'll sometimes joke that she's ""in heat"" even though she's been neutered, because she'll try to hump my legs on occasion. But I truly don't believe her to be an aggressive dog. 

Lou is even farther from what you would call an aggressive dog. He's just one of those once-in-a-lifetime dogs with the soul of a saint. Which makes this fighting they've been doing even more puzzling. 

My girlfriend and I are just looking for some answers to her behavior and what, if anything, we can do to prevent it."

151,[Discussion] A tribute to Chloe.,dogs,t3_ab5j72,5,False,False,ab5j72,"Hey everyone. First off let me appoligize. I am posting this via phone. Laptop is in the shop. And I really wanted to do this for a new friend tonight. 

I was spending a great Sunday night just browsing through sub reddits. I thought I would find a new group for Kik to join. I had the pleasure of meeting someone new. Her name is Kelsey. Kelsey allowed me to join her Kik group and was very sweet and welcoming.  We got to talking chatting, and we started to open up. She felt comfortable enough to share some news with me. After showing my dog to Kelsey. She began to tell me some horrible news.

 (I may get some get some details messed up. I appoligize in advance Kelsey.)

Kelsey has a 5 year old beautiful boxer named Chloe. She explained that Chloe has been having a ton of issues the prior week. For some reason. Chloe ingested something and is not able to pass the object. They tried everything they could. Until they took Chloe to vet. The vet gave her something to to try to also pass that object. After some odd days Chloe still hasn't been able to pass this object still. She hasn't been able to eat or drink for the whole week. Kelsey was told by the vet that the best thing to do for her pup was to put her down. Kelsey almost had me in tears. A 5 year old pup, that she loves and adores has to go way to early right before the new year on a stroke of bad luck. I felt her hurting even though we are miles apart.

She sent me a pic of her boxer. I broke out in tears. Her dog is a spitting image of my boxer who I lost before I got my new dog Thomas. I couldn't believe it. I honestly thought I was staring at Ginger. It blew my mind. Then and there I wanted to do something nice for Kelsey. But I just didn't know what. Time is short. She's putting down Chloe tomorrow. And I want her to have something that shows we are right there with both of them.

Reddit dinged in my head. Kelsey doesn't have Reddit. (Well not yet.) But I wanted her to see the love and support of the community and how things like like this happen for a reason. And with new friends and new experiences, it may be a tough ride but she has support.

So to my new friend Kelsey and her beautiful best friend Chloe. This life is over but you guys will never be apart. She's not gonna have to suffer anymore and it's time for her to rest comfortable.
She will always be your bed bud. Your best friend and your most trustworthy soul. 

Everything's gonna be okay.

So, we went out of town for Christmas, dog came with us. He has taken many, many car trips in his life so nothing new there.

So we get back home Tuesday night, everything is normal. Wednesday morning I wake up and start my work day routine.

The really weird part is, if anyone else comes over or I take him somewhere else, he goes back to totally normal behavior again! He‚Äôs also fine at night. At some point in the evening, he finally gives up and goes to sleep for the night. 

He‚Äôs eating, drinking, playing, walking, pooping, peeing, and isn‚Äôt hurt anywhere.

153,Dog bit my boyfriend [Help],dogs,t3_aavg83,52,False,False,aavg83,"So last night our dog (6 or 7-year-old male Mastiff) was laying on the floor and my boyfriend went to get him up to take him up to bathe him. My boyfriend grabbed him underneath his front legs and tried to tug him up. I‚Äôve told him multiple times that this bothers the dog because he‚Äôs shown signs like growling in the past to indicate he doesn‚Äôt like being grabbed this way. He also has arthritis in his front legs which causes him discomfort. My boyfriend has never listened to me about this and likes to try and get my dog up this way. So this time the dog snarled and bit him in the face. My boyfriend is fine, he‚Äôs on antibiotics and has a bruised eye and a torn part of his ear. I‚Äôd say it was a level 3 dog bite as our dog reacted and got him once and then ran away scared instead of hanging on or going back for more.

However, I‚Äôm very worried about what I‚Äôm going to do about it. I‚Äôm meeting with a behavioralist and trainer today that I called immediately after it happened. I also have a vet appointment to assess his legs and consider other medication options for his arthritis. My boyfriend is acting like this isn‚Äôt a big deal and is taking the blame for grabbing the dog like that because I have told him endlessly to not do it because he‚Äôs shown signs that it causes him discomfort. The rule is now nobody can touch him In that way or pull on his shoulders and hopefully the behavioralist can help in some way or enlighten us a little bit about the situation. I feel like nobody around me is thinking this is a big deal (my boyfriend, my boyfriends parents, my mom, etc.) but I feel extremely upset and like maybe I should make a big deal about it. Am I responding in the right way? Should I be doing anything more? 

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs important to note but we just got back from a trip which we took him on. It was an 18 hour car ride and our dog was already irritated because of this.

156,Eating Food Your Dog Licked [Discussion],dogs,t3_ab3fbd,3,False,False,ab3fbd,"My dog stuck his face in my chicken caesar salad and licked around a little, but I just went ahead and ate it anyway.

In retrospect I'm a bit concerned about bacterium and zoonotic diseases (thanks google).

I guess I'm looking for anecdotes about eating stuff your dog has licked and whether you got sick or not. It seems plenty of owners share food (like ice cream etc.) with their dogs or let them lick their spoon, or even let them lick in their mouths and are fine, but it also seems theres some pretty creepy stuff they can carry around.

157,[breeds] what are some good breeds for us?,dogs,t3_ab4zfd,0,False,False,ab4zfd,"Introduction

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, have a bc mix. My parents bred field golden retrievers most of my life and have always said a house is not a home without a dog. I helped train these dogs and it was one of my chores to take care of the puppies. My husband was raised with rescue Great Danes and Mastiffs. So lots of big dog experience but no experience with small dogs.

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a¬†reputable breeder?

Will try breed specific rescues then breeder if necessary

Describe your ideal dog.

Affectionate, gregarious, confident, biddable, athletic (ie not braciphalic), good to go everywhere including fairs, hiking trails, dog park and resturants. Husband wants a dog that he can either pet while standing or he can pick up to pet.

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Yorkshire terrier: my mom has one that is super cool and lovable but he isn't good with kids and strange dogs so I worry this breed won't work.

Border terrier: sounds a lot like Yorkies but bred to be more dog friendly. Worried about being too stubborn.

Papillons and havanese: cute little dogs that seem smart enough but worried about being too barky.

Greyhounds: they are tall enough for my husband to pet without bending down but isn't giant. They seem chill in the house, affectionate, but also athletic. Problem being we'd prefer a rescue and they usually demand a fenced in yard. Also worry they'd escape a dog park.

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I would really like to do agility and/or obiedence competitions

Care Commitments

How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Currently we do daily 15 minute training sessions and 2 walks. In the winter the walks are 30 minutes long and in the summer they are 1 hour. I'd be willing to increase these time commitments. When our dog was a puppy I use to do 3x 5-15 minute training sessions.

During the weekends we normally go for hikes or outings. Hikes can be anywhere from 5 miles to 20. Outings include dog friendly festivals.

How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Winters we go on 2x 30 minute walks due to our dog's fear of darkness and being wet. Summers it's 2x 1 hour walks that includes going to a fenced in off-leash dog park (it's the only park within walking distance).

How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We currently brush our dog out 3x a week and do biweekly baths. I'd be willing to add another dog on this mix or start taking them to a groomer.

Personal Preferences

What size dog are you looking for?

Perferably small (less than 30 lbs) for easy apartment finding but it's not a necessity

How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding is fine (our current dog is crazy). Barking is a no because we live in an apartment. Slobber is fine.

How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not at all. Everywhere we go there's leash laws and our current dog is a runner so we are use to being leash constrained.

Dog Personality and Behavior

Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly would be nice. We definitelywant an affectionate dog. Open to have either a dog that just want to hang with us on the couch or a stage 10 clinger, but don't want a super independent dog.

Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

Prefer eager to please

How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Alert bark but greet them happily. Want them to happily greet people preferably without jumping on them.

Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

Lifestyle

How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

8 hours a day

What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

We both split caring for the dogs equally but it's just me and the hubby.

Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

Just another dog. No plans for any other animals but dogs.

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, we regularly baby sit friends kids and we see kids during outings.

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We plan to rent for the foreseeable future. Currently lease restrictions is under 120lbs, no German Shepherds, huskies, ""pit bulls"", great Danes, saint Bernards, or Mastiffs

What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Nope.

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

It's the PNW so 80s and clear in the summer, 40s and rainy in the winter.

Need advice on introducing her to our 2 year old, female Siamese cat.",dogs,t3_aaxfgg,12,False,False,aaxfgg,"Title explains the situation. My wife and I rescued the Shepard in NC. We're driving back to our home in Ohio with the dog right now. My wife is worried that they won't get along and introducing the dog into our cat's life will change the cat's affectionate, playful personality. We've done our research and are confident in being able to train the dog how we want. The dog will stay in the crate for at least the first few weeks and we plan on gradually introducing them. Our cat has never shown aggression or dominant behavior, overall she's pretty chill. In the short time we've had the dog, she has been listening well. She is pretty active and excites easily but she's never had a big backyard to play in and run around like we have. Plus she's not fixed yet (that will be done very soon). Those factors combined with being moved multiple times in the past week I would think can excite any animal.



I know it'll take time to get them acquainted and we'll have to work with both of them. I keep telling my wife this but she's worried nonetheless. Any advice, methods, and/or tips on making this process easier would be greatly appreciated."

160,[Help] Dog is weird about eating kibble,dogs,t3_ab2yj4,17,False,False,ab2yj4,"I've had my dog for about a year now and for about 8 months she's been weird about her kibble. When we first got her she loved her kibble-- we used to put it in a treat ball so she would eat it slower. Then about 4 months in she stopped liking her kibble.

What we've been doing for awhile now is leaving the kibble out so she can eat it when she feels like it. Strangely the only time she'll touch the kibble is in the middle of the night. She usually eats half the bowl, which is about half a cup (she's 30lbs and used to eat 1 1/2 cups a day, but back then she was skinny and needed to gain weight). Sometimes she won't touch her food at all. There have been a few instances where she doesn't touch her food for a few days, so I hand feed her to her and she eats the whole bowl.

Lately I've been adding a raw egg to her food at night-- the past two nights she wolfed down the whole bowl. Tonight she won't touch it. If I try to feed it to her she shies away and gets super submissive, putting her head down a wagging her tail. I think she can feel that I'm frustrated so I've given up on that.

Other than that she gets a few spoonfuls of wet food in the morning, a dental stick, and treats throughout the day. She gets high value treats (cheese, beef liver, etc) every day because she's reactive and we need them to train her. We've brought this up to two vets, one said ""she'll eat when she's hungry"" and the other said to try a different kibble (which we did, she did the thing where she ate it for two days and then only ate it intermittently)

All in all, not sure if I should be concerned or if she is just being picky. Half a cup of food a day doesn't seem like enough to me, but the food is there for her if she's hungry.

TL;DR Dog will only sometimes eat her kibble, not sure if I should be concerned / try to fix this or leave it be

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: One follow up question-- if she is potentially just getting full off of treats, is that problematic? She does eat a lot of cheese, beef liver, milk bones, and other homemade treats. Probably over thinking this but just want to be sure :)

161,[Help] My 11 year old maltese x shitzu over exerted himself by chasing a younger dog at the park and now he is limping ans having trouble moving.,dogs,t3_ab1owh,3,False,False,ab1owh,"I was walking my dog and there were a few dogs at the off leash area of the park. He sniffed this young 1 year old whippet/terrier looking dog, who looked very lean and fast and they decided to chase each other. My dog is somewhat stubborn and I could see he was determined to catch the younger dog even though he has little chance. I could see him running quite alot and when they finally stopped he sat down panting and I could see his little back legs shaking.

I gave him some time to recover and then tried to get him to keep walking. He was struggling and now he was limping off his front paw. I had to carry him to the water and he drank, walked a little but was struggling and sat back down. I carried him home and have been monitoring him.

He ate all his meal (I carried him to the food but he limped back to his spot). He's moving a little but still limping and having trouble moving. It's been just over two hours now.

Should I be concerned? Is this normal that dogs over exert themselves?

Since he is an elderly dog (11 years old) I'm a little worried. Honestly it was nice that he ran around and I could see this youthful exuberance in him, but not at the expense of an injury or hurting himself.

Afterwards, he was a little shaky but basically fine. Was walking around, hopping around, and licking faces.  Was very offended when I took him outside on a leash instead of letting him run around the yard. He‚Äôs basically just fine now, completely normal.

He had his first seizure a little over two years ago; it was much worse. He lost much of his sight and hearing and took awhile to get back to his normal self.

We‚Äôre taking him into the vet tomorrow morning, but what in general causes seizures in senior doggies? Should I worry? We‚Äôre supposed to go out of town next week; should I stay behind to watch him? Can he still have a good quality of life if seizures are a part of it?

Thanks in advance. "

168,Getting rid of dog smell from house... [help],dogs,t3_aaymk8,15,False,False,aaymk8,"Looking for some suggestions as to how I can minimize or eradicate the dog smell from our living room.  


I have two dogs - purebred APBT, and a German Shepherd. Their beds (just bought at the beginning of December) are in our living room as well as their water bowl. I have an airwick air freshener plug-in going 24/7 on a high setting but there is a constant smell of dog in the living room and on our couch (hence why we bought them beds). The dogs get a bath once every 2 weeks in EarthBath puppy shampoo and EarthBath oatmeal conditioner. Then they have a wet-wipe down the other week with an EarthBath puppy wipe. I have washed their beds already since we got them and plan to do so every 2 weeks to hopefully decrease the lingering smell on their beds. They have stopped coming on the couch since they got their own beds...  


I'm wondering if anybody has any suggestions as to how to get rid of or reduce the smell in the living room and on the (fabric) couch?

171,[Help] Neighbor lets dog run around unleashed and said dog chases roommates and my dog,dogs,t3_ab0jld,8,False,False,ab0jld,"Basically what the title says. I recently moved in with a couple of friends and we‚Äôre renting a house while we‚Äôre in school. We only talk to the neighbors right next to us and they‚Äôre nice, but our neighbors across the street are the source of the problem. They have two little dogs that they let run around out in our cul de sac all the time unsupervised and not on leashes. We have problems with one of the dogs that‚Äôs an ankle biter who chases us up to our front door and generally goes onto the house property (one time I saw him in our backyard after he slipped through the fence bars). We‚Äôve usually ignored the dog but he had harassed not only us but my roommates girlfriend when she comes over.

Today was kind of my final straw point. I was out walking my dog and as I was walking back up to our house the little dog ran up to my dog and tried attacking him. Now my dog is a big 7 year old GSD mix that easily has 50+ pounds on the other dog, so I wasn‚Äôt really worried about the other dog hurting him.  But still it‚Äôs completely irresponsible to let your dog do that. Luckily the kids of our neighbor were out and managed to call the dog back before I had to forcibly get the dog away. I plan on talking to them the next time I see them and let them know what their dog is doing and let them know I will call animal control if the problem isn‚Äôt corrected. Is this an appropriate response? I‚Äôm going to give them a warning and notify them, and then if the issue still isn‚Äôt corrected I‚Äôll call animal control. 

I‚Äôm wondering if this is a valid course of action to take? Am I allowed to call animal control if the dog continues trying to attack our houses residents and guests?

I have a lot of ideas for breed suitability but looking for insight from those with more experience with suitable breeds on what could be a good fit for me.  This is my first ever Reddit post so if there are any mistakes (e.g. formatting), that's why.  It was dictated to my American SO, hence the American spellings, if anyone was curious.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

*1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?*

First dog, grew up with nan‚Äôs red setters and a mix breed that I did a little training with. My mum had a Rottweiler until recently that I got to see/play with and do minimal training with when visiting. Partner has experience training obedience, trick work and distraction proofing, volunteer assisted at a training facility and was at one point registered as a therapy team with her Papillon. I know birds aren‚Äôt the same as dogs but I do also have experience training birds.

&amp;#x200B;

*2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a* [*reputable breeder*](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)*?*

I have a slight preference for going through a reputable breeder, ONLY IF the breeder is offering an unfixed male, due to the behavioral/physiological impact of neutering. However, I would be happy with any dog, rescue or otherwise, that could perform the tasks I need it to.

&amp;#x200B;

*3. Describe your ideal dog.*

Active, requiring at least around 2 hours a day of exercise (my tentative plan is a 1 hour run + obedience training in the morning, 1 hour of hands-on training e.g. agility/retrieving in the afternoon, and 1 hour plus or minus of light/moderate flexible exercise in the evening), robust/rough-and-tumble (something I can potentially roughhouse with/don‚Äôt have to worry about being gentle with), minimal breed health problems (I don‚Äôt want the health of the dog to be a concern I have to manage from birth to death), attentive but not anxious, emotionally robust, fairly calm (not easily excitable), a closely-bonded (ideally one-person dog) partner.

&amp;#x200B;

*4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?*

I‚Äôm open to any breed as the important part is that it‚Äôs fit for purpose, but these are the breeds I‚Äôve looked at:

* *New Zealand Huntaway* \- The dog I‚Äôm most curious about/interested in right now. I think a herding breed would be good at the tasks I need it to perform and I like that it‚Äôs pure working stock.
* *Standard Poodle* ‚Äì Intelligent, trainable, and athletic. I‚Äôm concerned they may be too emotionally sensitive and about the potential for health issues but am optimistic about their potential.
* *Airedale Terrier* \- Suggested below.  Concerned about stubbornness/trainability for a first time owner.
* *~~Malinois~~* ~~‚Äì I understand they have good drive, high energy levels, good biddability, and good health, but I am not sure these are the right way to go for me due to being so ‚Äòtightly wound.‚Äô~~ Decided these are a definite 'no'.
* *Kelpie* ‚Äì Again, great working ability that I feel could be redirected for the tasks I need. Good energy levels, etc. Maybe a little small.
* *Australian Cattle Dog (working)* \- My favorite breed for years both aesthetically and in temperament, but for my needs I think they are too small and it is hard to find a relatively local breeder that doesn‚Äôt have very bullyish looking ACDs. If I could find something that was like a large ACD that could be perfect.

The breeds/types I‚Äôm drawn to aesthetically are primitive breeds, moderate working type dogs, lean dogs, and dogs with big teeth (not for any aggression reasons, just aesthetically I like a good smile), however aesthetic preferences will always come second to a dog that‚Äôs fit for purpose ‚Äì I will love it either way.

&amp;#x200B;

*5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?*

Essentially I am looking to self-train a service dog although as I live in the UK it will not be able to be registered as such and will not have the same public access rights as a registered or American service dog (I call it a task dog). I have severe ADHD and problems socializing that do not respond well to medication; as a result, I‚Äôm looking into ways to manage my life off medication. So I am looking for a dog to train to aid me in symptom management and reduction. Some of the tasks I‚Äôve identified are:

* Incentivizing me to both wake up and go to bed (probably by essentially harassing me)
* Finding and getting, particularly meds (for other medical conditions) but also many objects so I don‚Äôt have to be distracted from my work
* Behavioral interruption ‚Äì getting my attention to distract me from itching myself or getting agitated in public (potentially by grabbing my hand in its mouth and holding until released)
* Block/cover ‚Äì moving to stand in front of me and not letting me move, or moving to stand behind me and creating a barrier
* ‚ÄúStick and spot‚Äù ‚Äì physically blocking me from moving away from a location where I need to be (e.g. in the kitchen) until released

I‚Äôd also like to train it normal obedience commands, agility or something like dog parkour (I have done human parkour myself), and some fun tricks, because I have a lot of excess energy to constructively burn.

&amp;#x200B;

**Care Commitments**

*6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*

3 or so hours at least of one-on-one time, always at least an hour and a half of exercise and always at least an hour of obedience. I‚Äôm flexible.

&amp;#x200B;

*7. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?*

Always at least an hour of running a day, and probably at least an hour of additional fetch-type exercise. Potentially more if I‚Äôm not tired out by the exercise we‚Äôre doing. There‚Äôs a large potential the dog will be able to come with me to work even if it isn‚Äôt a registered service dog, however I won‚Äôt know for sure until next summer (I don‚Äôt intend to get a dog until I do know for sure). I intend to take the dog to parks where there will be other dogs, but not ‚Äòdog parks.‚Äô

&amp;#x200B;

*8. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?*

While I prefer a dog with an easily manageable coat, I‚Äôm happy to do basically all grooming at home, including for Poodle-type coats. I‚Äôm a big do-it-yourselfer and routine is important for me too, so incorporating grooming (including cleaning ears, brushing teeth, trimming nails, etc) into the routine could even be beneficial for me. I would be willing to pay a professional to do the things I wasn‚Äôt able to do but I would prefer to learn to do them myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Preferences**

*9. What size dog are you looking for?*

Medium to large ‚Äì it has to be large enough to block me effectively e.g. from crossing roads.

&amp;#x200B;

*10. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?*

Probably low to medium of all of these. I can handle shedding and slobbering and am happy to let a dog express itself by barking (volume doesn‚Äôt bother me), but excessive amounts of any of these would be distracting and thus not helpful for the purpose I need it for. A dog that lets out a big bark or two when it‚Äôs happy is A-OK, but a dog that chain-barks when it gets even a little excited would distract me, so I don‚Äôt want a breed predisposed to this.

&amp;#x200B;

*11. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?*

Important. I want to be able to take my dog to a park off leash and play games with it, as well as go running off leash most days. Additionally I need a high level of trust in my dog so even if it wasn‚Äôt going to be off leash in an unfenced area I would want to be able to trust that it would stay by my side.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

*12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?*

Low to medium snuggly ‚Äì I‚Äôm fine with a dog that likes to snuggle, but I want a dog that isn‚Äôt going to become a distraction (by trying to snuggle constantly) or be unfulfilled/unhappy when I can‚Äôt snuggle it all the time. Ideally I‚Äôd like a dog that was emotionally independent but liked a good scritch.

&amp;#x200B;

*13. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?*

I want a dog that‚Äôs independent enough to perform its tasks without a high degree of emotional encouragement to do them beyond what is received in daily obedience training ‚Äì it has to be self-confident and relatively self-possessed. However as I need a task dog that reliably performs tasks it does need to be attentive and have a good level of reliable obedience/responsibility.

&amp;#x200B;

*14. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?*

I‚Äôd like my dog to alert me to someone knocking on the door because I need an external motivator to prompt me to answer it. I don‚Äôt want my dog to greet strangers or visitors because I don‚Äôt want it to encourage people to interact with it (or me) while it‚Äôs working and I don‚Äôt want visitors or strangers to inadvertently un-train my dog.

&amp;#x200B;

*15. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?*

Generally yes but for my task dog no. It has to be reliable in public even if it doesn‚Äôt have legal access rights.

&amp;#x200B;

*16. Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?*

Begging for food. It is easy enough to train out but I don‚Äôt like it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lifestyle**

*17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?*

Pretty much never. Even if I can‚Äôt bring it to work with me my partner works from home and rarely goes out. I can‚Äôt imagine it being left alone for more than 3 hours at a time and that very rarely if at all.

&amp;#x200B;

*18. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?*

My partner will be helping me train this dog. She prefers small-to-medium, less active dogs for herself but has no trouble with large, active dogs being a part of the household. I‚Äôll be in charge of essentially all aspects of caring for the dog (feeding, walking, grooming, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

*19. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?*

My partner is planning on rescuing a dog suitable for her tastes (small-to-medium, less active, mixed breed) prior to adoption of this dog for me, and we would like to get birds (backyard hens, potentially budgies or doves) and a cat in the future (post adoption of this dog for me).

&amp;#x200B;

*20. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?*

No.

&amp;#x200B;

*21. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?*

Currently we are not allowed any pets (this is all research for 6 months from now when we move!). We will be ensuring the place we move into accepts whatever breed of dog we determine is best.

&amp;#x200B;

*22. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?*

We live in the UK, so no APBT, Tosa Inu, Dogo Argentino, or Fila Brasiliero.

&amp;#x200B;

*23. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?*

According to Google the average is 22-23 C in the summer and 8-9 C in the winter. There‚Äôs days where it goes up to 28ish or down to 0ish, but those aren‚Äôt the average. We get a lot of rain though."

 The last 2 months or so, she crunches down on the wood chips outside sporadically. She always stops when I tell her, but I can't be watching her every second for 10 hours when there's 25 other dogs there. She's started doing it so much that she has trouble pooping the next day. I'm getting worried about what she's doing to her stomach and intestines. 

Other dogs have done this here before; all have either chewed them and spit them out, or we feed them lunch halfway through the day and the behaviour stops. I started feeding her lunch last month, but she still does it. 

She doesn't have destructive behaviours at home - never gets into ripping or chewing anything up - but she's the only dog at home and has space to play with he own toys regularly.

Harley is a bulldog mix we rescued about 2.5 months ago. About 2 weeks after getting her she started throwing up and subsequently having trouble breathing. We did xrays and she was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. She seemed to be fully recovered and completely healthy up until a couple of days ago. We picked her up from boarding/day care and she seemed fine, just a little tired. The next day we noticed she had a little bit of a runny nose and decided to keep am eye on it. That was Friday. Yesterday she still had a runny nose and a slight cough but she was eating/drinking normally and playing with her toys. We thought we'd give it one more day and then take her in. Welp, I wish I hadn't. I was up all night with her because she was struggling to breathe, vomiting and just uncomfortable. Took her to an emergency vet around 2am but they had a 2 hr wait and said she looked stable enough to go home.

As we anticipated, the vet recommended we euthanise her, as there was no other solution that could have made her life easier. Of course, I knew this day would come eventually and had started preparing myself psychologically for her passing, or so I thought. The vet came to our home, to ensure that she would be relaxed in an environment she knows, but saying goodbye must have been the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. She fell asleep forever surrounded by her family, ourselves and our three other dogs.

She was our first dog, my parents got her around the same time I was born and she had been my life companion ever since. Now that she is no longer among us, I feel like a part of me is missing and I don't know how to process the incredible amount of grief I am feeling right now. I am completely aware that she lived life to its fullest and that it as time for her to leave us but I am struggling to let go and cannot fathom how I will keep a straight face tomorrow for New Year's Eve, I've been crying all afternoon.

If some of you have gone through the same, I would love to hear how you got closure and completed your process of grieving. Love to all of you and your beautiful companions."
187,[HELP] How to figure out the right breed for my family?,dogs,t3_aay4dh,4,False,False,aay4dh,"Hi! I‚Äôm new to this sub, so let me know if this post is inappropriate.  
  
I have been a dog owner before, I had a standard sized Dachshund that lived 14 years and passed 5 years ago. Since he was my first dog, I did some mistakes while raising him, but in the end I think he had a happy life.  
  
Now I want very much to have another dog, but I am not sure if my current lifestyle would match a specific breed, or if I shouldn‚Äôt have any dog at all. I am 25, single and not planning to move or get married/have children on the next 7 years.   
  
First of all, I work from 9am to 6pm. I am able to walk the dog for 20 - 30 minutes twice a day (before and after work) and play indoors at night. I‚Äôm just worried about those 9 hours I won‚Äôt be home. We have a maid 3x a week that stays from 9am to 5pm, but she can‚Äôt give a dog full attention and walk him (unless we give her an extra pay for that). I can definitely take the dog to the city‚Äôs parks in the weekends.  
  
My family is not big, I live with my parents (60 y.o.) and a cousin (22 y.o.). My brother (22 y.o.) is there for the weekends, too. We live in a big apartment downtown and we are soon moving to a house with backyard in a quieter area. My parents are retiring soon (mom probably in 2019 or 2020).  
  
Regardless of my lifestyle, my favorites breeds are (a bit random):  
‚Ä¢ Welsh Corgi Pembroke  
‚Ä¢ Shetland Sheepdog  
‚Ä¢ Shiba Inu  
‚Ä¢ Samoyed  
‚Ä¢ Australian Shepherd  
‚Ä¢ Boston Terrier  
‚Ä¢ English Springer Spaniel  
‚Ä¢ French Bulldog  
‚Ä¢ Labrador Retriever  
‚Ä¢ Basset Hound  
‚Ä¢ Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  
‚Ä¢ Irish Setter  
  
We need a dog that is friendly towards people and other dogs, loyal and affectionate - not a lap dog though, it can be a bit more independent. I prefer small or medium sized (although some of my list are bigger). Do you think it‚Äôs feasible to have a dog under those terms or should I wait more for the right moment? What are your thoughts?

Yesterday they spontaneously decided to buy a Labrador puppy from the same person as my sister's friend. It was all of a sudden and I was not prepared for it.   


Since this happened so quickly, I am feeling anxious and panicking. This sudden responsibility to take care of a puppy is not letting me calm down and I am constantly thinking about it. I suggested returning the puppy but the person who sold her to us is refusing to take her back. Don't get me wrong, I like this puppy very much and indeed wanted a dog as well, but not right now. In my mind, I was imagining getting a dog when we had a bigger house with lots of open space. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now we have this cute little Labrador puppy and have zero experience with dogs. I am left with these mixed emotions and have no idea how to deal with them. I ask this community to help and give advice on how to take care of her and how to deal with these feelings.   


Thank you very much. 

Update: I made a decision for the sake of the puppy and gave it to a person who will 100% take care of her and love her. That person has all the space in the house needed for the puppy and the finances to provide good care. I shared all the info you kind people provided me. I would like to thank you all for your help and advice. The puppy is in good hands now. "

I just don‚Äôt want my dog Blu to feel as if he‚Äôs being replaced, but I really want him to have a friend. Should I wait and see how he acts without his best friend in his life?

192,"[Fluff] So Much Personality, And Too Smart For Her Own Good!",dogs,t3_aatlv7,0,False,False,aatlv7," 

I work in a store that allows dogs to come in, as long as they're well behaved and either in the owner's arms at all times, or on a leash.

As I'm ringing up a woman, her dog manages to ninja her leash free of her distracted human, and comes around the counter to say hi.

I am first aware of this by the feel of something warm press against my leg. I look down, and there's this american bulldog mix pressing her side against my thigh, looking back over her shoulder at me, with her tongue hanging sideways out of her mouth. Her tail makes a very noisy 'thwack thwack' noise against the stuff behind the counter; the epitome of doggie language for, ""Hello human, I'm friendly, please pet me?""

I laugh and greet her, and her human is apologetic but I laugh it off and give ""Tasha' a petting, receiving kisses in return.

I ask if she'd be okay with a treat. (We ask because maybe the dog is on a diet, or has food allergies, or anything else that might mean treats aren't allowed.)

When I get the okay, I get a Milkbone out of the box and feed it to the happy hound before leading her back to her owner and finish up the transaction.

Just as her owner turns around to discover that the dog has ninja'd her way free once again... I hear a rummaging sound behind me.

I turn and see that Tasha is a very smart dog. That one box has goodies in it, and she has taken it upon herself to snag two for the road.

&gt;""Tasha!"" her owner scolds.

I'm trying very hard not to laugh hysterically as the dog turns around with the biggest, most innocent, Disney eyes I've ever seen, the ends of two Milkbones sticking out of her muzzle.

&gt;""Me? Steal cookies? Why would you ever think that of me?"" the eyes seem to say.  
&gt;  
&gt;""She's a bit too smart for her own good,"" I say, ""Keep a close eye on this one.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""So I see,"" her owner chuckles, and heads out with the leash firmly in her hand.

I hope her owner does a better job of keeping her dog in hand, but I have to admit, those shenanigans were funny!"

196,[Help] my dog won't sleep alone,dogs,t3_aav3rg,5,False,False,aav3rg,"Hello, 

I've had a rescue dog for almost two years and never had any problems with her, she settled in fine and was never any trouble. 

From the first night she slept downstairs in her bed and stayed there the whole night without any issues. A few months back we all went to bed as normal, however she woke up and started to bark and whine, so I went down and put her back to bed, I went back to bed but she did the same thing again. In the end I slept downstairs with her and she stayed and she stayed in her own bed whilst I slept on the sofa. 

She was fine for a couple of weeks after but then she did the same thing and I slept downstairs again, no issues. She then started doing this more regularly (once or twice a week). There was one time where when I came downstairs and opened the door she darted through and upstairs to my bed. I could not get her out at all. I was extremely poorly and just wanted to sleep so let her stay...I know I'm an idiot! 

After this night I went down and I would put her to bed and go back to bed myself but she'd continuously whine and bark (I must have tried 20 times each night) but eventually I gave up and let her up.

Now, every damn night she'll bark and whine until she's let upstairs to sleep in bed.

Please someone give me some advice!"
197,[Help] How to train a puppy to be polite while off-leash?? Super embarrassing situation yesterday..,dogs,t3_aaya8t,10,False,False,aaya8t,"I have a 4.5 month old mixed breed puppy (40lbs currently) and live very close to a super nice off leash area. It's like a combo walking path/dog area that is completely unfenced and connects to over 100km of trails, so there are dog people as well as joggers/cyclists etc. Now that puppy has all of her shots, I have been taking her out around the neighborhood and yesterday we practiced recall in the off leash area. I plan on taking her out there almost daily as long as weather permits so I really need her to learn to do this well.

The problem is, she loves everyone and right now wants to greet every single dog and person she meets. I don't let  her greet anyone when she's on her leash, but all of the socialization we did before her vaccines were done seems to have accidentally taught her that if she's off-leash she can run up to everyone she sees and go wild. She met friends' adult dogs at our house and theirs (off leash the whole time), and did a 6 week puppy class that was a combination of training on-leash and then taking the leash off and telling her to ""go play"" before letting the puppies run wild and play with each other, in addition to another socialization session with 8-10 puppies once a week. Again, off leash = party time to play and greet other people and dogs.

Which leads us to what happened yesterday. About 5 minutes after I let her off leash (so she still had the puppy crazies), a woman came walking up the path from around the corner and my puppy BOLTED right towards her and didn't hear me calling for her at all. She jumped up on this poor woman and snagged her gloves with her teeth and ripped them while trying to play. After about a million apologies and re-leashing the puppy until we were out of sight of any other people, we continued our walk and she was fine with recall, but it was bad to say the least.

How can we train her to leave other people/dogs alone unless I say it's ok? I am at a loss here, especially when it's an off leash area and I can't control her like I'd be able to on-leash?

I have a 6 year old Shetland Sheepdog/Shihtzu mix. She's been an only dog the whole time, though we visit family with dogs regularly.
I have a 9 month old who just started crawling and naturally wants to touch the dog's toys and food. 
Dog is doing pretty good so far, she takes the toys and runs across the room to  keep them away from the baby, but she does growl when she does it. 
She also growls and eats her food as fast as she can when the baby starts crawling near it. 
She doesn't care about stuffed animals, but higher value treats or treat dispensing toys cause the growling and defensive body language.

What we've done so far:
-We do not yell or scold. I don't want to encourage aggression by being aggressive.
-The dog has her own kennel and couch that are off limits to the baby. 
-we limit the toys out laying around, if she's chewing on one and the baby grabs a different one it stresses dog out.
-I've been giving dog high value treats when the baby is by the food and water bowls, and now she tolerates the baby by the bowls if they are empty.

Dog has never snapped at anyone and I can take even high value treats away without problems. But I really don't like the growling at the baby.  What can I do to help her with the baby? 

I really appreciate the advice!"

My neighborhood is notorious for unleashed dogs just trotting around on the sidewalk while their owners give 0 shits about their own dog's safety or anyone else's. I've had dogs bolt across a busy street, trying to attack my dog. I've had dogs run down an entire block, owner making no effort to catch them, to get closer to my dog. 

Today, I round the corner with my girl and see a small, white, fluff ball with no collar or leash. I shorten my girl's leash and turn right the fuck around - I do not deal with off leash dogs. This woman and her free fluffball round the corner right after us and her dog sees my girl, starts walking towards her, and then the woman looks at my girl, says ""oh. no."" like my dog is a disgusting beast, and proceeds to pick her dog up right in front of my girl's face. Clearly this worked my dog up, and this woman's response was to laugh and give another, ""yeah..no.""

I'm so fed up by how many encounters I have with off leash dogs on a WEEKLY basis. Leash laws exist for a REASON. I don't care if your dog is friendly. I don't care how well trained you think your dog is. I don't care about any reason you think having your dog off leash is okay. Unless you're at a park that permits off leash dogs, PUT A LEASH ON IT. 

Lastly, why is it always the owners of these small breed dogs that do this? I've never seen a Shepherd, Lab, or Pitbull walking around on a sidewalk without a leash. But you bet your ass I've seen plenty of poms, shih tzus, and other fluffy mutts trotting around with nothing attached to them. Someone please tell me why that is - I genuinely don't understand. 

If you're reading this and you got a dog for the holidays - buy a leash and use, I beg you."

My grandmother is the worst human being on the planet because she is so fucking stubborn. I am actively looking forward to her death. Just a preface.

I have a 9 year old Shih Tzu. We got him when he was 2 months old. He's a very energetic dog, super friendly and intelligent, though stubborn himself. My mother and I work full time at different shifts, so for most of the day, the dog is alone with my grandmother. I come home pretty late and therefore wake up late, my mother leaves very early. So let's say from like 10 am to 5pm, the dog is 100% alone with my grandmother. My grandmother feeds him treats and human food only. My dog is almost obese. Anyway. My grandmother was away for 2 weeks and the dog ate his food every day. Every single day. The day she came back, he hasn't touched his bowl. He doesn't care, he's getting fucking treats! I come home from work today, and just now I found three treats on the stairs. Fucking three. On the stairs. And I know she kicks some under her bed, and I know she feeds the dog her food, when she eats (she ""accidentally"" drops stuff on the floor and he eats it). And we don't eat healthy ourselves!

I have told my grandmother to stop. She doesn't. I asked my mother to tell her to stop. I don't think my mother ever really did. And now I am so damn angry and I'm crying every fucking time I see my dog just not getting a healthy diet. We're all overweight and really unhealthy in this family but I tried my damn best to get my dog the best food even if it's fucking expensive and she's ruining it all by giving him only treats and human food.

I want to give the dog away, to people who will take care of his physical health and love him and respect him, but I'm afraid that it will be traumatizing to him. He's been with us pretty much his whole life, and he does love my grandmother. But she's ruining his health.

She gets excited when I come home, likes to snuggle (sometimes), loves to go for walkies with me, and will play with toys (for short periods of time). But occasionally I get the sense that she‚Äôs just kinda putting up with me. She‚Äôll ignore me a lot, especially if there‚Äôs something she‚Äôd rather be doing, she‚Äôll avoid physical touch just enough to make me think I‚Äôm doing something wrong...idk.

Is there something I can learn or some class I can take for like...petting techniques and stuff?

It can still get kinda annoying if we‚Äôre in a rhythm and she suddenly stops to snuffle around.

But I‚Äôve noticed a lot of owners not wanting their dogs to interact with other people at all while in a public space (and not on a walk), like cafes, shops, parks etc. For example, dog walks up to sniff hello, owner notices and calls the dog back, or picks them up and puts them a few feet away. I‚Äôll smile and say ‚Äúno that‚Äôs okay I don‚Äôt mind dogs‚Äù and I‚Äôll get a curt half-smile if anything at all.

I‚Äôll note that I‚Äôve never owned a dog, so I can‚Äôt say I wouldn‚Äôt do the same but what‚Äôs the thought process here? Fear that other people are usually anti-dog? Concern about dognappers (there are some very expensive looking breeds in my area)? Or just reflexive protectiveness?"
210,[Help] Knowing when it's time to let them go?,dogs,t3_aasvgg,4,False,False,aasvgg,"Some Background: I've had my dog 9 1/2 years, since he was 3 months old.  He's a heeler jack russel mix so I expected him to live to an old age, but he has had some major health issues come up.  Found out he has a mass in his chest near his heart that was causing his chest to slowly fill up with blood.  They tapped (drained) his chest and kept him in an oxygen tank for 36 hours. We scheduled a catscan to find out if surgery will be a feasible option or not, soonest they could do is still 5 days out.  He was good for about 5 days after the chest tap, but is starting to show symptoms again.  I have heard these sort of ailment is a very painful thing, and I am just praying he can stay ok until the catscan.  I will be about 3k on bills BEFORE surgery, maybe closer to 4-5k if I have to do the chest tapping procedure again.  
So I wanted to ask anyone out there who has been through putting down a sick dog, how they knew when the time was.  Whether it was a matter of symptoms, or amounting costs, or both, etc.  I know it's horrible to have money be a factor in such things, but I am told the surgery could range from 3-10k and up, and I know my heart is getting in the way of making a wise decision for my own future.  This could set me back years financially, but if there is a strong chance he would get years back from the surgery, I feel like it would be worth it.  Just looking for feedback, support, stories of similar difficult times to help me decide what the right thing to do is.  He is my best friend in the entire world, and I have no idea how to handle the weight of the decisions before me.

211,[discussion] My Corgi Puppy is driving me bonkers!,dogs,t3_aas3hl,11,False,False,aas3hl,"Well, this is basically a rambling post just venting my puppy blues at the moment. I have a corgi puppy who is 11 weeks old who is driving me bonkers! I know- he‚Äôs VERY young and he is a puppy. I know puppies are hard. I think it was just a shock to my system maybe? I got him at 8 weeks old. I have a blue heeler who is 5, and he‚Äôs been amazing- seriously a life saver. He babysits this corgi and puts up with all the puppy biting and crackhead zoomy moments. He‚Äôs been very patient and teaching him so much. Corgi puppy is named Potato. He‚Äôs very smart and has caught on to potty training quickly- i think crate training helped tremendously with that. Potato can just be super frustrating sometimes. He wants to chew on EVERYTHING, and when I tell him no! He likes to bark back at me and then nip at my ankles. I‚Äôve watched lots of videos and redirect him when I can. We have lots of toys, a kong, training treats, etc. i just get so frustrated sometimes! I get anxious and worry he‚Äôs going to be a non stop barking machine who chews everything. I wanted this dog so badly, but right now he‚Äôs not the dog I wanted. Does that make sense? I keep telling myself this is temporary- and as he gets older I will see his personality develop and he will get calmer. I‚Äôm committed to Potato and looking forward to him getting older. Im just posting this right now because I‚Äôm exhausted, my husband is out of town this weekend so I‚Äôve been taking care of potato, his brother, and our asshole cat. Potato has peed twice in the living room tonight and barked a billion times, so I‚Äôm nursing a glass of wine and trying to not cry at the moment.

&amp;nbsp;  
  
Last night we visited the neighbor and surprisingly the old pup was outside his front door sleeping on a blanket. Up to that point we were still trying to determine whether it was a good idea for us to take him. Once we saw the dog's condition up close we decided right then and there (warning: not for sensitive souls): https://imgur.com/a/5F5KZrD

Keep in mind that my neighbor was home at the time. We were furious but we needed to get the surrender form signed so we restrained ourselves. After a very short conversation (we found out his name is Chico) this asshole neighbor signed the form and we brought Chico to our car. We had blankets and the heater on blast for him. He was scared but immediately calmed down when we started petting and soothing him.

Once we got home we set up a pen in our kitchen, with lots of blankets, space heater, and a bed for him to rest. He started snoring. It's weird but that was incredibly gratifying. A few pics of Chico peeking up at me, then being a snoozeberry, and also our two other dogs Kulfi and Bonnie being curious: https://imgur.com/a/sV8FQ8Q  

Later in the night we found that the dog's condition was pretty bad. I had details here earlier but suffice it to say that we discovered he was suffering from debilitating neurological and physical issues. Chico is a tough doggy though. This morning we took him to the emergency vet. It now seemed that euthanization may be the most merciful option. The Banfield nurses were amazing and took us in immediately. They examined him, corroborated the neurological issues, and said that keeping him alive would be difficult and it wasn't clear that the dog was fully aware of his surroundings anymore.

So, we made the decision to give him the long sleep he badly needed. Chico was a sweet boy who deserved better. While I'm not really sure what I'm feeling right now, at the very least I'm happy that his last night here was spent indoors in a cozy bed with our other pups as his friends, instead of out in the cold. We gave him a big kiss and a hug and took one last photo of him snoring (again) at the vet's: https://imgur.com/a/d42oBTe

Disclaimer 2: This is not an anti-adoption or breed discrimination post. Rescuing dogs of all sizes and breeds is amazing and wonderful. Just be careful with your choices. 

3 days ago, my mom decided my grandpa‚Äôs 80 lb farm dog needed a friend. She went to the shelter to get a puppy, but it had already been adopted. So instead, she finds another 80 lb, 8 month old mix breed dog. 

He was very sweet. Played great with other dogs. Loved people. And showed no interest in or aggression towards our livestock (horses and cows). So awesome! Looked like he was going to be a great fit. 

2 days ago, my husband notices the dogs playing near the horses, but we didn‚Äôt think anything of it. We didn‚Äôt see or hear any of the horses in distress. 20 min later our neighbor knocks on my door. Despite the best efforts of our loyal donkey to protect the herd, the new dog had fatally attacked our beloved pony. A miniature horse named Nugget. My first horse, and our family pet. We had to put our Nugget down to stop his suffering. And we put the new dog down so he couldn‚Äôt hurt anything else. It was a tragic day. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. My husband and I could have stopped it if we had gone to see what the dogs were doing. My parents could have prevented it had they spent more time screening the dog for any aggressive behavior.  

We get these dogs with unknown history and temperaments. We know to check for the big stuff. Obvious aggression to other animals, food aggression, chasing livestock, etc., but we never thought that 1. He would be able to take down a 300 lb pony, and 2. That the donkey wouldn‚Äôt be able to chase him off. 

My heart is broken. But lesson learned the hard way. Don‚Äôt trust a dog you don‚Äôt know anything about until they prove they‚Äôre trustworthy. Don‚Äôt take a dog from the shelter or off the street and trust them to be safe around your other pets, children, elderly, etc. because you just can‚Äôt know within a few hours. It took this dog 24 hours to tear a hole in our family‚Äôs heart. And this one was just a pony, what if it had been a child?

However, we met a great dane in the park and he actually played with him!  After two years to see my dog enjoying another dogs company was wonderful.  We run into them occasionally and he always is happy and wants to play.  This has carried over into other great danes he met, and SOME large dogs.  I think it is enormously therapeutic for him.

* Puppy aged.
* Two puppies available: Blaze (""Bla for short""), Sandy, and... all of a sudden Olivia's there too.
* No price listed, because CL prohibits pet sales--but ""rehoming fees"" for adoptions are allowed. 
* BS reason for rehoming (""I have taken a traveling job"").

229,[Help] My 8 year old dog is acting stranger than usual with tremors in her back legs. What is this?,dogs,t3_aarfh9,2,False,False,aarfh9," 

My 8 year old ShihTzu has a vet appointment for tomorrow afternoon, but I figured I'd jump on Reddit to see if anyone else has had a similar experience with their dog. I initially noticed several years ago that my dog would start acting anxious and panting when the toilet would make a certain noise (There was a part that needed to be replaced which caused the noise). This was also the case with other certain noises such as when a door would slam if the windows were open and it was windy outside. Her back legs would start shaking and vibrating and she would behave strangely in other ways too. For example, she would make her way into a corner, follow me everywhere and beg for me to pick her up, sit on her behind, try to climb onto the table, not eat, etc. I took her to the vet and they said everything was okay with her and it must be anxiety. Not wanting to put her on medication we took some advice from the vet on how to help her. Fortunately the natural remedies worked and whenever she would act up we knew how to calm her down and she would be back to normal in 20 minutes tops. Not that this was a common thing happening either. Rather rare actually.

However, about a week ago I noticed she started behaving like this more frequently and there were no noises causing this behavior now. I realized whenever were getting ready to leave the house (getting dressed and putting on our shoes) she would start behaving strangely again. Even if one of us left the house she would get anxious and not act the same despite using all the natural remedies that worked on her before. She would be instantly okay though when the family member would come back home. I am worried that she's getting older and her anxiety is worsening. I also worry if we may need to put her on medication. I don't know what the side effects could be. Does anyone else have experience with this kind of thing? I'm nervous about what the vet will say tomorrow. Any advice?"
230,[Help] Aggressive 10 yr Chug,dogs,t3_aar98p,3,False,False,aar98p,"Hello,

    Throw away account for honest opinions. I have a female Chihuahua Pug that I‚Äôve owned since she was a puppy. The dog started out awesome and had no issues and was loving and sweet never showing any signs of aggression until about 2 years old. 

TLDR/ 10 year old dog is increasingly aggressive and growls/snaps at my 5 year old son. Sent to boarding in the past but the dog reverted back. Dog bit my son again today, not sure what else to do aside from put the dog down. She‚Äôs only loyal to me but is the ‚Äúfamily dog‚Äù

    We trained her through Petsmart and she learned the basics like sit, shake, down, a stay. 

    Around the age of 2 my mother visiting from out of state  got near her food bowl and then growled and snapped. Slowly but surely the dog got more aggressive as time passed. We sent her to a boarding school where she was gone for 1.5 months, then they trained my wife and I how to handle her at home. She seemed fairly well trained, about 15 days later I deployed to Afghanistan for 8 months. Slowly the dog became less disciplined with my wife being gone for work and wanting to love the dog when home. 

   I got back from overseas and the dog was decent but occasionally got aggressive. We sent her back for 2 weeks of boarding when of vacation to relearn the ways. The dog trainers didn‚Äôt really work with her and just dressed her up and carried her around I guess. They told us to pick her up and put her in her crate if she won‚Äôt go for treats. She‚Äôs snap and growl when you tried to pick her up so we started using a blanket to protect our hands. This backfired. 

When the dog gets bed time she runs out from the blanket and growls and gets upset, or if you move and she‚Äôs under the blanket with you she‚Äôll growl and show her teeth thinking we‚Äôre going to pick her up. We‚Äôve long given up on crating her but she is definitely traumatized by that experience. 

Basically she‚Äôll get aggressive under blankets, she‚Äôll bark at us when we ask each other if we‚Äôre ready for bed. Then we had a child. 

At first the dog was ok with the baby boy, didn‚Äôt really care. We‚Äôd restrict the dog around him to assure he‚Äôd be safe. One day he was playing with his cars and she leaped out of her bed and bite him on the finger breaking the skin. I was ready to put the dog down right there. My wife talked me out of it. 

Fast forward now my son is 5, the dog is 10 and she‚Äôs becoming more and more aggressive. I know her triggers are my son by her food bowl, her bed, playing near one of her toys, and the usual blanket/bed time triggers so we work to prevent those activities. 

The dog gets me up numerous times at night to go outside, sometimes she just looks outside and wants a treat. The dog still urinates or poops in one spot of the bedroom even after I left her out. I think she gets up for treats to be honest.  I wouldn‚Äôt mind her waking me up if she had a legitimate need to relieve herself. My job has long hours and getting up several times a night on some occasions has been rough. 

The dog bit my son today as he was playing with his cars in the living room. Is there any other options aside from putting the dog down?"

If I try to kiss or be intimate with my actual boyfriend he cries and screams and makes all the fun sounds pitties do. His clinginess and need to be cuddled with all the time was adorable but now I can't take him anywhere. My boyfriend wants to get rid of him because Theodore just screams and gets aggressive at him when he comes near me. He's had a trainer for this with no success. Any advice on what I can do to maintain our close bond without out him being my doggo boyfriend?"
237,[Help] needed for itchy beagle,dogs,t3_aapwdr,4,False,False,aapwdr,"My 10 year old beagle has been having skin irritations for quite some time. We did him to the vet and they put him on Benadryl in the morning and at night. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping.

He is constantly itching himself. When it is severe, he bites his skin and we have to put a cone on him to prevent him from chewing himself raw. 

Some info about him:

- Eats Nutrisource weight management food for 4 years
- No signs of dandruff or dry skin when we took closer look
- We live in a rural area and he goes wandering a lot. Possibility of being irritated by something farmers use?

We haven‚Äôt used anything different regarding to cleaning products and his bathing products.

I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for supplements to ask vet about. Or any other tips or advice to help alleviate some of his itching. Thanks so much.

238,[HELP] Rescued dog won't tell us when he needs to go outside and disinterest in treats makes training difficult.,dogs,t3_aarp1t,9,False,False,aarp1t,"My partner and I adopted a new dog (~1 year old) about 4 months ago. He is a fearful dog and it has been difficult, but he's coming around and has been acclimating very well in most aspects. The only problem we can't seem to solve is he won't tell us when he needs to go outside. If you put him outside, he knows it's time to do his business and will do so, so he knows that's the place to potty. But he just won't signal to us in any way when he needs to go. We have another dog who has no problem telling us it's time, and we had hoped he'd learn from him, but no luck so far. We try to keep him on a pretty regular schedule to avoid accidents, but they still happen pretty regularly. Sometimes he will pee on the floor while looking me dead in the eyes. When this happens, I give him a very stern ""NO"" and redirect him outside. He doesn't seem to be picking up on it, and it doesn't help that we're usually not there to see it happening.

My first thought with this would be positive reinforcement for using the bathroom outside, but this little guy has no interest in treats. He'll eat them if you put them in front of his mouth, but he really doesn't seem to think of treats as...well, ""treats."" Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? We are totally at a loss and desperate to fix it."

He's about 3yrs old and he's mostly out of his destructive stages, but he has energy to burn, so we have to make sure things are stored away when we leave because he likes to tear things up when we aren't home. Music/ TV used to work wonders for my wife's Dachshund but Rocky couldnt care less about it lol. I've also tried puzzles and large Kongs filled with treats and something like plain yogurt frozen on the outside. He typically destroys the puzzles and becomes uninterested with the Kongs after getting past the yogurt. We were keeping him outside when we left but my neighbor's house was broken into earlier this year, so we've kept him in the house when we're away ever since.

243,[Discussion] Should I even get dogs if I want vacations?,dogs,t3_aan5sn,18,False,False,aan5sn,"Since my long-ago childhood, I've never had dogs, and only had moderate responsibility for them then. My family w/two kids is now leaning toward getting a dog or two. One of the big things that has held me back before this has been--what about us travelling?

I'd like for the whole family to get out of town for two weeks at a time \[not right away, but once or twice a year\]. We currently don't have family or friends who could step in to take care of the dogs, so that would mean getting a relative stranger house/dog-sitter or sending the dogs to a kennel.

I fear that even a terrific kennel or dog-sitter might still be anxiety hell for a dog. If that's inevitable, then maybe we just shouldn't be a dog family. I'd be curious to hear what experienced dog-people think. (There's plenty of other things to think about when getting dogs, but this is top of my concerns.)

244,[HELP] Having some challenges with my bernedoodle,dogs,t3_aar18t,9,False,False,aar18t,"So, we got a very good looking bernedoodle five months ago. She came from a reputable breeder, and has third generation pedigree parents. We were assured she would likely have a great temperament.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I have to tell you, the first four months were rough. Pira√±a teeth being the worst offence.  


Now that she's calming down a bit and not biting us every five seconds, we still have some issues:

  
(1) We don't always get a chance to clean up the backyard every time she poops. She's taken to finding her previous poop and, in today's case, running around with it in her mouth. How can we encourage her to stop this? She's also been caught eating it fresh-out-of-the-can.  
(2) She's very good at asking to go out to poop and has been since early on. Do you think we can train her to do this for pee? Nooooo. It's so bad that we can let her in from being outside for half an hour and she'll promptly pee on the floor.  
(3) The breeder did warn us that Bernese can be stubborn. We hadn't really seen this until this week. She's started deciding she doesn't want to walk anymore and puts out her front legs like a plow to stop me from pulling her along.  


Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with the above? Thanks."

I spoke with multiple laywers and they all said basically the same thing that I am legally not entitled to anything other than financial damages which in this case is the market value of a puppy (and medical bills if the dog isn't already dead). The hundreds of hours and to train a dog, cost of food, medical care, emotional investment, etc, has no value in the eyes of the law.

&amp;#x200B;

If you neglect, abuse, or kill your own dog you can go to jail for years, but if your neglect and willful disregard for laws results in the death of someone else's dog then you're just out a few hundred bucks? I'm not saying that I know what is fair compensation for the death of a dog, but I'd think it's obvious that a well trained dog is worth several thousand in training time alone. How can a few hundred dollars be deemed fair compensation for killing someone's dog?

246,[VENT] I'm getting tired of the discrimination against my dog.,dogs,t3_aaon1z,24,False,False,aaon1z,"Hey all, I have an all american bully breed mutt (American Bull dog mixed with Australian Cattle and possibly pit) and he seems to be a hit or miss for people, not for his attitude but clearly for his looks.

There are days when I'm walking and most will be like ""that's an awesome dog"" or ""look how cute he is"" and continue on with no breeze and then there are mixed days like today where a woman looks right at him and goes ""he better be friendly"" or when he was touching noses with a maltese and the owners go ""nuh uh, no. Keep walking"" as they allow a smaller breed dog to keep talking to theirs. Or when I'm sitting at the vet and he's calmly sitting next to me and a woman across the way says ""he's not going to bite my baby's head off is he?"" 

No, he's not going to bite your baby's head off. He's not agressive. He's the sweetest dog I've ever owned and just wants to be loved. While I'm grateful to have him when walking at night (I live in a sketchy area), I'd wish people would ease up a little. Is that so much to ask?

Edit: Thanks all for the advice. I'm gonna try ""I'm friendly"" bandanas the next time I'm in a high volume area. 

To clarify things: my boy is a 3 year old rescue, about 45 lb but basically all muscle. He's lived with small dogs, my mom's toy poodle and they play together quite often. He's very gentle.  He's my good boy who understands all the obedience commands. I knew when I adopted him that there might be some prejudice against, but I didn't realize people would be so blatant about it.

Edit 2: Lol I realize I probably should have marked this as ""discussion"". It is interesting to see others' inputs on specific dog breeds and stories relating to such. I didn't realize this ""vent"" would be so controversial but I did get some great advice. To share one, growing up I had a mini poodle named Ryssa who hated dogs and children. She snapped at my sister when she was a baby. She once caused a curious Rottweiler to bleed. However, I didn't seem to grow a prejudice as it would've been quickly proven wrong by my other childhood dogs. I'm sorry that all of ya'll who have dealt with horrible situations with bully breeds or pits had to go through that, but to have such a strong prejudice on one breed or style of breed astonishes me when any breed of dog can be vicious to similar extent. #notallpits"
247,[help] Irritated by neighbor's aggressive dogs,dogs,t3_aaokty,2,False,False,aaokty,"I'm a new dog owner, though I've lived with a few before and even helped train one, Elias is my first dog that's belonged to me. He's a German Shepherd mix and I've had him a little less than a month now. And things have been going pretty okay all things considered. We got him from a rough situation and he was pretty underweight and we can still feel his spine but he's putting weight on, and no doubt he rarely if ever went on walks, he had zero leash manners and I've been working with him to stop pulling so much. Mostly I'm trying to teach him to focus better outside.
He's 6 years old, and honestly the biggest baby of a dog I've ever known and thinks he's a lap dog. He loves dogs and children, too much sometimes, nothing gets him pulling like seeing another dog on a walk, and he really isn't aggressive about it-low tail wagging, no growling or barking, sometimes whining. Which is kind of shocking to me since I've known plenty of dog-aggressive dogs(though smaller than him) and he wasn't neutered (yet) so I guess I was expecting to deal with it. The only aggression I've seen from him is when someone parks by our house and he'll grumble a bit, when someone knocks he barks, and when a man he doesn't know comes in he'll bark and growl, but he gets over it fairly quick. Nothing more than that. He does great out of house with men, only has problems in our house.

Now my neighbors have 3 dogs, two shih-tzu looking dogs that never stop yapping at him when they're outside or sitting in front of the screen door (almost all the time), and one big kind of long haired black dog. I don't know the breed-not that it really matters anyway- but that dog will even bark at me alone outside, pretty aggressive all the time, a very growly bark and the tail is way up. This dog has a serious staring problem with my fiance and I and especially with Eli, unsurprisingly.

Unfortunately we do not have a fence and I can't put one up even if I could afford to (assuming it's expensive? Never looked into it) because of some building rules where we live.

Usually Eli has done very good at ignoring the dogs, he'll look but won't care whatsoever, but today he actually got a bit aggressive and tried lunging at them, getting a little poofy even. I pulled him around to the side of the house where he couldn't see them anymore, and tried to get his attention but he was still very much wanting to go back and try to get to them.

To be fair I did get a bit surprised and a little nervous once I saw them and I'm worried that affected the situation. We think there are 3 older people living in that house and they all act very different about their dogs, one will bring them in or shut the door, puts a diaper thing on the big dog (seems to think I'll let my dog loose??) And the other doesn't care. I was taken by complete surprise when they were let out while we were outside. 

Now I'm not really sure if just taking him inside was the right thing to do. Of course I made sure to praise him when I got him to focus on me during everything, but I'm wondering if I should keep him out next time and work through it with him. And if so, would anyone have some advice about doing that? And if it's important to know he's never outside alone, I'm always out with him."
248,[Help] My dog is aggressive towards other dogs for no apparent reason.,dogs,t3_aapzis,4,False,False,aapzis,"So my family got this new dog, a boerboel, over the summer and I have to say it's probably the worst decision they ever made.

To start the family we got it from only gave us the dog because they said it bit their son. This should have raised a red flag but they assumed they were just not taking care of it. So we took it in because it was just about 4 months old and our older dog just died and initially there wasn't any major problems except it was very destructive and didn't respect the personal space of the other dogs. 

The major problems started a month ago when it attacked my oldest dog because of food, I wasn't around and I was told by my brother that it was the only time. Later it attacked my other boerboel and damn near killed him so we have been separating them. Two weeks ago we decided to release all three dogs because we assumed the aggression had calmed down but the younger boerboel attacked the older boerboel seemingly unprovoked and didn't let go of his throat and ear until I broke a paint bucket over his head.

I am truly sick of that dog and boerboels in particular. I want it gone, hell if it died right now I'd be happy but my brother keeps giving the dog leeway and refuses to let it go, sometimes excusing the bad behaviour as 'the dog's nature'. Do you have any advice at all because I swear if it attacks any dog or human again I am going to get rid of it. "

My boyfriend 27 has no experience with dogs yet. I live with small dogs all my life. I trained and retrained dogs. I have a lot of experience with dogs, but can't decide on a breed. We prefer larger dogs. I want a dog that is willing to please his owner, for I like to train my dogs and play/learn tricks. I would be open to do sports etc. For I have an amputation, I can't walk far myself so i need a wheelchair or take the dog on a bike ride. So in a park/forest I need a dog that comes when I call, that won't chase everything it sees to the end of the earth. (therefore dogs like a husky would be a no go). 

We have a bit of a preference towards a;
*  long stock German Sheppard dog (but agression?? /energy) 
*  Eurasier (don't know a lot about the breed) 
*  Novia duck tolling retriever (is he easily distracted outside?) 
*  Keeshond (smaller size, very furry) 

 I am scared of agression issues. (our small dogs get attacked several times in the forest by those gsd, would not want it to be my dog that attacks) 
Any people with experience with well trained GSD: is there still agression towards other dogs? 
Is a Toller to hyper energetic to come back while in the forest?  

  **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * this will be our first dog that I (24F) will train by myself. I lived with different smaller dog breeds throughout my life. My parents breed Papillion and white keeshond (spits dog?). I do have had a Papillion that lived with me for quite some years as well, and had other dogs to train as well. Boyfriend has zero experience. 

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    **Personal Preferences**

    9)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * larger breeds

    10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * No slobbering! Bulldogs I do not like. Shedding and barking I can work with :)

    16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

    * no

    **Lifestyle**

    17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * this is an issue in my head. We will both be working during the day. Not sure if garden/doggy door would be Ok√©. I feel like I will hire a dog walker or work something out with my work to be home an hour in de day..

I live in an apartment so even if I catch her before she goes, will I have enough time to go out the door, elevator down to the street and then let her go?

&amp;#x200B;

She has gone pee many times at random intervals, always just a tiny bit. Most of the times not paying any attention to the pee pad, but a few times she did get it. Not sure if it was random chance or learning. I put some paper towels I used to clean up a couple accidents on the pads to attract her while using the enzyme cleaner in all accident locations. Same situation for poop - she actually has tried to hit the pad each of the 3 poops she has taken.

Also, We took her for a long walk after she peed a few times and she did not go at all. Immediately after returning home she went. After I see shes making an accident and I don't catch it in time I don't punish or anything but I do set her on the pee pad for a few seconds to try to associate pee with the pad. She is very fast. How often should we refresh the pee pad - after every time or let her pee a few times on it first? Would love any advice on house training."

He's mostly good - knows basic commands, does not root through trash or chew. He is a little funny around people and takes a while to settle down. He cries a low whine if we are busy. He hates being cuddly. He does not play with toys. We've had issues where he is aggressive with us. We're doing the best we can, learning how to avoid situations and change behaviors. It's getting better. But I think this is as good as it will get. 

Just this morning I was organizing his records and saw that we had overlooked a pretty critical detail (actually, the rescue failed to tell us, but neither here nor there). He'd been adopted before, in May, and returned 3 months later. The notes read ""unrealistic expectations."" And I look at this dog who sometimes gets growly and grumpy, and who won't go near a lap, and... I get it. I do. He's not your ideal. 

Owning a dog was nothing like I thought it would be. But I will not give up on him. Even if he never cuddles, if he never plays fetch...at the end of the day, I am still giving this grumpy old dog a safe place, and I think he and I are both better off because of it.

260,[Help] My Chocolate Lab has severe anxiety issues and weird licking/blinking episodes,dogs,t3_aaon7g,2,False,False,aaon7g,"I have a 8 year old chocolate lab named Dolly. She is an energetic attention seeker who loves playing ball and going for walks. She gets along okay with my pit Sally (although she does boss her around a lot). She is a bit of a troublemaker and can get a bit crazy during playtime. She is a handful, but overall she is a great dog.

A few years ago, my mom noticed that she was having weird episodes of licking and blinking. We went to the vet for this and they gave us pills to give her in case if any more episodes. 

Earlier this year she began to be increasingly more anxious. One day she saw a small child on a walk with my brother and she screamed and ran home. Ever since then, she would either freeze and cry or just run away whenever she saw small children.

In the past few months she has had similar reactions to older children, unfamiliar adults, and unfamiliar dogs. Her anxiety has gotten so bad that she sometimes will refuse to go on walks altogether, only going when Sally came with her. 

Over the holidays, she has started to chew up random objects. She has chewed up a clicker, a game disc, several ornaments, countless laundry baskets, and a candle.

Are all of these behaviors linked somehow? Does she have some kind of illness that we aren‚Äôt aware of? Or is it just because she‚Äôs getting old?

TLDR: dog is getting anxious, becoming scared of stuff, and having weird episodes of blinking and licking"

263,"[Breeds] Rottweiler vs Labrador. Who wins the neighborhood, ‚ÄúBest Dog‚Äù award.",dogs,t3_aar3gn,5,False,False,aar3gn,"

A little background...the dog next door is an old mean Labrador Retriever. My daughter has a Rottweiler. We raised our Rottie here since a pup, and the Lab next door has always come out, immediately rushed to the fence and commenced to doing the Barky/growly thing. Taught our Rottie to do it back and they play that game running up and down the fence, only it doesn‚Äôt sound like playing. More like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kill you‚Äù crap. So of course everyone thinks our Rottie is vicious. The man next door keeps telling his Lab it doesn‚Äôt want to mess with our Rottie, as she‚Äôd eat him.
 Ok fast forward. My daughter and her husband/kids are away, so I and my husband walk the Rottie daily. (More me, as my husband is sickly and just goes along for the exercise.) so during the walk, if I feel we someone coming by that may be afraid, I always take our Rottie aside, make her sit and stay and look at me. She‚Äôs very good at this. She remains calm and sits until we begin to walk again. (I‚Äôve seen people cross the street rather than walk by us.)
So this afternoon, as I go out the front with her for our walk, I noticed old mean Lab out in the front yard with his pregnant owner. He‚Äôs not on a leash. I think...oh shit!  So Rottie sees him, and basically ignores him, as he begins to bark and snarl from his yard.  Then old dog starts heading for us in attack mode. We were headed away from him up a hill and I didn‚Äôt want Rottie getting excited so I had her sit and stay, concentrating on me.  Btw, it‚Äôs easier to do this than to try to hold an excited Rottweiler.  I really did think the Lab would go to his owner as she was calling him, walking after him or she‚Äôd catch him. Nope, the old bastard kept heading toward us. As he almost got to us, looking as if he was gonna take a hunk outa me, I thought ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gonna bite me!!‚Äù  Rottie must have felt me tense, she turned and looked at him, and then forcibly backed up (he was coming up behind her) as I tried to pull her, coming out her collar. CRAP!!!  I fell straight on my ass on the street. Rottie immediately blocked the Lab, got her hackles up and did an open mouth snarl at him, backing him up. (You ever see that snarl, you know how scary that is.).  I thought somebody was gonna die then, but low and behold, old Lab did one more little mean bark then quieted down. Rottie began smelling him and basically looking down at him as I remained where I‚Äôd fallen. Collar and leash in my hand. The lady comes up, kept asking me if I was okay (I was) and grabbed the Lab by the collar, dragging him home.  Our wonderfully Rottie just stayed there watching, then looked at me as if to say ‚ÄúYou gonna get up or what?‚Äù And sat till I got her collar and leash back on. Then off we went on a shorter walk.

Side note...the only thing my husband said about the whole thing (who knows where the heck he was all this time) was ‚ÄúGood thing you got a big ass, that could‚Äôve been painful.‚Äù

Moral 1: Rottweilers are not stupid or vicious if trained and raised correctly.

Moral 2: Unless your dog is very well trained, don‚Äôt let them off the leash. You never know what could arise."

He got a sleepypod harness for an early Christmas present,  since we did over a thousand miles of road trip this week. He broke my current seat protector just before the final leg of our multi-stop journey, so I need a new one.

My problem is, he's 50 inches from nose to base of tail and my backseat is 54 inches wide. The way the sleepy pod clicks in to the seatbelts, it slowly gets dragged up his neck. He also is forced to lay with his nose on the door. (The seatbelts are too short for him to sit up with it clicked in properly.)

269,[Help] Can a house cause a dog to poop inside?,dogs,t3_aani4m,5,False,False,aani4m,"We own a 13yo cocker, and we moved into a new house almost a year ago. Shortly after we moved in, the cocker went through some behavior changes (waking up very early, barking at seemingly nothing, going outside and then 15 minutes later making a mess inside) that we had just chalked up to getting older. Our most recent frustration is that she will go out and then come in and poop in her diaper, which she then carries around and gets on the furniture.

&amp;#x200B;

However, we went away for a vacation with friends over the last week and she didn't poop in the house a single time. She peed in the diaper a couple times because she's never been good at telling people she needs to go outside, but she hadn't pooped the entire time we were on vacation - only to poop in her diaper within an hour of getting home. All her other behavior changes were present (barking at seemingly nothing, very food motivated, waking up early) - just not the most

272,[Fluff] First Year of Dog Ownership - Detailed Expenses and Thoughts!,dogs,t3_aac9fh,40,False,False,aac9fh,"#Background
After 20+ years of wanting a dog, we were finally in a place where we had the time and the money to afford a dog. After following various rescues for several years, we knew that we wanted to adopt.

A lot of people have misconceptions about rescue dogs and rescue organizations. We chose a rescue that was foster-based, meaning all dogs were put in foster homes with real families. All dogs are screened at the city animal control for temperament. We liked this rescue because they had a thorough vetting process for both fosters and adopters, and they also had a 2 week 'trial adoption' period to help find the perfect fit.

Bodie was the first dog we saw through the rescue. He lived in a foster home with 2 grade school aged children, and 2 other dogs. We fell in love and adopted Bodie in January of 2018.

#Thoughts
**Challenges**

* He's not *perfect*. It took us a while to come to terms with the fact that he'd never be perfect. Then again - what dog truly is? He is a rescue and likely grew up on the streets. He is sometimes uncomfortable with loud children and especially large men. We have had to invest a LOT of time and money into training.
* Puppy blues are real. He wasn't even a puppy, but for the first few months, he had to be let out on the hour for potty breaks and he HATED his crate. It was hard adjusting to simply being responsible for another living creature and learning to plan our days/weeks in advance. Our schedules are sometimes like Tetris and it truly requires good communication.
* Poop. So much poop. When did he poop? What was the consistency of his poop? The amount of poop we talk about on a daily basis is absurd, but it truly is one of the best way to assess the health of a dog. We had to get comfortable with it REAL fast. There were mistakes made with holes in poop bags. 
* We live in a major metro city and don't have a yard. Walking around in the winter sucks. Walking around in the winter with a dog sucks even more. Prepare to spend 20 minutes each morning putting on jackets and boots for the both of you, and prepare to be pulled on ice for an entire city block because he sees a squirrel and your neighbors didn't salt their side walks.
* Holy hell vet costs are expensive. Who knew that just a basic annual check up with vaccines and heartworm/tick medication would run us well over $500? Where are people paying $200 for vet visits a year?!

**Wins**

* His excitement when we come home makes it all worth it.
* Seeing him blossom and his 'firsts'. His first time playing with a toy. His first time eating a bully stick (and learning that it's not a weapon he will be hit with). His first time asking for belly rubs. His first time jumping into the lake. His first time getting a Christmas present.
* We truly lucked out with a dog that does NOT counter surf, chew things, destroy things, or test any boundaries. You could tape a piece of paper across a doorway and he would cry because it's an impassible barrier.
* He is SO smart and picks up tricks in an instant. We started nosework classes to help build his confidence and to give him something to do in the colder months. We hope to be those crazy dog parents that compete with their dogs in competitions someday.
* Although he's too hyperactive for doggie daycare, he does great with dogs and is superbly tolerant of puppies! We hope to foster dogs in the future, when we have a bigger home.
* Take advantage of local dog groups on Facebook/Reddit and breed specific groups/rescue alumni groups to build a network of dog friends. Not only is it great for play dates, but it's also great to have a network of support when you need to vent. We met many friends this way!

#Expenses
[This year, we spent a whopping $6,150.34](https://i.imgur.com/8uFQjUK.png). Note: we live in a major metro area (Chicago). I will be the first to admit that I am dog obsessed (he's basically my hobby) and spend more on the dog than myself and my partner combined. We are lucky enough to be able to budget and afford doggie luxuries.

[For next year, I'm predicting that it will be closer to $3,000 - $3,500, or $270 - 300 a month](https://i.imgur.com/UBKHY04.png). Next year's expenses will primarily be food, supplements, vet, some boarding, and training. 

If we were to truly minimize costs, I would still expect to budget $1,500 at a MINIMUM to cover basic food and vet costs for a dog.

[Our spend by percentage](https://i.imgur.com/AR3U9eZ.png):

* 'Startup/non-consumable' costs were pretty big for us - about $2k. It included several expensive items like waterproof couch covers to protect from potty accidents/hair on our nicer furniture, a storage bench for all his toys, 2 air purifiers to help our allergies, and a hard crate and soft crate. We spent a LOT on toys, including a CleverPet hub and several enrichment toys. Luckily, he tends to preserve his toys, so these costs will not be incurred next year and should be pretty minimal. 
* 'Service' costs were the largest category, and consisted of boarding, daycare, vet visits, health insurance, and rescue events that we attended. We started traveling less for work in the summer and have more opportunities for work from home, so boarding and daycare will likely drop next year. He started becoming more reactive/protective towards men in early May and we did some training sessions in August to help with his behavior. We would like to continue his training and nosework so costs may stay the same overall. 
* 'Consumable' costs were pretty low in comparison to the first two. We tried several food brands before switching to lamb kibble at Costco, which is pretty cost effective. We also tried several treats at the beginning of ownership but have settled on primarily peanut butter, pumpkin, dental chews, and bully sticks. We buy these on Costco in bulk to help reduce costs. 

If you read this essay, thank you. Questions are welcome!

tl;dr: Dog is expensive. Dog is worth it. 

tl;dr2: I would budget at least $1.5k for a dog for basic expenses, but expect it to increase drastically if you include boarding/daycare and training.

273,"[Help] Dog has major diarrhea for 3+ days, solution?",dogs,t3_aamidw,7,False,False,aamidw,"Formosan Mountain Dog, 2 years old, 35lbs. 

So last Saturday I realized we ran out of dog food, and I always place my orders online but we are moving out of state this week so I didn't think it would have time to arrive before we leave. 

We were out of town for Christmas and I wasn't able to find hardly anything, so she ate pretty crappy dog foods (both wet and dry) until we got home - from Saturday to Tuesday. 

Wednesday on our drive home she started having diarrhea and I immediately felt bad because of the unexpected and abrupt diet switch. We got home and I found a little Ziploc of her old food, so I switched her to a diet of rice mixed with her normal high quality kibble. I was able to find her normal kibble on Prime and it will be here today. 

The problem is it's now Saturday and she isn't showing any signs of improvement. We have to take her out anywhere between every 2 and 4 hours or she'll potty inside (which she never does). 

Is this normal? It seems like it's going on too long and it's really making me nervous as I'm worried maybe the timing is just coincidental and she is actually sick? The only thing that is making me think it's just a digestive issue we should wait out is that her disposition is completely normal otherwise - high energy, drinking lots of water, no other behavior changes aside from frequent bathroom breaks. 

If it's normal, what can I do to help heal her stomach? When calling around trying to find her food, one pet store worker said to give her raw goat's milk. Should I try that? In any case, how long should I expect this to go on before she would show signs of improvement? So far it's been 3, going on 4, days. 

Thank you!

274,[help] dog hates going outside and on walks,dogs,t3_aai5de,7,False,False,aai5de,"Hi! So I adopted a sweet 1.5 year old mutt earlier this year and she‚Äôs the love of my life. The rescue actually shoved her on me after I‚Äôd been approved and prepared for another dog entirely‚Äîbut then two days before the original dog was set to arrive, they suddenly said the dog wasn‚Äôt going to come and would I try this one instead. She wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting but I love her deeply and have zero intention of ever giving her back. She was given to me with two types of worms and severely underweight (which I was not told about and I noticed the worms a day after she‚Äôs come to me but that‚Äôs all fixed now and she‚Äôs gained about 4 pounds since I had her with the help of chicken)

Long story short, since this wasn‚Äôt the dog I planned on bringing to my home I have zero knowledge of her past and what has happened to her before me. I‚Äôve tried to email and call the rescue to try and get some details but they remain unresponsive and have not checked in or asked since giving me the papers. So, okay.  So I‚Äôm dealing with her behavioral problems as they come. We have some separation anxiety and we‚Äôre scared to ask for things like treats and going on the bed but again‚Äîworking on it and she is getting better with it so it‚Äôll just take time with that. She‚Äôs so sweet and she just wants to cuddle and she gets so happy when she does she makes crying noises. She also surprisingly likes the cat and the cat likes having the dog‚Äôs attention.

But

She hates the outside. Like HATES going outside. She works herself up so much that sometimes we have accidents if she sees me putting shoes on or getting the leash. I live in an apartment in an extremely urban area so I don‚Äôt have access to a backyard but there is a park half a block from me. The problem is‚Äîshe hates all outdoor activities. I‚Äôve tried using treats but she gets so nervous she will not eat outside. She‚Äôll jump on my leg and hug it with her front paws for safety if we go too far. She‚Äôs such a sweet girl and we‚Äôre working on our fear of the harness and leash by putting it on and not going outside so she can get used to it and luckily, we‚Äôre no longer scared of the harness. But she shakes continually on walks and does not like any of it. I just need some pointers on what to do to get her more comfortable‚ÄîI want to do right by her and give her good experiences from here on out, since she clearly did not have a good start to her life. I also warned the rescue that I did not have a backyard so the dog would have to go on walks to be relieved and they said she was good on walks which.....okay. No. But alright.

Things we are currently trying:


-short walks around the block simply to relieve ourselves. She‚Äôs used to the block now but still gets nerrrrrvous at one part. But we‚Äôre keeping it short and brisk.

-playing sounds of traffic on Spotify in the background while I am at home and paying attention to her so she can get used to city noises. She seems unbothered by it.

-I give pats on walks if she does things well, like sniffing or engaging in her environment. She‚Äôs not food or toy motivated but she‚Äôs a goner for some good pats and ear rubs.

-I‚Äôm looking into a behavioralist to help but I gotta get my tax return first. That ain‚Äôt cheap and I need a bit more time before I can reasonably afford it and not be awake panicking about rent.  I‚Äôm up for a promotion soon so hopefully it wont be long until I can call some good backup in but in the meantime, not yet.


She is the sweetest dog on four legs and just wants to make me happy but I want her to be unafraid to go outside. She doesnt need to be adventure dog and LOVE walks, Indifference to outside would be ideal."

The dog was surrendered there by someone anonymously, so we don‚Äôt know her history.

Ever since we met her, she‚Äôs been scared and timid. We are slowly trying to gain her trust, but any random sound or sudden movement scares her. She would sit in a corner by the door and not move from her spot, regardless of us gently coaxing her out with pets or treats. She wouldn‚Äôt even eat. 

We‚Äôve been taking her on two to three walks a day and she will pee. We‚Äôve finally been able to coax her into her crate last night (making her know it‚Äôs a safe spot where she has toys and treats), so she began laying in there instead today. She even ate!

But then, my bf and I went shopping for two and a half hours and left her alone. She was fine when we got back, no accidents or torn up furniture, so we took her on a walk right away. But I noticed she was more hyper-ish on the walk and skittish. 

She did poop! But when we got home, she went back into her corner and not her crate. My bf tried getting her out of the corner to show her it was ok to move about, but she kept going back. I tried brushing her, but she‚Äôs staying.

She will only walk about the apartment if we leave her area, and she only ate today when my bf left the room and I didn‚Äôt look at her. We‚Äôve been reading up on anxious behavior and how to help, but I‚Äôm worried.

278,[Help] Really need help identifying recurring sores on dogs paws (2 vet visits already with no certain diagnosis).,dogs,t3_aak8ss,11,False,False,aak8ss,"So I‚Äôve posted this here before with the pics, only to have EVERY single comment saying to go for another vet visit. Please if you‚Äôre going to say that just don‚Äôt comment, I brought him to a different vet just to be told (again) that they aren‚Äôt sure what it is and prescribe another month of antibiotics, which helps for a bit but it always comes back.

[pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/4RgQkxC), ok so these sores keep popping up on multiple paws, they last around 3 weeks and go like this. It‚Äôs red and inflamed, then after a week it‚Äôs a pus filled defined bump, it pops on its own (probably due to his licking) and becomes an open sore, then eventually heals. The first vet said foxtails but I‚Äôm pretty positive that‚Äôs not it, they get better on their own which from what I‚Äôve seen isn‚Äôt usually the case for multiple foxtails. The second vet (different one) said she honestly wasn‚Äôt sure what was happening and just gave me another round of antibiotics. I stopped giving him all table scraps in case it was an allergy, with no relief yet.

This is recurring as in it‚Äôs usually like one or two paws at a time for weeks at a time, then it heals and he gets new ones. My only guess at this point is either some kind of recurring illness or stinging nettles. After I figured out it could be nettles I started picking them all out of the yard as soon as they pop up, they are difficult to keep out so it is possible this is still the issue, but I don‚Äôt understand why they would cause a weeks long reaction when in humans (and the dogs I‚Äôve googled) the reaction lasts less than a day.

280,[Help] Should I be worried about puppy‚Äôs reaction to first vaccine?,dogs,t3_aal27q,5,False,False,aal27q,"My 12 week old Collie pup had her first shot yesterday. The vet said it was completely normal if she felt tired afterward and had some swelling around the injection site. She slept really well last night so I assumed the vaccine made her tired which is fine. However this afternoon she has vomitted (only once) and her stools are very loose. She was due to be wormed this weekend also and the vet said it was okay if we gave her a worming treatment on the same day as her vaccine. Im not sure if it‚Äôs the vaccine, the combo of the vaccine and worming treatment or the just the stress from going to the vets (she hates going in the car) and having a bath this morning (she hates the bathtub) that has given her an upset stomach. I‚Äôm worried she may be having an allergic reaction but I‚Äôm really not sure.

Then I thought he was answering at dogs barking(we live in a neighborhood where almost everyone keep their dogs outside, even when it‚Äôs freezing or very warm. It‚Äôs not my case!)

283,[Help] My mom and sister adopted a pitbull and I fear they might be in over their heads,dogs,t3_aaclll,63,False,False,aaclll,"They adopted an American Pitbull Terrier, he is only 1.5 years old and he came home from a shelter yesterday. 

I am prepared for downvotes because I am going to discuss the potential for aggression in the APBT breed. 

[This old comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3e4rit/_/ctc9tpv?context=1000) was very informative about the breed. If I'm wrong to trust the sources, correct me. 

Anyways, my mom and sister have never owned a dog before, and I'm not sure if they will be able to do proper training, as already they're telling him conflicting messages.. but maybe they can fix that. They have one free training class (haven't gone yet) but I don't know if they'll do more. I hate to say this, but I'm genuinely afraid of this dog. And I know it might make it worse, but idk how to not feel this way.

They just got him yesterday but so far I've noticed following. I just wonder if they're signs of aggression or what: 

‚Ä¢According to his records at the shelter, he sustained an injury on his leg and some bite marks on his chest. He has scarring and his fur has some blood stains that won't go away. My family assumes he was attacked.

‚Ä¢He met another dog. They sniffed eachother for a minute and it seemed good. But after that he began growing and trying to get closer towards the other dog. My sister was holding him by the collar and he made choking sounds. The dog left and he returned to normal.

‚Ä¢My sister touched the funny looking part of his mouth area and he opened his mouth to show his teeth and turned towards her. He stopped when she kind of yelled no.

‚Ä¢Meeting the neighbor dogs through a fence. He doesn't really bark, but he started to make weird growlish sounds after a second and my sister had to hold him back and tell him no.


He doesn't listen very well yet. Is it possible for him to be an easy going safe dog? My sister wants to take him to a dog park and I just imagine a disaster. I don't know how to not be afraid, which might be a separate issue. Is there any recommended tips for dealing with potential aggression? Training tips?

Also, just a disclaimer, I don't have a personal vendetta against the breed, I think they deserve love and happy lives. I just think the dog might need very good training where the owners acknowledge the potential for aggression.. my family currently believes he has the same chance of aggression as any other dog. Idk, I just don't think that's a responsible way to go about it. If I'm wrong, correct me.. Thanks."
284,[RIP] Roxy,dogs,t3_aae9iv,5,False,False,aae9iv,"A few days ago I posted about next steps for cancer. It started last weekend, we noticed my best friend roxy started to have a bit of a gut. At 7 years old i brushed it off that she‚Äôs getting older and she‚Äôs just got a tummy. Wednesday night she started breathing funny, she snores so it didn‚Äôt raise much of an eyebrow so I let it go. Thursday it continued, almost light a sigh/stretch sound when she would exhale. Friday I began to get extremely worried and brought her to the ER. They did X-ray and make me wait 2 hours for results. I‚Äôm crying st this point and roxy looks at me with these eyes ‚Äúit‚Äôll be ok dad‚Äù and gives me a kiss. They come back with results and say they can‚Äôt see anything and need to ultrasound but couldn‚Äôt ultrasound her as their techs are only there certain days. They said I need to get the ultrasound done to see what is going on in her abdomen as it didn‚Äôt feel right. Saturday I brought her to another hospital and they did ultrasound and saw a mass. They also saw fluid around her lungs. I said do everything you need to do. They removed 1/2 liter of fluid from around the lungs, went into surgery, to then tell
Me it is at the base of the mesentery gland and could not be removed. Fear and so much emotion overcame my wife and I. I felt helpless. They needed to keep my roxy doodle overnight after the surgery. I called Sunday, and was told she was nauseous and they gotta keep her longer, maybe I can get her Monday Xmas eve. 5 pm Sunday the doctor called saying she‚Äôd like to send roxy home. Emotion and tears of happiness filled me as I could have my bub home for Xmas. The doctor said keep an eye on her breathing hopefully fluid doesn‚Äôt come back, but we need to wait a few days to find out what the fluid is from and what the mass is. Doodle had a nice Xmas, I went to store Xmas eve buying her lots of canned food and toys. All the above. I stayed home 12/26 to keep an eye on her breathing and make sure she didn‚Äôt lick stitches. My wife and I made plans to be positive and not leave roxy home alone and always be around family to be careful to watch her and make sure nothing ruptures, as well as make her life more enjoyable and not lonely when we work. I began to feel positivity maybe the mass isn‚Äôt cancer, maybe the fluid won‚Äôt come back, if it does I‚Äôll get her on a diuretic, if it‚Äôs cancer well do chemo. I didn‚Äôt care if we went broke for my roxydoodle. I get a call at 2pm, it‚Äôs lymphoma, and it‚Äôs also effected a node in her chest cavity. I began to have a breakdown and fear for everything as it‚Äôs official.  Fast forward 9pm 12/26 night, her breathing rapidly increases, I say maybe she‚Äôs in pain and gave her s painkiller. My wife stays up til 1 am. Wakes me up, her breathing was over 60 breaths per minute and shallow. We decide we won‚Äôt take the chance and even if it‚Äôs pain, let‚Äôs bring her to the ER. Er does a scan, roxy has over 1 liter around her lung, and her belly is getting even bigger. Tears spewing out of my eyes, I can‚Äôt put roxy through this pain anymore. To drain it again and have her fill up struggling to breathe her again! She didn‚Äôt eat much yesterday either and it was all looking so bad. We make the decision for her own good we don‚Äôt want her to struggle anymore. I lost my absolute best friend 12/27 at 2:20 am. I‚Äôve never had a connection like with roxy. She looks st my wife when they inject her, with those same eyes ‚ÄúI love you mom‚Äù. And lays down. Her breaths are less and less and I keep kissing her and telling how good of s girl she is. I‚Äôm honestly broken and lost a huge part of me this morning. A part I will never have back. I miss my roxy doodle. she was the one who proposed to my wife with the ring. She was there on our wedding day. She truly loved us more than herself, and never would leave our side. I miss her so much and lost part of my heart today. I hope you don‚Äôt think I betrayed you rox, I‚Äôm so sorry and this was the best 7 years I‚Äôve had with you"

287,[Help] My puppies endless energy keeps me awake at night,dogs,t3_aak619,5,False,False,aak619,"Hi, I recently adopted a 4 month old puppy a couple of weeks ago. 

The first 7-10 days he‚Äôs been pretty good at sleeping through the night, perhaps being restless till 1AM at the latest but then sleeping through till 6-7AM. He sleeps in my room but doesn‚Äôt like his crate so just sleeps on the floor. 

Recently however he has been keeping me up till about 4 in the morning by running around and being destructive despite having plenty of toys e.g. we have a patch of newspaper for him to pee on if he‚Äôs desperate during the night, and he just tears this apart. (I imagine this is because he‚Äôs bored as he does this in the morning when he‚Äôs waiting for me to get up and take him for a walk). I know crate training would help limit how destructive he could be but the first week+ he has been fine sleeping without the need for it? 

In terms of exercise he just can‚Äôt get enough, he‚Äôs a husky cross so would go for hours if we‚Äôd let him but we limit him to two 40 minute walks a day, and even then I‚Äôm worried that‚Äôs too much on his growing joints. 

He never seems that tired even after his walks or a training/play session, and if he does nap it‚Äôll be late in the evening so he‚Äôs fully re-charged when it comes to bed time! 

What can I do to wear my puppy out for bed time without over exercising him? Or get him on a sleep schedule that doesn‚Äôt keep me up all night? After 4 nights in a row of this I‚Äôm really struggling and don‚Äôt want to lose my temper with him because of how tired I am. 

Tl;Dr: puppy keeps me awake at night being restless with energy despite efforts to tire him out during the day with walks, training and play time. What can I do?"
288,[Breeds] I‚Äôm not sure what breed my dog is.,dogs,t3_aak5tk,6,False,False,aak5tk,"This probably sounds stupid, but my dog is about three years old now, and it still bothers me that I‚Äôm not entirely sure what breed she is. She looks like a miniature pinscher as far as her primary black and brown markings, but she has a white patch on her chest and patches/speckles all over her head and back, so she‚Äôs likely mixed with something. The vet tech speculated that the mix might even be dachshund, saying something about her face. The thing that really makes me question her breed is her height and weight, though. At a little under a year old she was 13 lbs, thin and lanky as could be and even though she was only about a foot tall, most of that height was from her legs. In two years she‚Äôs gotten a little taller- and she‚Äôs grown into her legs- but she weighs in at 21 lbs. While you can tell she doesn‚Äôt miss any meals, she‚Äôs by no means ‚Äúfat‚Äù and is very active. From what I‚Äôve read, even as a pup she was over the average height and weight for her assumed breed.  Is there another breed anyone thinks she could be, or is she just on the far end of the spectrum for a min pin? I love her all the same, but I‚Äôm curious. 

Pictures are oldest to newest, with some focusing on her size and others on her colors and markings.

289,[Discussion] What do you wish you knew before you got your puppy?,dogs,t3_aahumu,9,False,False,aahumu,"I'm picking up my first puppy in a few days (Bernese mountain dog), she'll be 8-9 weeks when I get her and I won't be able to get her second round of shots (for parvo virus mostly I believe) until she's 12 weeks roughly.

Until then, am I able to take her to parks or places but just **not** have her interact with other dogs or is even that too risky? We'll be doing puppy training but that's 1h per week for 4 weeks, and I want to get her outside more especially as our apartment is relatively small until we move in 3-4 weeks.

Also as far as insurance goes I was considering getting a medium level of coverage for the first year then dropping down to basic after that (what the breeder recommended), any specific recommendations for Australians? Was either Bow Wow Meow or maybe RSPCA.

I have lots of different chew toys, a bed with a blanket for her, good quality food for her and some treats, as well as grooming brushes and the like.

291,[Help] My dog's health is deteriorating and I'm losing my mind,dogs,t3_aag8c9,11,False,False,aag8c9," 

I have an 11 year old King Charles Spaniel. He‚Äôs the absolute love of my life. I‚Äôm not going to waste time describing this breed to you, but they are the most wonderful dogs there could ever be. 

I got him shortly after my mother died and the bond we‚Äôve created is something I could never picture myself living without. Nevertheless, in the past year or so, he started getting more and more health problems. He can still see very well, but his eyes need daily care and medication. He‚Äôs also taking daily medication for his heart disease, which is untreatable and degenerative. To top it all off, we recently discovered that he also has a chronic issue in his spine, that sometimes causes him pain, so he‚Äôs losing some of his mobility, meaning that he needs special dog stairs to get up and down the bed. It also means no more belly rubs, no more getting picked up, because he whines and yelps. We‚Äôre still testing the medication for that, as we don‚Äôt want him to be drugged all the time. Surgery is not an option for neither of his issues.

I am terrified. I always knew that he wasn‚Äôt going to be here forever, but it‚Äôs getting closer and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I still think (or hope) he has at least a couple of years to be with us as he‚Äôs still a very active dog for his age, still playful and curious.

But I can‚Äôt help but think that I won‚Äôt know what to do with myself after he‚Äôs gone. We tried getting another dog a couple of months ago, but I couldn‚Äôt get attached to him at all and the guilt that I felt because it was like I was trying to replace my dog while he‚Äôs still alive was overwhelming. So we ended up rehoming the second dog to another family so he could be happy and loved as he deserved.

I am rational enough to know that this may seem overly dramatic for some people, but for the life of me, I love my dog more than anything in this world and it‚Äôs breaking my heart because there‚Äôs nothing more that I can do to help him. He‚Äôs been by my side, my sole comfort during some very difficult things in my life, so losing my right arm seems like a better choice than not having him with me. It‚Äôs selfish and self destructive, but I don‚Äôt know how to control myself.

If anyone has any advice or has gone through something similar, please help me. I‚Äôm getting desperate and I don‚Äôt have anyone close to me that can relate.

Thank you! "

I was super excited of course, because I love dogs!

The dog got dropped off at my house earlier today with her crate, food, and treats.

I'm having problems already because this dog won't let me out of her sight! If I get up, she immediately JUMPS up and follows at my heel. Even if I just go to the bathroom, she starts crying at the top of her lungs and doesn't stop until I get back. I tried putting her in her crate, and even if I stay right next to the crate she just cries and cries. So, the crate isn't an option apparently, even though I know the owners use it for her when they go out of the house.

Another thing, she seems to get upset when my dogs get closer in proximity to me than she is. She wants to be glued to me, and she doesn't seem to want me to give any attention to my own dogs.

297,[Help] My mum is refusing to use a proper collar for the family dog (UK),dogs,t3_aahvwn,22,False,False,aahvwn,"I've recently returned home from uni for a month to find that my mum has removed my dog's collar and replaced it with.. well, something that I wouldn't consider a collar. I'd like to say I think the situation is utterly ridiculous but the only way I can change this is to convince my mum to change it. I have zero authority. I tried putting my dog's old collar on before I took her for a walk but the next day my mum yelled at me for it, I can't just keep putting my dog's collar on against my mum's wishes because she would kill me.


The makeshift collar consists of a soft, loose, stretchy fabric bandana with ID attached via a carabiner. My mum's reasoning is that it's less ""bulky"" and ""looks cooler"" which I find to be absurd reasoning. My dog, a former street dog, was not initially used to wearing a collar and so it took a while to get her used to wearing one, which is why my mum maintains that the new collar is more comfortable for her. However, before I left for uni 4 months ago she had no issues with her previous collar, and I was making wonderful progress with training. It's worth noting I don't personally think my mother is the best dog owner. She has a history of giving up on training, being lax with vet visits, and tight with any money concerning the dog. She's the kind of person who thinks vets are out to swindle people for money and most vet visits are useless.


Now, in addition to this makeshift collar being extremely ugly, I don't feel right about it and the potential implications for the safety of my dog. My mum gets really defensive if I dare question any of her choices especially about the dog so I have to really back myself up with some concrete arguments if I'm going to successfully confront her about this. I would like to ask what issues there may be (if any) concerning this.


Some things worth noting:


* As far as I'm aware, it's still technically legal because her ID is attached.


* Any time my dog leaves the house, she wears a harness.


* The lead clips on to the harness, not the ""collar"".


* My dog is able to easily slip out of the ""collar"" if she wants to. 


* My dog keeps trying to bite the ""collar"" since it hangs low enough for her to hook her lower jaw around it. 


* There is emotional significance to the ""collar"" since the bandana belongs to our recently deceased dog who my mother was very close to (he used to wear it in addition to his normal collar).


* As a rescue, my dog has issues with guests, other dogs, or anybody who dares walk past the house. I was working on this before I left for uni and making amazing progress, but my mum has little to no interest in continuing training and it seems my dog has reverted a little bit.


* She easily spooks and can act aggressively (lunges, ""bites"" but more like putting her mouth around you, not actually biting) when she feels threatened, or if she is possessive over food (if she or anyone else is eating).


* Previously, as soon as a lead was clipped on to her collar, my dog would instantly behave and be led calmly away.


* The new collar means that we now cannot clip a lead on to her when we may need to remove her from a situation since she just slips out of the collar.


I would like some insight into whether this is bad for my dog or just a very strange but mostly harmless decision. If it is the former, please help me build some concrete arguments that I can use to convince my mum to go back to using a proper collar. Unfortunately, my mum is unlikely to be receptive to any arguments involving training (anything concerning the last 4 bullet points) because I've already brought this up with her and she told me there was nothing wrong, and that no amount of training will change her behaviour. Very frustrating! 


Thanks so much in advance!

Anyway, we hit the 6 mile mark and were coming up to a road so I called him back to me, reached for the leash around my neck... And it wasn't there! 

We went back on ourselves to where I last used it but I just couldn't find it. I decided to head to the nearest pub where I knew they had dogs. We ended up walking over 2 miles past fields of cows and sheep, cyclists and a very excited puppy on leash and my boy stayed by my side the whole time! 

It was like the most intense training session EVER! I tried to limit my commands so I didn't overload him, but it was like he knew something was up so was super responsive to everything! Walking next to me past livestock, sitting next to me while cyclists went by and waiting to be released to greet the puppy.

Edit 2: Just in response to a couple of comments &gt; We live in the UK where dogs are only required to be on lead in areas where there is a specific by-law. Because of this we don't have dedicated off-leash areas, like dog parks, and we're expected to share public space. This means if your dog is going to get any time off leash, it will be in public space. This doesn't mean dogs are running everywhere, but that parks, woodlands etc will be used by dog owners to exercise off leash. I do my best to be a responsible dog owner and ensure he is under control at all times. We've worked really hard to get to a point where he could walk off leash. Spent over a year using a long line etc. Even put him back on it when he started scavenging a few months back. Although today turned out ok, it could have been worse and I've learnt my lesson about bringing a spare lead. But, DAMN did he impress me. "
301,[help] liquid on dog's bed,dogs,t3_aaj1x5,5,False,False,aaj1x5,"I just came home to my dog after being away for two full days and one night (she was being looked after in our home by my parents, so no change of location), to find...mystery liquid on her bed. It didn't smell like anything, so I am really confused as to what it could be. I'm sure if it was urine it would have smelled like it, and I'm assuming vomit/bile DEFINITELY would have smelled like it. It was enough liquid to where it went through the cover of her bed into the memory foam, and she had on the front of her as well (assuming that she laid in it?). 

She is acting quite guilty (we did not reprimand her at all, I expressed concern in my baby voice and told her that she was okay and that I wasn't mad, so I'm not sure why), but not out of the ordinary. It's not unusual for her to sit and lick her bed, but this seemed like way too much liquid for that to have been the case. She is a 4 year old lab/German Shepherd mix.

How concerned should I be about this? Is it possible she peed on her bed because I was gone, and it just doesn't smell like urine? Is it possible she drank too much water and threw it up and that's why it does not smell like anything?"
302,"[Breed] Help my find my perfect dog breed, please!",dogs,t3_aah97p,5,False,False,aah97p,"**Introduction**

**1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

This is not my first dog. I grew up with German Shepherds, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and Australian Shepherds.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

My family always went through breeders in the past, I like the idea of a rescue dog, I‚Äôm open to either.

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

Here‚Äôs where things get complicated. I teach a lot of theatre/drama/dance to children and would like a ‚Äútheatre dog‚Äù, one that is absolutely great with kids. I‚Äôm a trauma survivor, and a relatively petite sized human, so the idea of a larger dog who might make strangers think twice before approaching sounds ideal. I want a dog that wants to be with me and can jump into my family. Must be trainable and bonus points if I can get this dog to join the kids onstage for shows &lt;3 I also have large birds (Who have been able to hold their own with all previous dogs) so a dog that can quickly learn to leave the birds alone would be safest. (They are never out together unsupervised)

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I like the idea of larger dogs, Rhodesian sized and up, but I‚Äôm not opposed to a dog I can carry if we think, personality wise, it‚Äôll be a better fit. I‚Äôve got a big yard, and a decent sized living space. 

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Obedience for sure, agility could be fun (I did that with my Aussie). A dog that is comfortable with children and activity around without necessarily feeling the need to join in is a great fit. Oh and I love a good hike! 

**Care Commitments**

**6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

I would like to take my dog to work (Theatre) with me and spend a good about of time with my dog. 

**7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

I walk about 1 1/2 hours per day already, could do more. 

**8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

A couple times a week myself, groomers monthly isn‚Äôt out of the question. 

**Personal Preferences**

**9) What size dog are you looking for?**

I love larger dogs, but, again, not opposed to a smaller one if the personality is right.

**10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

The more quiet, the better. Shedding is fine, slobber makes me kind of sad, but I'm willing to put up with it if all else works.

**11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

My dog will always be in secure areas off leash. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

**12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Snuggly please

**13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?**

I‚Äôm open

**14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

I‚Äôm fine with a Dog that is suspicious of door knocking and entering the yard. A protective streak is a good thing in my book. At the theatre it‚Äôs very important that my dog is safe to be around children. 

**15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

No.

**16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?**

As long as I know, I can manage it. 

**Lifestyle**

**17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Rarely.

**18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

Hypoallergenic if possible, for the kids sake, but not totally necessary.

**19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

I have large birds and very senior Australian Shepherd 

**20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Yes, ages 8+

**21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

I own my home 

**22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

Southern CA: not sure of bans.

**23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

It‚Äôs summer year round ;) Summer 90F, Winter 70F

**Additional Information and Questions**

**24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

Thank you!"
303,"[Breeds] So I did the breed questionnaire, and here's my answers",dogs,t3_aagpcl,34,False,False,aagpcl," \*\*Introduction\*\*

3) Describe your ideal dog.  \* A strong, loyal and kind dog that looks like a wolf. Not too tough to handle, but not too easy either.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* SIberian Husky, East/West Siberian Laika, Alaskan Malamute and German Shepherd. They have been my dream dogs for a long time. I love their looks and kind behavior.

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* About 8 hours, possibly 12 but not in a row.

What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* I think I can take my dog for a walk for 1,5 hours twice a day, and that's the only exercise. Dog parks are uncertain since it's usually very small and crowded where I live.  

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* Brushing is the least of my concern, I would definitely do it.  \*\*If I could let a professional do it, sure, but that costs money and I would be better off doing it on my own\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Medium size. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* I don't honestly know that as I have never been in a house with dogs 90% of my life, only cats.  

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* I feel like that is a danger to children that can easily aggravate my dog, I would not do it near them, but neither would I do it in a large, open area without any nearby people to help in case the dog runs away.  \*\*I don't like it when a dog that is aggressive to other people unless there's a good reason, but that's just their nature\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* I don't want to snuggle all the time so I'd go with the latter one unless it becomes seriously aggressive just because I'm near it.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?  \* The one that's more eager to please  

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I would want my dog to be cautious and bark, because if there's a burglar in my backyard then I need to prepare myself and call the police. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* I don't know if I have the strenght since I have never tried before. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?  \* When the dog is more stronger than me and runs away with me on the leash  \*\*I usually play a lot of video games all day, watch movies and go for walks in the evening\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* 7 to 12 hours 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* I haven't asked them, but they prefer cats that require low maintenance  

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* Maybe a cat, but I don't know for sure.  

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* I really want to have children, but since I'm a shy guy and such I don't think that will happen until I'm in my late 20s.  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I may live in an apartment, or just live at home and save up for a house. I would strongly prefer Huskies, Malamutes, Laikas and German Shepherds that are medium sized. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* For safety purposes I won't say my city, but I live in southern Sweden. Hybrids such as Czehcoslovak wolfdogs are legal since the 4th generation is free from wild animal trace or whatever it's called, but you need to take a few lessons in wild animal behavior and breeding.   

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* It's very cold on the winters (-5 celcious and such), and on the summer it is either very hot or very cold.  \*\*Dogs like Huskies will adapt well to the cold climate and can be shaved when needed \*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* No additional information.

304,[Help] My dog does not seem fond of his food anymore?,dogs,t3_aaiea9,1,False,False,aaiea9,"My lab pup is reaching 9 months and for the past couple months, while he does eat his food, he doesn‚Äôt seem as interested in it. 

This is odd, compared to how he used to scruff down all his food in seconds (I had to get him a slow feeder). Now, when I put food in his bowl, he won‚Äôt eat right away and will only eat bits here and there throughout the day so I basically just keep a bowl of food out all day. I do monitor his daily total food intake which is about 4 cups (down from 6 cups).

I know as puppies grow, they require less food and less feedings (I used to feed him 3 times a day)... but is my situation normal or is my dog just getting bored of his food and only eating when he‚Äôs absolutely hungry, should I change it up?

"
305,Situation [Help],dogs,t3_aafl2z,1,False,False,aafl2z," So, I have two dogs, one is a cream retriever (Moses) and one is a french bulldog (Chip) (tremendous size difference obviously). Usually they're best buds, constantly together, play together, sleep together, always by each others sides. Just recently, within the past 3 or 4 days my retriever, the much bigger dog, seems to have become deathly afraid of my french bulldog. Whenever they are both in the house Moses will run away and hide from Chip. He'll cower in a corner or run up to my room and refuse to go downstairs. Moses will be on edge, watching to see if Chip is coming, and if he does, he runs to my side and cries while I pet him. I'm really not sure what to do nor do I really know what started this. Of course they rough house around and maybe Chip had bit him too hard one time but regardless this kind of behavior is very odd for them. This had just caused a general disturbance around the house because we have to be separated with both of them and I personally am a bit afraid to leave them alone together because if Moses gets too afraid, I wouldn't be surprised if he attacked Chip, which, due to the size difference, could end badly. Any help would be greatly appreciated! "
306,[help] I am dogsitting my friend's non-housebroken dog,dogs,t3_aacuuf,5,False,False,aacuuf,"I am dog-sitting my friend's little 5yr old dachshund mix.  I already knew that my friend was not the most responsible with her dog. She leaves him home all day and doesn't have him walked. I have never seen her walk the dog and I used to live next door to her. I also vaguely knew he wasn't completely potty trained. 

This dog is completely NOT housebroken. He's peed on my dog's bed, my bed, my couch, and in my dog's crate. He sees furniture/carpets as places to relieve himself I think. I texted her to ask about the dog's potty skills and she said, ""well you can't leave him loose in a room."" She told me to keep him in his crate which makes me sad.

 I let him run around the yard for a bit, but it's too cold outside for him to stay there and he seems pretty scared of it. He's in his crate, which is more like a carrier container and really, really small.  

I am just about to take him on a walk, but he is really poorly trained and pretty reactive to just about everything. I feel like I just don't know what to do at all. 

To be honest, this is changing my opinion of my friend. Her dog seems pretty neglected and untrained. Last night, she told me it was fine to put him in his crate at 7 pm and take him out at 9 am. That's 14 hours in the crate! 

How do I handle this? she only gave me two pee pads, which I don't think he knows how to use. I guess I will be trying to let him out every hour? I am really at a loss about what to do. "
307,[help] potential partially torn CCL,dogs,t3_aafcxc,3,False,False,aafcxc,"My 5 year old female pit bull has been limping for a month. She has had limps before (extremely active dog/extremely long and strenuous hikes) and x-rays were negative for any breaks or torn ligaments. She usually gets back to 100% within a week. This time she was still favoring her leg after a month. While the limp has improved in the course of a month she would still favor it at times.

&amp;#x200B;

I took her to the vet today and he thinks that it might be a partial ligament tear of her CCL. He gave me Gabapentin and Vetprofen. After reading up on the former, not sure if the side effects are worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

He said that if I wanted to get an x-ray it should be under sedation. I'm reluctant to do this.

  
If it is indeed a partial torn CCL, what is the best course of action? My initial research indicates that surgery, while not necessary, helps to prevent further injury to the knee area. It also helps to prevent potential issues from the change in gait to the other legs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty blown about this because I consider my dog to be invincible physically. She's tough and hardy, never shows signs of being in pain, a sentiment shared by the vet. Like I said before, she is very active and in remarkable shape. I would hate for this limp to be permanent.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with surgery, it doesn't seem like a 100% recovery is possible.

&amp;#x200B;

What have you all seen that gives the best chances of a full recovery from a torn CCL?"

Quick background: I have a litter of 5 Great Dane puppies, 10 days old. They're all hearty little sucklers, and momma dog has been doing a good job thus far. I have been tracking their weights and they're all steadily gaining weight(with an average gain of 1.5lbs in the last week). Now from everything I read they should still have their eyes shut and not be all that mobile, except half of them have opened their eyes today and 2 of them are already holding themselves up completely and walking(not well but definitely walking not crawling). Is this okay?

So I bought children's robitussin dm honey flavor and was going to give her 5ml when she needs it (this is half of the children aged 10-12 dose).

314,[HELP] My dog has a rash on his groin area that looks like roast beef? Wtf is it?,dogs,t3_aah3s3,11,False,False,aah3s3,"Our dog is a Lab and Doberman mix, more lab than anything. He‚Äôs never had a rash before. We recently took him to the vet for a lump he had. We thought it was cancer, but it was just a fatty bump on his leg. He also had a little rash in his groin area. The vet said it was a ring worm and gave us an antibiotic to kill it. He finished that and after the red circle disappeared, he has kept licking at it for a few days.

We grabbed a medicated spray for itchy or hot spots. That didn‚Äôt help. A bath hasn‚Äôt helped. He‚Äôs been licking at it for days now and we‚Äôve never had rash problems before. We did move to a new house with a backyard that he can roam in about 7 or 8 months ago, but this whole situation started maybe 2 weeks ago.

Nothing has changed other than the backyard (again, over 6 or 7 months before the rash). We‚Äôve already spent around $500 at the vet and I‚Äôd prefer not to go back, but he‚Äôs obviously miserable and I don‚Äôt want to be cruel.

The rash started out as reddish and has since begun to look almost like... forgive me... roast beef? It doesn‚Äôt smell, and it‚Äôs not dry. It‚Äôs kind of sticky looking/feeling. He‚Äôs constantly trying to lick it. It‚Äôs right where his balls used to be. Does anyone know what it is or what it sounds like? And for the love of dogs, how to fix it without going to the vet?!

Edit: we took him to the vet this morning. They said that it was a nylon allergy and gave us something to lessen the irritation. The vet told us to buy him a new bed, as well as get rid of our area rug because it can take months for a contact allergy to surface.

319,[UPDATE] My dog has had diarrhea for over 2 weeks.....,dogs,t3_aa63mf,16,False,False,aa63mf,"You can check my history for the previous post. I'm unsure how to link it on mobile.

My 9 1/2 year old bulldog was being treated for IBD after having diarrhea for over 2 weeks, but yesterday she seemed to get really uncomfortable as the day went on. I was going to wait and take her to her regular vet this morning but I couldn't stand to see her in pain and her belly seemed like it was swelling, so we took her to the E-vet.
They did a full panel of blood work, tested her thyroid, and did abdominal xrays to see if they could find anything. He did tell us that the xray showed one of her hips had no cartilage left, so she was likely in quite a but of pain from that (completely unrelated). Her white blood cell count was up so he knew she had some kind of infection which the metrinadozole (prescribed by her regular vet) wasn't helping with. We waited over an hour for a radiologist to look at her xrays because he wanted to be sure before coming to us with any news. It was abnormal, however he couldn't tell us exactly what was wrong. He said it could be cushings, cancer, allergies, or a number of things. He said she needed strong IV antibiotics asap and to be treated quickly because her abdomen was filling with fluid.
IF she made it through that, there would likely be much more extensive testing costing us in the thousands of dollars. We couldn't put her through all of that.
Without an official diagnosis, we faced the incredibly difficult decision to end her suffering. I could tell she was in pain. We went next door to the gas station and bought her a hot dog. She ate it happily with a wagging ""nub"" despite her pain. I held her until her last breath. She was my heart dog. She'd been with my husband and I for 95% of our relationship and 1/3 of my entire life. I don't know how my life will ever be normal again. It was so quiet last night without her snoring or shuffling her blankets around or crawling under the bed so we couldn't nudge her when she snored too loud.....
I am absolutely devastated but am trying to take comfort in the fact that she isn't in any more pain. I loved her so much and will never forget the unconditional love she gave to us.

Every other dog I have owned has been a family dog (a Marmaduke Great Dane, a Rottweiler, a black lab, and a husky mix) all of which (save for the Rottweiler) lived in an apartment with my mother. They were primarily trained by my parents, although I have trained a dog I was babysitting to sit and heal using reward based training with treats.

* 2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? ¬†¬†

&gt;No preference anymore. Initially my preference was to rescue however the application process kept weeding me out because I am young and my backyard isn't fenced in (or so I'm told) so I'm planning to go with a breeder.

* 3) Describe your ideal dog. ¬†¬†

&gt;My ideal dog would be one that can be left home for 4-8 hours of the day. If I need to come home at lunch that's fine, but the 8 hours would be more ideal. On the other hand, the dog has to be smart enough that it can be trained to be off leash for things like hiking, and camping, and playing in the backyard; so high energy as opposed to low energy would also be necessary because I'm looking for an adventure companion for things like: hiking, fishing, camping, skiing (cross country), snowshoeing, kayaking, snowmobiling, four wheeling, etc. Something that is okay with the cold (because I really enjoy winter activities) and the outdoors in general...

* 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? ¬†¬†

&gt;I've been looking at husky, lab, retrievers, Shepherds, and the like... I would really love a mutt though. I was looking at these breeds because they're smart and have a lot of energy, but also because I like the general aesthetic of them and their size.

* 5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? ¬†¬†

&gt;I would like my dog to be able to walk off leash with me, and ring a bell when it goes outside. Being able to run and wrestle and play with him/her without aggression is ideal as well... and of course, coming when their name is called. Honestly, if I could teach him/her to push a button to come in and out of the outdoors, I wouldn't feel so bad about leaving it at home while I'm at work.

&amp;#x200B;

**Care Commitments**

* 6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? ¬†¬†

&gt;Ideally I would spend about 20 minutes outside with him in the morning before I leave for work, and then a few hours after dinner. On the weekends of course I can devote more time, and considering I would like to take him hiking and such, the more time the merrier at that point, but I'd need to be able to spend less time with them on the weekdays

* 7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? ¬†¬†

&gt;Let's say about 2 to 3 hours. This could be anything from running around and playing in the backyard with them, throwing sticks, or going on hikes and other such activities

* 8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? ¬†¬†

&gt;For brushing, every other day would be ideal to give myself a break in between, but I'm willing to do maintenance like nail trimming and cleaning, however fur trimming I would take them to a groomer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Preferences**

* 9)	What size dog are you looking for? ¬†¬†

&gt;Medium to large. I was looking at a Pyrenees for a little while but perhaps 3 x 40lb bags of food a month is a bit much (that's my only concern with a larger dog)

* 10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? ¬†¬†

&gt;I can handle lots of shedding and barking... not so much slobber. Slobber is okay outside in the heat, but not so much in the air conditioned house. Our great dane was constantly slobbering and would shake his head and get slobber all over the walls and ceiling, I'm not sure I could go through that again...

* 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? ¬†¬†

&gt;Very important (of the utmost)

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

* 12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? ¬†¬†

&gt;No preference although they won't be allowed to sleep with me in bed, or cuddle with me on the couch so probably less snugly...

* 13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please? ¬†¬†

&gt;Honestly I want both. One that's willing to spend time with me and happy to do so, but that can also be left alone at home... I know that's a tough one... if I had to choose, then I suppose one that's willing to do it's own thing so that it isn't miserable at home while I'm at work...

* 14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? ¬†

&gt;I would like them to bark to let me know there's someone there, and to maybe scare off potential intruders, but otherwise I think it's fairly necessary that they are cautious with strangers but friendly...

* 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? ¬†¬†

&gt;Honestly, aggression is the one thing I can't handle.

* 16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid? ¬†¬†

&gt;I of course would like to avoid separation anxiety but I can manage it. The only thing I can't deal with is aggressive and possessive behaviors (that is, if I try to take something from it's mouth, I don't want it snarling and biting at me)

**Lifestyle**

* 17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? ¬†¬†

&gt;Weekly anywhere between 4 to 8 hours, weekends barely ever.

* 18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? ¬†¬†

&gt;My spouse has basically the same preferences as me, and we will have equal involvement in caring for the dog. Sometimes I might take the dog out in the morning, sometimes he might, etc.

* 19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? ¬†¬†

&gt;I don't have any pets and I don't plan on getting any other pets other than perhaps another dog to keep each other company when I'm away.

* 20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? ¬†¬†

&gt;No

* 21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? ¬†¬†

&gt;I rent currently, probably for about another year or so but there are no restrictions in the lease and my landlord has given me the go-ahead for whatever type of dog I wish, as long as I can clean up after it.

* 22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? ¬†¬†

&gt;Canada, Ontario, I believe there is a current ban on pit-bulls and similar breeds.

* 23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? ¬†¬†

&gt;Summer: 25 Celsius, Winter: -20 up to -40 Celsius

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Information and Questions**

* 24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. ¬†¬†

&gt;In order of preference and more simplistically my requirements would probably go as such: not aggressive, intelligent (to be trained off leash), size (medium to large), high energy for adventures but self sufficient when left alone while I'm at work. It might be good to note that I live on the outskirts of town, a non-busy street, and I have 3 acres in my backyard that leads into some forest.

* 25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

324,Headstrong vs. Eager to Please [Discussion],dogs,t3_aad4np,29,False,False,aad4np,"So just sort of an open discussion pertaining to something I'm a bit curious about.

It seems that most people prefer eager to please dogs, which is understandable for novice dog owners who aren't prepared to deal with a headstrong dog, but any thoughts on this trend in general? I find that I prefer headstrong dogs that are, ie. Huskies, Akitas, etc. I personally find it much more rewarding to have a dog that can think for itself and make decisions accordingly (worded poorly, every animal thinks for itself naturally. Re. I find it rewarding to find out what creative or specific motivator these dogs have in order to encourage them to learn commands), opposed to dogs who strive only to please their owner. I find that often times headstrong dogs become fairly reliable in responding to commands as their trust and loyalty is earned and reciprocated, which is all the better. Any different views on this or just stories of your pups in general in regards to this?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I worded this veryyy poorly, apologies for that! This isn't insulting eager to please dogs(or biddable, as someone kindly suggested instead. Which does make more sense) as they make up the better majority of working and sporting dogs. I fear for the day someone tries to turn my husky into a service dog lol. They're vital to numerous fields and activities and just as respectable. My statement was more or less as a matter of personal preference, as someone who does not need a working or sporting dog, but more or less a companion. The intelligent bit was also misguided at best, as others have pointed out, how biddable a dog is wouldn't determine how intelligent they are. I posted this with the intention of learning more on the subject and I'm attempting to somewhat update this post as I learn. :) Don't know the rules on linking articles in this, but u/shiplesp linked a great article on the subject!

As for our dog, he recently received a clean bill of health! He‚Äôs still not back to his normal self but we hope that will come with time.

326,[discussion] subscription box for dogs,dogs,t3_aagb44,15,False,False,aagb44,"Good evening dog lovers!

I am creating a subscription box for dogs and am looking for some advice or opinions from the very people who buy them! 

Based on the current available boxes for dogs. What could be improved upon? What would be something really useful, fun or interesting you'd like to see in the box? 

Is there anything you feel is missing from the current market? 

Is there something you do not like about the current boxes (be specific) why and how could this be improved? 

What if there were better options (more personability for the dog) 

Would you like to see clothing articles in the box? Collars, scarves, costumes? 

Could the box itself be improved in some way? 

Would you like to see different products variation in the box (rather than 1 toy, 2 treat bags and 2 chews?)

Deals with other dogs businesses for being subscribed? 

I can go on forever with questions but that's why I'm writing here! Please give me your honest opinions on the current market, what it's lacking, what it's doing well and how if it could be improved upon! Anything and everything you can give me will be greatly appreciated and maybe you'll see those changes happen in the upcoming box I'm creating.

327,"[help] sister got a dog over christmas from her MIL, sister thinks the dog is a pitbull which is illegal where they live. need help determining the breed",dogs,t3_aa8aht,60,False,False,aa8aht,"as title says ^ my sister got a surprise present from her mother in law over christmas, a brand new puppy. which wouldnt be that bad if my sister had any idea of the background of the dog, but her MIL only has extremely limited information. she told my sister that she found the puppy off of craigslist and messaged the number listed, and they talked and he said that the breed was a ‚Äúmini aussie mixed border collie‚Äù and then sent pictures of both parents and the puppy itself, with no further information except that the puppy was around 7 weeks old (an obvious lie.) when he had come over to give her the dog he insisted he had to leave almost immediately after coming and getting the money, only saying that the dog could eat solid food before leaving (but not actually providing anything himself)

so here‚Äôs the real kicker: after my sister found out about this she was obviously upset at her MIL for not only buying a dog but without talking to her about it first; so she tried to contact the same number to get more information, but the number was completely cut almost like he disappeared off the face of the earth. she figured it was because of the age as the dog was obviously not 6 weeks and was a lot younger, but as the dog is getting older now she‚Äôs starting to get very suspicious that the breed is also a reason he‚Äôs no longer communicating. 

[here](https://imgur.com/gallery/zOqo526) are some pics. in order: the picture of the puppy sent by him, the pictures of the parents, and the puppy now. my sister said she‚Äôs slightly worried now that it might actually be a pitbull puppy, since pitbulls are illegal in denver. we‚Äôre not sure why anyone would sell a different breed than listed but we can only chalk it up to christmas madness. but please any help determining the breed at all is greatly appreciated we could really use any help we can get (or a redirect if this isnt the right place to post about this. thanks!)

TL;DR sisters MIL bought her a dog over christmas from shady craigslist ad, sister is furious and tries to get more info, number is now cut and sister is suspicious of the dog actually being a pitbull (illegal in denver) instead of the listed breed "
328,"[Discussion] [Update] I rescued three dogs, but a fourth was kept in inhumane conditions.",dogs,t3_aaahvl,14,False,False,aaahvl,"You may remember my post, or maybe not. About two months ago I rescued three dogs, Olive (mom, mini poodle) Boris &amp; Doris (son/daughter poodle x chihuahua). My coworkers mother was keeping these three tiny dogs outside in a shed. They'd been there for their whole lives (2-5 years) and had no medical treatment ever. 

I took them on the condition that they were her only dogs, ie ill fix your problem for you but I'm taking them all (her mom wanted to keep one, I know they're her dogs but you don't get to treat animals like that and then keep them, in my opinion). 

These dogs are the best dogs I've ever had, excluding my heart dog. I've rescued a lot of dogs, but Ive never met such sweet, smart dogs. They're so great. I just found out that she kept one back, their brother who was ""cute"". 

He lived outside, and since I took the others they put him inside. He stays in a crate 23 hours a day. I'm livid. Luckily, my coworker told me because her mother was wanting to get rid of him. I told her to bring him to me. 

I can't believe this. It kills me. I know it's weird, but I view him as *my* dog. I have his mother and littermates. They sleep in my bed, and when they go in a crate its only for a few hours. They have toys, great food, and lots of love. And he's suffering. I have spent hundreds of dollars on their care, and I agreed to do it because I was rescuing *all* of them. 

I can't stand the thought of him suffering. I hope they bring him soon. It was pretty tough to get the other three brought to me, I don't know why obviously they don't like dogs much.

330,[Help] Info on the relationship between puppy tolerance of restraint and resource guarding thresholds,dogs,t3_aabu8y,5,False,False,aabu8y,"I found an article about Resource Guarding (RG), located here as a PDF: https://www.gths.ca/wp-content/uploads/Article-Resource-Guarding-Dec-2-2014.pdf. 

The article discusses early signs of a low RG threshold. In particular interest to me is the following, emphasis added:

&gt;These signs are often overlooked because for the most part these behaviours are normal; puppies need to learn tolerance to body handling, restraint, etc. **However, in the case of a puppy with a low resource guarding threshold these behaviours are more pronounced and approach the excessive end of the scale.**

This article is the only one that I can find that correlates puppy unwillingness to be restrained with a low RG threshold. I want to find more information about this relationship. 

I emailed the author but she is very busy and told me to look into Jean Donaldson's book ""Mine!"" and Steven R. Lindsay‚Äôs text series volume 2, which I guess is ""Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Vol. 2: Etiology and Assessment of Behavior Problems"".  

I've read ""Mine!"" and don't remember the relationship being discussed. I downloaded the Lindsay book and ""resource guarding"" doesn't appear in the text at all, but he does say this at the beginning of the aggression chapter: 

&gt; Although most dogs are presented for treatment at 1 to 3 years of age, incipient signs of a developing problem are frequently observed in young puppies, often prior to 4 months of age.

Skimming the rest of the aggression chapter, I don't see anything else similar to what I'm looking for, but lots of great information on ""low threshold"" as it relates to aggression in general. I can draw the implicit connections between what I'm reading and what I'm looking for, but am seeking more explicit info.

Anyone know of any material that explores the relationship between puppy restraint tolerance and low RG thresholds further? "

334,[HELP] Looking for alternative to dog park.,dogs,t3_aabfik,32,False,False,aabfik,"This happened yesterday, however I just puked stressing about it this morning.

I got home before sundown yesterday. Not something that typically happens, so I decided to reward myself and treat my dog, ‚ÄúDaisy‚Äù, to an afternoon at the dog park. Daisy sits next to me in my truck and becomes visibly more excited as we near the park. It‚Äôs easily her favorite place in the world. As I park, Daisy starts to ‚Äúpush‚Äù me towards the door. As we walk towards the dog run, she wants to pull me faster, but she does her best not to, all the way to the gate. I bring her into the buffer pen, take off her leash, and open the gate.

Immediately she started having fun.
Daisy went and said ‚Äúhi‚Äù to every dog and half the people in the pen. Three black labs and a beagle start to chase her as she runs around the pen. The owner of the beagle begins to shout at his dog, because anytime it catches up to Daisy, it starts eating her ass. Daisy doesn‚Äôt seem to notice the beagle or any of the other dogs chasing her. She only has eyes for the brown lab on the other side of the fence. She barks, wags her tail and try‚Äôs to get the brown lab to run up and down the fence with her, (Daisy‚Äôs favorite game). After a few minutes, the beagle owner is tired of watching his dog give mine a rim job and puts his leash on and drags him towards the gate to leave. A married couple decided to leave as well and put their two black labs on leashes and start walking to the gate. Daisy then takes notice of the labs and approaches them to investigate.

Daisy got too close for comfort to one of the labs. It snapped and bit repeatably, lunged against the leash and tried pinning Daisy to he ground by her neck. The woman panicked, pulling on the leash and fell onto her back. Daisy stayed low and backed up, retreating without taking her eyes off the lab. Momentary chaos as everyone grabs their dogs, breaking up the fur pile the commotion attracted.

The woman quickly gets back on her feet, fire-engine red in the face, wild-eyed and unloads a flurry of curses at Daisy and I. She screams that she is going to kill my dog, that she is going to wring her by the neck, that all pit-bulls are no good and should be exterminated. The husband chimes in and says that my dog is no good, to get it out of the park and shoot it.
I‚Äôm a little in shock, the only thing I can think to say is, ‚ÄúAre you seriously talking to me?‚Äù The husband confirms that, yes, he is talking to me. I immediately retort, ‚ÄúYour dog attacked mine!‚Äù The woman exclaimed that she was afraid for her poor baby and she thought she was going to get her face ripped off. I looked at her dog, then back to Daisy, ‚ÄúIs your dog bleeding? Because mine is!‚Äù Daisy had small puncture wounds on the top of her head, right side of her face, and the nape of her neck. The woman protested that her dog was wounded too. But after looking her dog over, could not find a scratch on him. I explained that her dog felt threatened when Daisy approached and because her dog was leashed and couldn‚Äôt run away, defended itself and her. Another dog owner came to our defense and even berated the woman for leashing her dogs in the pen.

At this point the woman began to calm down and apologized profusely while shaking my hand. She explained that her dog is her ‚Äúchild‚Äù, that she was scared for her ‚Äúbaby‚Äù and that she was so scared that she wet herself, and that‚Äôs why she overreacted. I try not to react as I realize why her handshake was so moist. I didn‚Äôt want to upset her after making so much progress de-escalating the situation. I told her I understood why she was scared and why she reacted the way she did as she shook my hand again. The woman then apologized to the parents in the park for her outburst in front of their small children. She assured me that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all good‚Äù as she and her husband left the park.

I‚Äôm still holding on to Daisy‚Äôs collar as I consider leaving the park myself. I ask all the other patrons if they are ok with Daisy and I staying. They assured me that Daisy was fine to stay and that woman and her husband were out of line. I let Daisy go and watch carefully as she plays with three other dogs, sniffs at a five year old boy then licks a girl of about ten as she gets petted. I start coming down off the adrenaline as I wash my hands and everyone else relaxes and goes back to watches their dogs play. About an hour goes by before a police officer shows up. The officer approaches the fence and I walk up to meet her. The officer asked if everyone was ok. I told her everyone was ok. She asked a couple of questions and I did my best to explain what happened. One of the other dog handlers comes up to us and confirmed my story, adding, ‚ÄúThat bitch was drunk and acting crazy before his dog showed up.‚Äù The officer‚Äôs response was something to the effect of ‚ÄúI figured there was another side to this.‚Äù After asking again if everyone was ok, the officer left. Thirty minutes later, the sun dipped into the horizon and I took Daisy home.

I‚Äôm seriously considering swearing off dog parks all together. This is the third time Daisy has been attacked by another dog then blamed because she is half pit. The second time the cops have been called, (the first time was because she got loose in the neighborhood for 10 minutes). And the third time someone has threatened killing my dog for being a vicious attack animal that needs to be made extinct.! /s
Oh, and this is the only incident that involved all three scenarios!

This will be a non issue soon. I‚Äôm going to buy some land next year, put a trailer on it, and build my dream home away from the city.
Should I just keep my dog away from the parks till then? What are some other options?


TL;DR I took my dog to the park. My dog gets bit, then threatened with  genocide, and I get pee on me. Cops get called."
335,[Help] Younger Dog attacked Older Dog,dogs,t3_aac7x7,0,False,False,aac7x7,"I wanted to get input on a sitatuation that happened a while ago with my 2 years old (at the time) Bernese/Lab cross. We got her as a pup and she ended up with parvo the next day. We spent weeks and tons of time and money and she survived it. Due to complications she ended up getting vaccinated later on and training took longer as well as socializing. From a pup she lived with our 10 year old lab (most pleasant dog). They never had a problem with eachother other than the occassional snarls from the lab to get puppy to back off. Fast forward a year, my bfs golden and my bernese are best friends, tons of play dates, etc. Now she is particular about certain dogs, so we always have her on leash for her safety and other dogs, don't take her to off leash, etc but she still gets walked 2-3 times a day and what not.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, when my mom and I were home alone eating sushi, our then 12 year old lab was begging for food. My mom turned to her and said 'nope, out, stop begging!'. All of the sudden the then 2 year old Bernese out of nowhere attacked the older dog. Grabbed the scruff of her neck and shook and growled. We were able to seperate them and get 2 year old outside but were a bit shook. After everything had calmed down, we let her back in and she was acting weird. Older dog would be in a room and she would sit at edge of room staring at her etc. I went to see older dog to see how she was doing and again, pup attacked her. I ended up getting bit in the process. Now, we seperated them after that as we have a basement appartment so pup was down there and older still had run of the house and always basket muzzled pup when they were together. Even with the muzzle, pup would sometimes lunge and growl at her for no reason. We got both checked at vet, pup was fine, older one had some health issues and passed a month later.

&amp;#x200B;

I continuously play this whole thing in my head wondering what had happened. I live with my fiance now and the Bernese (4 years old now) and a golden (3 years) who are best friends. Sleep together, play together, everything.. I was wondering if anyone has any insight on this? Our vet didn't really seem to think much of it but it has always bothered me that it was so sudden this turn.

I knew it before going in. We‚Äôve been on borrowed time ever since you collapsed 2 years ago. They put you on meds, a few weeks of crate rest. We bought you an orthopedic gel bed.

Not moving as much, not the happy confident dog you once were. Back to the vet. They tried medicine for nerve pain which seemed to help somewhat, along with the cocktail of anti-inflammatoires and pain meds. You took your medicine dutifully as long as it was hidden in a tiny piece of salami (food is life for you). Things seemed ok, we thought it was just part of getting old. We celebrated your tenth birthday. Your muzzle was getting gray. 

A few weeks go we realized the meds weren‚Äôt really helping anymore. The anti-inflammatoires gave you bloody diarrhea so we had to stop them. You would be up and down all night trying to find a position comfortable enough to sleep. More pain medicine. You had a hard time getting in and out of bed. In the evenings you would sit next to me and cry from the pain. You stopped playing with your toys. You stopped asking to go potty and peed in the house - this would have been unimaginable before, you were so great at being potty-trained. The gabapentin combined with less movement made you gain weight. We put you on a pretty strict diet and you were just. so. miserable.  Your eyes were sad and dull.    

After considering all the details for the euthanasia options we decided to have it done at the vet‚Äôs instead of at home, and donate the difference to our local shelter in your memory. The company I work for matched our donation. The shelter was so thankful.  We then decided to donate every year on your anniversary.    

It took me 5 days to call the pet hospital back and schedule the procedure. I cried after I hung up, and every day since. You were my best and most loyal friend since the day I brought you home. I felt so damned guilty and helpless.    

For your last week we brought home all the dog treats you love most. All the progress you made on your diet went to hell as you happily munched away. We brought you to the park so you could sniff around your old stomping grounds as much as you wanted. You did pretty good with the walking, I have to say. It‚Äôs like you knew these were your last walks and you were determined to enjoy them.    

Last night you cuddled with me, licking my arm and hand, laying your head on me and looking up pretty intently with your one brown eye and one blue eye. You hadn‚Äôt done that in ages. I figured out at that moment that you were saying goodbye and thank you. I kissed your head all over and breathed in your doggy smell, told you I loved you and you were the best boy.    

Tonight we made clay paw prints as keepsakes. You didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. I put away your fancy bed, since you‚Äôre sleeping in the teenage boy‚Äôs bed tonight. It‚Äôll be a while before I‚Äôll be able to look at it. The teenager decided that your last meal tomorrow would be chicken McNuggets since you‚Äôve never tasted them and he thinks you‚Äôd enjoy a few.    

Tomorrow morning I‚Äôll bring you out walking one last time to enjoy the sun and fresh air. Then we‚Äôll have your last meal all together for lunch, and the appointment is at 2pm. Your whole family will be there with you as you depart. I already asked my dad to watch over you in heaven.    

This time tomorrow night, you won‚Äôt be here anymore. I‚Äôm dreading the emptiness and worried sick about how the teenager who grew up with you will be taking it. My sole comfort is knowing that you will finally be pain-free; I‚Äôd much rather suffer in my grief than watch you suffer from all the physical pain.

The dog is create trained and has no issues holding it for hours in the crate. But when out of the crate, we will let him out every 1-2 hours, and he will come back inside after peeing/pooping outside and pee/poop inside. 

We have done positive reinforcement, treats, wait outside until he uses the restroom, take up food between eating, and keep on a schedule of 1-2 hour let outs.

An issue seems to be, we can‚Äôt always get him to let us know when he needs to go out. When we are in the bedroom, where his crate is, he will whine to have us let him out(when he is outside of the crate), but when we are in the living room/basement he will not whine. So if he is out in these spaces, we are always watching but he still manages to sneak away and use the restroom- between the let outs or right after he gets back in. We have cleaned the carpets to try and get rid of any scent, use proper cleaning products for all accidents, but can‚Äôt seem to get him to stop. 

We can go days with no accident, but are not able to keep it consistent. I‚Äôm not sure what else to do, to get him to tell us in the other living spaces and to keep him from going inside. I am not sure if it‚Äôs just his little bladder- he is only 10 pounds- but he holds it in his crate, or if it‚Äôs because he is doing it out of anger/spite.

343,[Help] Advice on what I can do to entertain my two under-stimulated dogs.,dogs,t3_aaeqgk,5,False,False,aaeqgk,"Currently me and my two sweet boys aren't in the most ideal of living situations. Luckily this is only temporary, but I'd still like advice for the meantime. I have two dogs one is an Alaskan Husky (aka sled dog) who is, as you can imagine, very high energy. My other pup is an American Staffordshire terrier, who loves being outside, and chewing just about anything. 

Right now we're living in an apartment thanks to the house rental prices here in Washington. I take them on walks during the day, but they are short walks because I am currently five months pregnant, and they're big dogs with totally different opinions on which directions they should go. 

This is the first time in their lives I haven't been able to provide them with a yard. I can tell they're bored as they are sleeping all day. I have a toy box for them with chew toys, but they are bored of those as well. I can't bring them to a dog park because my Staffordshire is so high energy around other dogs (not aggressive just hyper) that I've had issues with other dogs reacting badly. He's much better meeting new dogs one on one. 

If I had the funds to hire someone to take them on walks for me I absolutely would, but paying someone daily to take them on a long walk is out of our budget for at least two more months. My fiance works until late in the day and I work from home so their quality of life is my duty right now. 

So to my point! Sorry for the long intro. I am planning on using my Christmas money to buy them some stimulating toys but they are two very different dogs with different likes. My Staffordshire loves to chew and tear apart squeaky toys, my Alaskan Husky hates squeaky toys and only likes chew toys for playing the keep away game. What are some recommendations you guys have for stimulating toys and activities we can do in the house?"
344,[help] My dog has randomly changed his behaviour,dogs,t3_aabamc,13,False,False,aabamc,"So I have had my dog for around 2 and a half years and he has always been a really good dog. He was an abandoned puppy when we got him. He is an American Staffordshire mixed with something else. We live in Belgium.

He has always been kind to humans and other dogs, everyone in our neighborhood always comments on how nice of a dog he is and how kind he is. He has never barked at another dog while on the lease or been aggressive towards them during the 2 years and a half we had him.

Apparently 3 days ago my dad was letting him out in our garden (no fence) and he saw this one specific dog and just went nuts after him and started attacking him. My dad was luckily able to stop our dog before one of them got hurt and we got of with a scare.

Luckily the owner of the other dog understood our situation and we were lucky that nothing grave happened.

Today while playing ball with my dog he saw the other dog again and even after me pinning him down he went after the other dog, he ignored me shouting ect.

I was able to get him off the other dog before he did anything to the poor dog. He hurt himself while doing this and I'm really scared that my dog has become aggressive towards other dogs and is now an actual threat towards dogs or even potentially humans.

I wanted to ask you guys what I should do now, should I contact a dog specialist to retrain his behaviour towards other dogs, should we put a fence in the garden so he can't run out on the street again?

I really don't know what to do with my dog as I have a feeling that I can't trust him anymore when there are other people or dogs in the area.

347,"[Help] My dog has Giardia, are these symptoms normal? Please help!",dogs,t3_aae9fp,2,False,False,aae9fp,"Hello. My 12 year-old Lhasa Apso has been diagnosed with Giardia. He's my family dog, so he lives with my mom and I'm not living with them anymore. My mom took him to the vet because he was throwing up and not eating his food. The vet thought it was a problem with his teeth and advised her to soften his food by putting it in broth. They did a blood test on him to check his vitals and said everything looked good. However he continued to throw up and I was getting worried, so I took him to the vet. They did x rays and a fecal exam. The x rays showed he was slightly constipated, but were generally normal. The next day they called my mom up and told her he has something called Giardia. They told us to give him this powdered medicine (I can't remember what it's called) once a day for three days and give him 10 mg of omeprazole twice a day. They also advised us to keep him on a bland diet of rice and boiled skinless, boneless chicken. We followed everything and he stopped throwing up, however he also stopped pooping. Since he hadn't thrown up in four days and we were done with the powdered medicine we tried giving him normal food again. He ended up pooping which is good, but my sister told me he has thrown up yellowish-whitish foam three times since last night. It's really hard because I'm across the country right now so I can't take care of him. I made another (third one) vet appointment for him today. On the phone, the vet said we might consider doing an ultrasound. It would cost $450 which is really a lot for me. Even though he's my family dog, nobody else in the family really cares enough to pay that sort of money for him so it all comes down to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever had a dog have Giardia? Did they experience similar symptoms? How long did they last? Did you end up having to do an ultrasound? Any help on this issue would be much appreciated as I'm extremely stressed out right now. Thank you."

354,[HELP] Best dog breeds for home protection?,dogs,t3_aabbxm,83,False,False,aabbxm,"I'm looking for a dog breed or possibly breeds if they get a along well enough that are amazing for home protection.

I'm fully capable of looking after such a dog, have enough space for it and grew up around protective herding dogs, the kind that don't like strangers or allow them to come near.

So don't worry about any of that, I wouldn't be asking on here were I not prepared or capable.

That being said I now live in a suburban area, a couple years ago a house I used to live in was broken into while I was home, it was a scary experience, luckily the guy was alone and not carrying any weapons, he ran off as soon as he knew I was home.

That being said the experience has left me with the want for guard dogs.

Ideally I would like the dogs to ward off the criminal rather than any altercation actually happen between them however I need a breed that when push comes to shove they won't back down.

I have a pregnant wife atm and have thier safety and mine in mind.

Also, before anybody says it, I'm not an idiot, I know dogs aren't unstoppable and I don't expect them to be able to stop any and all threats that they may encounter, however 3 well trained gaurd dogs would definitley make me feel a whole lot safer to said potential threats.

With that paragraph attempting to serve as background, we went on vacation over Labor Day weekend.  Since then, he licks himself a lot more often.

He licks both his front side and his backside, but I've also noticed him getting the top of his paws and parts of his hind legs.  I've also seen him lick the sheets or my feet.

My 8yo male Jack Russell got a suspected grass seed in his foot last Weds (19th Dec) we took him to the vet they knocked him out cut into his foot and found nothing and put him on a course of antibiotics (Amoxyclav 5mg). 

We finished the course and still no seed but his foot wasn‚Äôt getting better. We had to put down our cat on Xmas Eve night due to a suspected snake bite which was missed the first time and he was sent home after a day, we took him to the vet after hours and had to do the same Xmas eve to be told it may or may not be a snake bite, he needs a transfusion which is 50/50 chance of killing him and if not it could be eating a rat that had been poisoned or cancer so we put our poor old mate to sleep and had a rough Christmas.


So due to that fact we thought we‚Äôd take Baxter to another vet for a second opinion as we found he hasn‚Äôt been right since going under general anaesthetic the first time and didn‚Äôt want to put him through that again.


The vet saw him and seemed really thorough and we were happy with him.
He prescribed another form of antibiotics (Cephalexin 200mg) and some anti-inflammatories (Previcox 57mg) and Silica 6x which he claimed if we were patient would bring the seed to the surface in anywhere from 7-10 days to 6 months.


Now I‚Äôm fairly sceptical guy and he didn‚Äôt specifically say it was homeopathic but I suspected it was and confirmed it when I researched it when I got home.


So my question is, is my new vet a kook who believes in Homeopathy or did he give us, the owners a placebo so it didn‚Äôt feel like he was doing nothing by telling us to sit and the body will expel it?


I don‚Äôt believe in homeopathy and believe science has thoroughly disproved its effectiveness.

I‚Äôve given him the Cephalexin and Previcox as prescribed but not given him the Silica 6x which from I can tell is just a sugar pill.

He is with me for 4 days. The first 2 days went good, he struggled just during the night, sleeping 5 hours and then starting pacing around the house. 
During the day everything was fine and we went to long walks. 

Today (the 3rd day) he definitely got worse.
He sleep like 3 hours and then started pacing around the house hitting his head on every wall and forniture (with the lights on). He eat just a little bit of boiled chicken. 

He totally has all the symptoms of dog dementia: paces in circles, remains blocked under fortnitures, staring at walls, looks disoriented, can‚Äôt chew properly and can‚Äôt put his head in the water bowl, loosing his balance ecc.. (he looks drunk)

His parents literally didn‚Äôt tell me anything about this situation.  I sent them video of today‚Äôs behavior and they told me that sometimes it happens.  That he has highs and lows. 

I‚Äôm worried because i don‚Äôt know how to help him, he‚Äôs hitting his head a lot (today he looks blind) on my walls because obviously this is a new environment for him. 

I was told that he spend the day on his dog bed, and when i met him the first time he was in fact very calm. 

I‚Äôm a little bit anxious because caring for a doggie like this is something for experts and he shouldn‚Äôt leave his comfort zone in this situation. 
I told them that mine is a passion and that i know how to deal with dogs because i had doggies, but i am not not an expert. 

I knew his age, but i already cared for elderly dogs, so i was confident about this. 
However i honestly never seen dog dementia. He‚Äôs being psychologically distruttive for himself and my family and i do not have the skills for this. 

I‚Äôm fortunately keeping him hydrated, but i‚Äôm worried because he ate very few and he won‚Äôt stop having compulsive pacing behavior (he could even hurt himself). 

I‚Äôm super stressed, i can‚Äôt have second for me, even for the toilet and no sleep because he restless paces all night and day. 

I was not looking for something like this.  I wanted to look for a normal pet, have fun and care for him, i didn‚Äôt want a medical-behavioral job.  
I also needed 3/4 hours per day to work with my pc, and i obviously can‚Äôt.

362,[Help] Having a tough time finding a new brand of dry food for my dog with DCM. Here are my thoughts and some brands I am considering. Please steer me in the right direction!,dogs,t3_aa5zvr,19,False,False,aa5zvr,"A few weeks ago I learned that my dog has an enlarged heart. Since then I have been trying to learn all I can about the potential connection between diet and DCM. I have been reading all the related peer-reviewed articles and studies, and compiled a list of ingredients to avoid and ingredients to watch out for. 


It's been very challenging finding a brand or formula that does not contain those ingredients. In addition there are so many factors outside of ingredients to take into account! Like how the companies process the ingredients (i.e. thermal processing could lead to reduced taurine available for absorption) which isn't readily available information. Even ingredient interaction could still play a role in DCM and ingredients that may be toxic but not yet identified.


**I will try to summarize the options I am considering but I would really appreciate some help!** Note that my dog is a shih-tzu in her senior years. She has been eating Orijen Senior kibbles for the last 6 years or more.

***

# 1) Purina Pro Plan
Highly recommended in this sub due to the company's lengthy history, feeding trials and large number of veterinarians on staff. 

However, I found this [article](https://truthaboutpetfood.com/pet-foods-customer-service/) regarding a customer finding flakes of aluminum in a Pro Plan chicken formula. Is this something I should be concerned about?

Here are the 3 formulas that seem to suit my dog the best:

**Pro Plan Sensitive Skin and Stomach Salmon and Rice Formula**

* This diet is listed on Tuft's list of low sodium dog foods which is great for dogs with heart disease!

* In an article from AVMA it seems like this formula contains ingredients that they define as part of a ""BEG diet: (Boutique, Exotic-ingredient, and Grain-free): salmon and barley. 

* Salmon isn't really talked about in the articles/studies I've read (unlike lamb formulas that have been linked to taurine deficiency). They just categorize it as ""exotic."" Salmon may not be an issue I think?

* Barley, on the other hand, has lead to lower concentrations of taurine in dogs according to a 2003 NCBI study. 

**Pro Plan Small Breed Formula**

* Contains barley (see above)

**Pro Plan Shredded Chicken and Rice Formula**

* Soybeans is listed in the FDA investigation as an example of legumes. This formula contains soybean meal. 

##Pro Plan TL;DR: I love the fact the company conducts feeding trials and has a big staff of vets, but worried about ingredient quality/sourcing (i.e. article about metal flakes in kibbles). ""Small Breed"" and ""Salmon &amp; Rice"" formulas seem great except for barley. Though I am not too concerned because barley is more of an ingredient to watch out for instead of outright avoiding like legumes, peas, potatoes, etc.

***

# 2) BALANCE IT

This option requires a little more effort but I like the idea of using healthy ingredients that I already have (chicken thighs, broccoli, oatmeal, etc.). It involves weighing out proportions, cooking, and adding a supplement to ensure my dog gets all her nutrients.

My main concern was how legit this company is and the quality/safety of their supplement. It appears as though the founder is a certified nutritionist from UC Davis. I also see this company mentioned by the WSAVA which is reassuring. 

Any thoughts about them? I don't see many mentions on /r/dogs but maybe it's due to how time-consuming it is to prep home-cooked dog food?

##TD;LR I completely control the ingredients but it can be a bit time-consuming. Main issues: prep time and supplement quality.

***

# 3) SMALLER DOG FOOD COMPANIES

This could potentially be referred to as the ""boutique companies"" which have been connected to DCM. It also means they don't have the history behind their products, and likely don't conduct feeding trials or have vets on staff. Another downside (though minor in comparison) is most of these products require shipping to Canada.

The main positive is that I have found some formulas that contain none of the problematic ingredients. For example ""Frenchie's Kitchen"" chicken formula. Other companies whose formulas I like include ""Primal"" and ""Dogs For The Earth."" I believe these three companies are public about the source of all their ingredients which is reassuring. Feel free to recommend me others.

However, I really don't want to fall for marketing again (which lured me to Orijen's grain-free in the first place). 

##TL;DR Quality ingredients, no ingredients connected to DCM, but companies likely do not conduct feeding trials or have vets on staff."

364,[HELP] How to pad train my rescue? Plus a few other questions!,dogs,t3_aa9n4x,5,False,False,aa9n4x,"I adopted a dog from the humane society last week. She is so loving and cuddly and I love her so much already. 

I want to pad train her for when I am at work. Currently she is crated but I think other than the potty issue she is a good enough girl to be out. 
Here is where I run into an issue; with a puppy I would just keep her on the pad until she pees and praise her since they pee so frequently. However Midge is two years old. She goes hours between going potty. I can‚Äôt keep her on the pad for more than a few minutes because she lays down and I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôll learn it‚Äôs just another place to nap rather than potty. She also does not know what ‚Äúpotty‚Äù means, so I can‚Äôt just tell her to go potty. Any suggestions??

My next question is how do I teach her to play? She has no interest in fetch or tugging and I would really like a way to get out her energy on rainy days. 

Also, Midge is really gassy and it smells BAD. and she poops a lot. Not as in frequency but volume. Could this be a food brand issue or a take her to the vet issue?

Sorry for all the questions, I‚Äôve always had dogs but I‚Äôve always adopted a puppy so adopting an older dog kinda threw me for a loop!
Thanks in advance!

My fellow dog loving redditors, I'm sure you've all been in that situation where someone gives your dog a treat without asking you first.

If you're that person feeding other dogs... Stop. Stop right now. You wouldn't feed someone's child right?

Speaking from experience, my dog has a serious pancreas issue and can only eat special treats prescribed by the vet. And while I appreciate your good intentions, you're not the one who's stuck paying the vet bill when you inadvertently ""poison"" my best friend.

All I ask is that you take 5 seconds to ask the owner if it's OK first."

We kept an eye on it and decided to take him to the vet today to make sure it wasn't anything serious.

This was the first time we've taken him to the vet, so we were slightly worried how he would react. He has been before but since we're his third owners, we hadn't had the pleasure yet.

He was SUCH a good boy at the vet! The vet praised him for being so inquisitive and curious and loving of new people. Usually the breed can be quite shy and reserved with new people.

He squirmed a little when the vet had to put fluorescent dye in his eyes to check his corneas but nothing too serious.

It was about time he got his yearly vaccines and check up so we decided to do this and save on having to get a new time next month.

He didn't even flinch when he got his shot and besides a bit of tartar (I think thats what it's called, we call it toothstones) a little too much weight and a small eye infection, he seems perfectly healthy.

He has been awarded with lots of pets and snuggles when we got home.

I did daycare and kennels for a while, and it was really fun, but it certainly didn't pay well.

371,[Help] Aggressive Boxer!,dogs,t3_aa7p8s,5,False,False,aa7p8s,"Soooo, I have a four year old male Boxer that I adopted when he was 8 weeks old. I‚Äôve raised him from a baby &amp; he is my baby! 

Basically his entire life he‚Äôs been pampered &amp; spoiled &amp; has remained true to the breed - adorably dumb &amp; forever in puppy mode. Boxers are my breed! They‚Äôre the best &amp; I‚Äôve had them my entire life.

He is a playful &amp; snuggly dog around all kids, loves everyone (terrible guard dog) &amp; is super intimidated by our cats. Basically a big ol‚Äô puppy. 

Then he sees another dog &amp; Cujo appears. 

His aggression towards other dogs is extremely violent, it almost seems like he *wants* to *fight*. There is no separating him when he gets into that mode, he basically loses his mind &amp; turns into a legitimate beast. It‚Äôs honestly terrifying. 

This behavior didn‚Äôt start until this year. He‚Äôs four years old &amp; we‚Äôve had other dogs in &amp; out of our home all of his life (we‚Äôve housed many dogs for friends throughout the years). But now a really horrifying trait has emerged &amp; he‚Äôs become difficult to handle.

We recently got new neighbors &amp; we‚Äôve had to carefully coordinate with them regarding dog outdoor schedules because they have a Boston Terrier that our dog keeps trying to attack through the fence.

We can no longer walk him because every time he encounters another dog he loses his fucking mind &amp; immediately starts foaming at the mouth &amp; wants to attack from a mile away &amp; he‚Äôs 90 lbs of pure muscle so he‚Äôs difficult to handle on a leash/harness when he enters that frame of mind.

Just last month, there was a stray dog who wandered up to our fence line &amp; my Boxer just happened to be in our backyard &amp; a terrible fight ensued &amp; our dog pretty much attempted to rip off the face of the stray dog through our chain link fence. It was a blood bath. I called animal control. 

Every time someone is walking their dog, I have to make sure he‚Äôs inside &amp; if he‚Äôs already inside, I have to make sure our big door is shut so he‚Äôs not even able to look out of the storm door because he‚Äôll charge the glass just to *try* to get to them.

I am at a loss. 

Over the summer I reached out to a trainer that was recommended to me by multiple people because he works with aggressive dogs &amp; yet he more or less kind of told me that he wasn‚Äôt going to help with my dog because some dogs just have that bred into them &amp; on one hand I believe that but on another I call bullshit. 

I love him, I‚Äôve raised him. I don‚Äôt know what I did or didn‚Äôt do that has made this behavior come out but he‚Äôs pretty much become a major stress in our lives because he‚Äôs a ticking time bomb &amp; a liability &amp; he‚Äôs going to kill someone‚Äôs dog &amp; that‚Äôs going to be devastating for EVERYONE because then he‚Äôll be the next to go.

374,[Fluff] [Monthly Brag] My dog healed.,dogs,t3_aa4nn7,6,False,False,aa4nn7,"This year- my little trio was on a road trip to go apartment hunting half-way across the country. 

On our very last stretch of the trip while visiting family and staying the night- I woke up to a dog I did not recognize. In a city I has spent zero time in. Over night- a crazy infection attacked her face- that in a matter of hours spread all the way from her nose to completely around her muzzle. And after a day without a cone- to her eye. 

I ran around like a crazy woman- spending the last of my funds on emergency visits and veterinary offices- only to find out absolutely nothing. Skin conditions can be tricky like that. I learned a very important thing I can hopefully transfer to y‚Äôall- no matter how scary it is- do not waste your time on an emergency vet for SKIN CONDITIONS. Go straight to booking a biopsy somewhere. You‚Äôll save precious time and money! And! STORE YOUR CONES SOMEWHERE. Don‚Äôt throw em out- cause sadly enough- you never know when you‚Äôll need them. 

Luckily enough we were able to rent a room from friends long enough to get this figured out. Luckily enough- we ended up at the very first vet school that took low-income patients... Turns out my dog ran into a fungus she was not accustomed to along the way- and had a really bad reaction. 

For two months- she was coned. She was quarantined. For two months- she lost her ability to play and sniff and eat normal food. She was depressed and she was angry at the world for not being able to do the bare necessities. 

People told me to give up. We persevered- and she most definitely did not give up. They say that these skin conditions can leave a permanent scar, take up to a year to heal. That she might not have grown her hair back. Well y‚Äôall- this picture is from [today](https://imgur.com/m11Bqml).She‚Äôs back to chasing squirrels up trees. She‚Äôs growing all that hair back. She‚Äôs happy!

375,[Help] Does my 12.5 yr old golden retriever have dementia?,dogs,t3_aa44nh,4,False,False,aa44nh,"Sorry for the essay - My boy Bobby is in superb physical health despite his age but he has been behaving oddly for the past 5-6 months. He has always been very well behaved, has never tried to escape, doesn‚Äôt come up the stairs (he‚Äôs not allowed) - but in the last 5-6 months he:
(1) constantly tries to escape so now we have to tie him to a long rope when he wants to go outside and this only happens in the late afternoon and evenings. He always barks (sort of whiney barks) when he is outside for no apparent reason other than only being able to go 5 meters from the door, and he refuses to come back inside even though he might‚Äôve been out there for several hours in the freezing cold, even really tasty treats and food can‚Äôt lure him back. When he does manage to escape, we often find him looking confused in the neighbours driveway.
(2) he sneaks upstairs and scratches the carpet in the corners of bedrooms, mostly at door corners such as a wardrobe door or en-suite door - and again, he refuses to move even when offered treats. He always looks sad and worried when I find him and comforting him doesn‚Äôt make him any better
(3) he seems to get worried and scared when there are more than 3-4 people around, when usually he has always been very sociable.

He‚Äôs a golden and absolutely loves food, so it‚Äôs so strange that now even the tastiest and smelliest of treats cannot make him move and he refuses them. He still happily eats his breakfast and dinner every day without any issue. We have noticed he does better in the mornings - he is his sociable self, seems happy, looks forward to his daily walk, doesn‚Äôt try to escape. He also sleeps all throughout the night with no issues.
He doesn‚Äôt have any issues with urinating inside which is usually the case when dogs have dementia, right? 
Our main concern is when he tries to escape and he‚Äôs obviously not happy being tied up, I know he enjoys doing his rounds of the garden which is fairly large. We have thoroughly checked for escape routes but he always finds a way. 
He probably does have dementia... if you guys agree, is there anything we can do to make him happier?

Thanks for your help. Sorry for the long post.

379,[Help] Adopting a 4yo lab/husky mix into a house with a cat- looking for advice,dogs,t3_aa6fp9,8,False,False,aa6fp9,"Hello!

Like the title says, my fianc√© and I are adopting a 4-year-old dog that is supposedly a lab/husky mix (she doesn‚Äôt seem to have much husky in her from her looks, I intend to do DNA testing). She‚Äôs being given up because her family recently had a baby with severe respiratory issues and the baby cannot be in a house with animals.

I grew up with a collie, golden retriever, and newfie mix. I was pretty involved in training them, and have helped friends with their dogs. Fianc√© and I are animals lovers who have been waiting to own our own house to adopt a dog of our own- the timing seems perfect to give this girl a new,
forever home. We currently have a 8ish year old cat, who has been around dogs when friends with dogs have stayed over, and through one roommate who had a dog. She‚Äôs mostly aloof with any other animal, but tolerates their presence eventually.

The dog is fixed, up to date on all her shots, and seems well-socialized and pretty well trained. She‚Äôs never been kept in a crate. She has been around children, small dogs, and some guinea pigs, all without issue. Her current owner says she has chased squirrels and stray cats, but has never chased any indoor animals. However, she hasn‚Äôt ever been around an indoor cat and due to the distance between us and her, we can‚Äôt do an introduction prior to adopting her. 

So far, I‚Äôve installed a very tall pet gate (with a small cat door) in an area where the dog can be confined while we are at work. I intend to introduce the animals slowly and to keep them separated unless we are around to monitor. Eventually, if they seem to be okay, I plan to leave the cat door on the gate open so that the cat can roam freely, but have an escape route if need be. 

I‚Äôve read a lot about introducing cats and dogs, but most of that advice includes crate training which I‚Äôm hesitant to do to a dog that‚Äôs never been in a crate, especially while she‚Äôs going through so many other changes. None of my dogs growing up were ever in crates, and that may also play into my hesitation. 

Does anyone have additional advice for introducing the two animals/ensuring safety for our very loved cat? Will it be less effective without a crate? Will her (possibly) being part husky make this more dangerous?

I want to do what‚Äôs best for both animals and all advice is very wanted. "

386,"[Breeds] DNA test results in for my ""2 year old lab mix""",dogs,t3_aa1q0c,12,False,False,aa1q0c,"I adopted Waffle about 6 weeks ago and instantly wanted to be sure of his breed background so I could have some more guidance on how to approach training. I thought he was around two years old but learned quickly he is MUCH younger-- right around one year old probably, so still has a lot of puppy behavior.

I have been frustrated that he seems somewhat disinterested in treats and learning new commands. I haven't dealt with a dog before that just doesn't seem to connect the ask with the reward. He knows sit very well but even after 6 weeks needs a gentle reminder that I'm asking him to do something. I've been saying ""potty"" and trying to give treats every time he goes to the bathroom outside and yet still he does it on his own time. [Well I think his surprising DNA results help explain some of that...](https://imgur.com/a/SgLWw4X)

My vet then drops a bombshell saying if my dog happens to go into cardiac arrest because of the anesthesia and his old age, it‚Äôs my decision to try and revive him (with complications after) or have him pass.   

How the hell I‚Äôm I going to make that decision? Also I won‚Äôt even have the chance to say good-bye. I‚Äôm literally sick to my stomach and feel so bad for my boy, he‚Äôs so innocent and doesn‚Äôt have a clue what‚Äôs wrong.

388,[Help] Advice on possibly rehoming a dog with behavioral issues (separation anxiety),dogs,t3_aa5o0t,5,False,False,aa5o0t,"It kills me to be making this post, but I really want some advice. I have a dog (Chihuahua mix) who has extreme separation anxiety. When I first adopted him 5 years ago, I didn‚Äôt work so all my time was for him and we were the best of friends. He was a sweet, chill, well behaved dog. Nowadays I have to work full time, and his behavioral problems due to anxiety just keep getting worse and worse. I have tried everything, from behavioral training, getting him a crate, supplements, spending more time with him, extra exercise, but none of it is even remotely helping. He gets into everything when I‚Äôm not paying attention to him and it makes him sick.

I think I‚Äôve come to the realization that he‚Äôs not as happy as he could be with me. I think he needs someone who is around more, and unfortunately being in my mid 20s, that can‚Äôt be me. As heartbreaking as it is, I made a commitment to ensure that this sweet dog has the best life he possibly can, and I think the next right thing to do may be to see if there‚Äôs someone who might be a better match for him.

Has anyone had any experience with rehoming dogs with difficult behavior issues? He‚Äôs not aggressive. I‚Äôm not trying to pin this issue onto someone else unexpectedly, so I want to be upfront. I know that he needs a specific kind of person with a lot of time for him. I guess I just don‚Äôt even know where to start. I‚Äôve never rehomed a pet before and the fact that I‚Äôm leaning toward this has made me cry so many times. Ultimately I want him to be happy, and I will not stop caring for him unless I absolutely know that I found someone who could make him happier than me.

I‚Äôm in the Pacific Northwest US if that helps."

I have two lovely dogs, but the youngest (a 1-year-old unneutered male) keeps peeing in the house. I use the bathroom as a kennel for my pups when I'm at work so they don't pee in the house. Whenever I am home and let them roam, he always has accidents despite that the bathroom has tons of pads.

1. Do any of you have tips to get him trained to use the pads I have in the bathroom?
2. Please leave suggestions for diapers that fit securely. Most diapers (both reusable and disposable) do not fit him as they slip off his tail easily or his private parts don't fit. Know of perhaps a diaper that fits around his chest?"

394,[breeds] Help me choose a dog please!,dogs,t3_aa1wke,5,False,False,aa1wke,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* This will be the first dog I own by myself. I grew up with dogs, though.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* I prefer to rescue a dog

 3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* I live in an apartment, so I need something that is fine with not having too much space. However, I go hiking a lot and I live in an area that has good parks, so I want something that will be able to keep up on a hike (or is at least easy to carry if it gets tired and I have to carry it).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* I would like something smaller since I live in an apartment. I've only ever had border collies, so I would be comfortable with something similar to that, but a border collie's energy level and need for stimulation will not fit my lifestyle at this time. I've also spent time around golden retrievers, but I worry that those would be too big for my current lifestyle.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* The most important thing is being good with people and other dogs and being a good walker. I would also like to teach the dog to do tricks, but that's not very important.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* Several hours a day. I am gone for work about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so I worry the dog would not get enough interaction, but besides that I will be able to interact with the dog almost all the time.  

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* I plan on walking the dog for at least an hour every day. I don't think there is a dog park in my area, but there are a lot of dogs around, so it will get plenty of interaction with other dogs and people.  

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I am open to brushing and basic grooming at home. If the dog needs an actual haircut beyond basic trimming, I will take it to a groomer, but I would prefer to keep this to a few times a year rather than a monthly trip to the groomer. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Something smaller that can live in an apartment. I believe most apartments in my area have a 50 lbs limit for dogs, so something smaller than that. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* I prefer a minimum on all three. A quieter dog would be ideal since I live in an apartment.  

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* I would like a dog that can learn to handle itself off-leash so I don't have to worry about what it may do, but I do not intend to let my dog off-leash in an unfenced area.  

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* I would like a snuggly dog.  

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?  \* I would like an eager-to-please dog.  

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I would like a dog that will alert me to someone entering our home, but doesn't go crazy with barking and jumping.  

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No. Because of the area I live in and living in an apartment, a dog-aggressive dog is not an option. There are other dogs in my building, so the dog will at some point encounter another dog in the elevator. It must be able to behave with other dogs and people in an elevator.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?  \* Chewing on things  

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* About 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* I am the only person in the household, so the dog will be my responsibility.  

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* I may at some point get a cat.  

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* No, but there are children in my neighborhood, so I would like to teach the dog how to interact with children.  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I currently rent. I believe the weight restriction is 50 lbs and under.  

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* I live in Wisconsin. I am not sure about laws banning specific breeds in my area, but I am not interested in controversial breeds, such as pitbulls, because I rent and they would limit my housing options.  

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* The temperature in Wisconsin fluctuates a lot. A summer day is usually around 80F, but can get into the 90s. A winter day is around 20F, but can get well below zero.  

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* I travel a lot throughout the state, so the dog will also be traveling a lot. I need something that will be good with car rides. A typical long car ride will be 1-4 hours a few times a month. There will be plenty of opportunities to stop and let the dog out, so it won't be 4 hours straight in the car.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  \* Is there a dog that is even right for my lifestyle? I worry about leaving it home for 8 hours while I'm at work. "
395,"[HELP] We brought in a stray, and want my current dog to be comfortable",dogs,t3_aa6x7z,2,False,False,aa6x7z,"On Christmas Eve we brought in the sweetest and most gentle black lab stray- we figured she had to have been somebody‚Äôs pet at some point because she is spayed, but her current health conditions are so severe it was obvious she had been separated for awhile or was poorly taken care of. 

Not to go into too much detail, but long story short when we took her into the vet they found a microchip. Apparently her previous owner has died and has nowhere to go but the pound. She is estimated to be 8 y/o with severe hematoma in both ears (so solid the vet couldn‚Äôt drain them), ear infections, and is extremely underweight. We figured that her chances of being adopted as a middle aged dog with health conditions that require attention were not fantastic, so we decided to keep her. 

What I‚Äôm worried about is our current dog. Our current dog is a 5 y/o female lab mix. They did not meet face to face until today, after Stray got the OK from the vet. Current dog is friendly but cautious around new dogs, but does have a couple of doggy friends who we have noticed she gets along great with. I have been hearing horror stories about keeping two females together in the same house. I was wondering if anybody had tips to make the transition easier? During their first meeting, new dog was very lick-y which I understand means she is showing some submissive behaviors. They did ok- they aren‚Äôt playful but they don‚Äôt seem to hate each other. There have been a few snaps, but I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs just some normal doggy communication that doesn‚Äôt need much worry. Current dog let her in the house fine after some outdoor introductions, and they are existing in the same space pretty decently. 

I don‚Äôt want tensions to build / develop to a point that we have to get rid of new dog, but we have to keep current dog happy as she is our first priority. Is this f/f pairing inherently a disaster? And is a not-perfect first impression mean they will never be friends? Are there tips for a smooth transition for both my new and old dog? "

400,[Help] My dog is not friendly to my husband,dogs,t3_aa2uys,6,False,False,aa2uys,"Hey all.

A bit of background: I've had my dog, a female shepherd/husky cross named Karma, for a little over three years now. She was about three when I got her and I was told she had been badly abused by a man in the past, so she would be a bit careful around men in general going forward. I'm female, so she bonded to me quite easily and we're the best of friends.

My husband recently moved in with me, as of September this year. When I'm around, she still clearly prefers my company, but will tolerate him or sometimes even indulge him in play. When I'm not around, or even if I'm just sleeping, she is very cold to him. She growls and shows her teeth when he approaches, hides upstairs from him, and won't even come down when asked if she wants to go for a walk (#1 favourite thing in the world) or offered food (#2 favourite thing in the world). He has even tried to put her collar and leash on while she's upstairs, so that she understands he really means he wants to take her for a walk, and she will just lay there and stare at him, refusing to budge. The only thing that ever works is pouring her dog food into her dish, which brings her running downstairs at top speed, at which point he can slip on her collar and leash and take her outside for a walk. On her walks with him, she is completely fine.

He has never hit her. He offers her food, treats, cuddles, pets, and play very often, but she never warms up to him unless I'm in the room. How can we get her to like him more? I know the abuse in the past is the key factor here, but it's been over three years since that's happened at least, and my dad also used to live in this house, so surely she understands by now that men are not all bad. She even approaches men she doesn't know who visit our home, or men we encounter on walks, albeit carefully.

Thanks for any suggestions!

402,[Discussion] / [Advice] Human gets between dog fight and comes out bitten - what would you do?,dogs,t3_aa6jzd,3,False,False,aa6jzd,"My first-time dog-walker (call him ""Steve"") took my dog (""Samson"" - 2 y/o large breed) to the enclosed dog park in my apartment complex. The only other people/dogs there was my neighbor (""Blake"") and his dog (""Bubba"" -3y/o large breed). I was not there. Neither animal has any history whatsoever with aggression or biting humans.

\-

Samson and Bubba have played before. They are both good dogs, but do growl when playing occasionally. This time, however, apparently their fighting got more serious than usual, Blake stepped in to separate them, and came out with a bite on his hand which he says came from Samson. He had to go to ER, see a hand specialist, but thankfully has no long-term damage and now no further treatment is needed.

\-

Blake and I have been extremely cordial and communicative throughout the whole process. I was out of state when this occurred, so I've had to listen to the only two accounts present - Steve and Blake. I'd like to keep Steve's account out of the equation here, as it makes things more complicated as he does not sound reliable (as in, when I asked him what happened he made no mention of any injury or bite whatsoever, when it was apparently so clear that Blake was in pain that 2 other neighbors came out of their apartments to see what was going on). That being said, for the sake of argument, let's say Blake's account is factual. Blake says (in his own words) that he should have pulled Bubba by the hind legs, but instead, grabbed him by the chest/torso - which happened to be where Samson's next bite was landing. I want to make clear, that this is his account and that I'm not trying to put a positive spin on this for my sake. We've both apologized, agreed this is an unfortunate circumstance, and Blake has said countless times he knows Samson was not going for his hand, that the force dogs use against each other is far different than what they use with humans, etc.

\-

Neither of us want to involve legal counsel and would like to handle privately. I've let him know that I'm happy to help with medical costs, but did not give specifics or an amount. He was grateful for that, the same way I was for him (at this point at least) saying he did not wish to hire a lawyer or take this to court. He is a genuinely good person and I'd like to think we are both rational, not-reactionary people. Our most recent meeting was important as it finally totaled the bills. After insurance, the conclusive cost was $900.

\-

I asked him what he believed was fair. He asked for me to pay the full amount. I said I'd like to think about it. I wanted to ask this community, from an ethical and/or legal perspective, what would you offer?

\-

PS - just in case some people ask, but not sure this factors into your answers, both of us are tight on money. I am in debt (but with a steady job) and he is a full-time grad student.

PSS - I have already let Blake know (in person) that I wasn't planning on paying the full amount (but I do want to pay some portion of it) - and asked if refusing to pay ""all"" of it was problematic for him. He said no, that it was just a starting offer. Why not ask for it all at first. I told him I'd do the same thing if I were in his position."

406,[HELP] Dog suddenly behaving strange around 10 month old baby... unsure what to think.,dogs,t3_aa1m80,5,False,False,aa1m80,"Our 7 year old terrier mix has always been super sweet with our new addition - kept his distance most of the time but would come by with the occasional lick and tail wag, and would lay in her room as I put her down for a nap. Baby's now nearly 10 months and crawling and walking with a push toy like crazy, and suddenly I have a weird feeling about his behavior towards her. He follows her around when she's walking and gets up in her face to lick her and if I call him to sit on the couch and leave her alone he watches her like a hawk. I can't tell if it's just cute protectiveness or if I should be worried that her new mobility is causing him to, I dunno, feel more dominant? He's also been more clingy with me, following me around the house and sitting next to me all the time. Perhaps the two are related... some sort of newfound jealousy?

I suppose I should be 100% transparent and admit he's had aggression issues before with other dogs and strangers (mostly mailmen). We've been extra super cautious with the two of them because of his history, and as of just a couple days ago he's never displayed any sort of worrisome behaviors towards the baby ( I wonder if I'm being paranoid because of past issues?)

Are there any behaviors in particular I should keep an eye out for? I NEVER allow them to be alone together of course, but everything I search about ""issues with dogs licking baby's face"" seems to be about germs whereas I'm more concerned about him becoming aggressive towards her.

Any insight is appreciated."
407,[Help] Older rescue seems miserably bored but won't play,dogs,t3_aa0x3m,8,False,False,aa0x3m,"Hello all! Haven't posted on reddit in years so hoping this is all within this subs rules...

&amp;#x200B;

I have a +/- 10 year old rescue brussels griffon, who my husband rescued before we met and it was estimated he was around 5 at that time. We have speculated that he was very likely a stud, as his features are purebred, he was not fixed (at \~5yo) when he was found, he has a clearly abusive history/PTSD, and he didn't know how to use stairs, a harness, or act like a ""dog"" (barely still does).

&amp;#x200B;

He's come A LONG LONG way and we're so proud of him, but now that he's happier and healthier, he's much spunkier and seems to be needing something that we cannot figure out  / don't know how to give him.

&amp;#x200B;

An attempt at a long-story-short: he never learned how to play and won't play, but is bored to death all of the time it seems like. He doesn't care about toys (but also doesn't have enough teeth to use them anyway) and is not really smart enough (sorry little guy) to fetch or anything of the like. He's food-motivated but only for meals (kongs w/ peanut butter, etc, have failed and his face is too flat for food mazes, he'd just starve.... ), and leaving him with food-motivated toys only results in him pooping or peeing on them (he's only housebroken when you're home... joys of a rescue). We don't have a yard right now and are not allowed to get another dog in our place... we've been looking to move FOR his sake specifically, but it's been unrealistic so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly, the only way we've ever been able to figure out he likes to ""play"" is for him to stand vaguely out of reach from you and bark. That's it. He doesn't/won't stray from us at off-leash parks and he doesn't care at all about other dogs. He's not smart enough (or simply not interested enough) in doing anything like nose-training (and tbh I'm not sure his senses are good enough for anything like that either). Sadly we can't afford doggie daycare and don't have any friends with dogs to go on dates with, and no friends who can stop by to get some energy out who are available or nearby....

&amp;#x200B;

He's often sighing heavily and constantly fidgeting (not in pain, had that checked out....) and is very dramatic during the night standing up and collapsing down onto the hardwoods when people are trying so sleep, clearly indicating he is antsy. All I can think of is to just walk/run him harder but he's fickle about that (particularly in inclement weather, in seattle), and that's not very ""fun"" either really.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just wondering/hoping anyone might have any behavioral insight or suggestions who know more about this than we do? Poor guy seems miserable and giving scritches/pets/love is just not cutting it. Thank you so much!!

408,[Vent] People need to stop putting their hands on random strangers' dogs in public places without asking. ESPECIALLY when I'm actively training the dog.,dogs,t3_a9vthd,20,False,False,a9vthd,"Some people disagree with me, but I'm of the opinion that dogs don't really like being pet on the head.  I know that about 2/3 of the dogs I've had in my life (over a dozen) would much prefer a chest pat.

Then we amp that up by introducing the people who don't ask permission to pet a stranger's dog and just assume that because the dog looked their way and isn't growling that touching it is okay.  And then they always go for the head.

Then we amp that up because a lot of these people have children.  Some of these children get to the dogs before the parents do and immediately man-handle them whilst squealing and screaming.  This could be *extremely* dangerous and result in a dog being put down for being ""dangerous"" or ""aggressive"" when he was actually unexpectedly tackled from behind by two rambunctious children.

Then...  We amp *that* up by throwing my training into the mix.  I cannot tell you how many times a week my training sessions get fucked up by random folks or their kids coming up behind me then touching the dog as I'm working with it.  I really can't stand it when they *call the dog to jump up on them.*  I can catch them if they're coming from the sides or in front of me, but when I'm working the dogs and their owners and they come up from behind, I usually don't see them until there's a hand near the dog's face.

It pisses these folks off when I tell them not to touch the dog because it's in training.  I really want to ask them how they'd feel if someone just ran up behind their child and picked her/him up and gave it a kiss on the cheek?  And that's still not incorporating the risk of freaking out a skittish dog and causing it to snarl or bite.  People usually don't bite, even when they're freaked out...

I can't believe this isn't common courtesy knowledge.  Maybe it's because I grew up around dogs and have worked with them for seven years...  But it's still unbelievable to me."

415,[Help] Neverending allergies and concurrent infections; our pup is suffering.,dogs,t3_aa1of8,21,False,False,aa1of8,"\[Help\]  My husband and I rescued my dog, an AmStaff, 1.5 years ago and he's currently 3.5 years old.  He had red paws and itchiness when we first got him, which was diagnosed as allergies by our first, local vet.  This began our neverending battle with allergic reactions and skin infections. (He turns tomato red, licks constantly, has broken skin w/ pustules at times, and often carries concurrent infections. Sometimes I wonder if the skin infection is truly a by-product of the allergic reactions or if he has an ongoing infection separately and in addition to his allergies.) The thing is, his issues have gotten exponentially worse with time.  Last winter he was fairly decent, but this winter he is miserable without some combination of ketoconazole (antifungal), apoquel, and cephalexin (antibiotic) and, sometimes, even when medicated he is still bright red and absolutely miserable.  The vets claim it's because he's allergic to non-seasonal triggers (mold, food) but that doesn't seem plausible to me, because then he would have reacted similarly last year, no? We've seen 4 vets and they all give the same advice (more drugs, more drugs, more drugs) but I've had my own experiences with constant antibiotic/medication use and know first-hand the repercussions.  I cringe every time I give him his medicine at this point and am emotionally exhausted from seeing him suffer and feeling powerless to help. We've had him allergy-tested and he's allergic to so much that I feel like he might have immune confusion, histamine intolerance and/or mast cell activation disorder; vets don't seem to want to entertain that possibility though. Here's a list of what we've tried and/or are currently trying:

* Specialized diet (removed offending foods; fed only freeze-dried and frozen raw)
* Allergy-testing (allergic to many proteins and peas, along with grasses, trees, weeds, and some molds)
* Low-dose immunotherapy shots and sublinguals (started with shots - total nightmare, so switched to sublinguals; over-reacted to the triggers so took him off it)
* Apoquel  (as needed; makes him lethargic and cuts allergic response in half)
* Antibiotics (specifically cephalexin, aka keflex; so many rounds I can't count)
* Ketoconazole (antifungal; daily - absolutely terrible for his liver)
* Medicated shampoos (once weekly; seems to temporarily kill bacteria and yeast but also irritates his already damaged skin)
* Non-histamine producing probiotics (daily)
* S. Boulardii probiotic when not taking Ketoconazole to see if that would reduce yeast issues (didn't notice a difference)
* Digestive enzymes (daily)
* Immune support supplement ([Thorne's Immugen](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/immugen-reg) for dogs)
* Kidney glandular supplements (for DAO supplementation to reduce histamine; no noticeable improvement)
* [Histoplex supplement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073G7N2G5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) by Biotics Research (no noticeable difference)
* Betadine spray and liquid betadine for his skin (seems to help but it stings and he hates it)
* Quercetin w/ Bromelain (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Benadryl and Quercetin (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Pollock Oil (anti-inflammatory; improvement in coat and skin but not irritation/reaction)
* CBD oil for inflammation and discomfort (just started)
* Redonyl Ultra (just started; contains PEA and omegas; hoping it stabilizes mast cells and helps his skin)

I'm sure I'm missing something but this is where we're at.  Any help at all would be much appreciated.  We're so desperate at this point. :-(   Thanks, everyone.

417,[Breeds] What breeds would be right for me?,dogs,t3_aa1kjj,6,False,False,aa1kjj,"Hi r/dogs! I am currently a grad student and could not take care of a doggo right now. Being a (good) dog owner is definitely a goal in my life so I wanted to be a bit proactive now, and look into what companion would be best for me in 2-3 years..

**Introduction**

 * *Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?* 

Yes! I have no experience.

* *Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?*

 I would prefer going through a reputable breeder, especially since I might be interested in showing my dog.

* *Describe your ideal dog.* 

I would like my dog to be my companion. They would be fairly easily trained and more on the quiet side. I'd like them to be playful without being overly excited.

* *What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?* 

I live in a small apartment so toy breeds are definitely what I am looking into. Most of my family is in Europe and I like that I could bring my dog with me in the cabin when flying (I think the max. weight is 16lbs?). I was interested in long-coated Chihuahuas especially. I loved the look of toy Eskies but I hear they love to bark, which my neighbours would never forgive me for, same for Pomeranians. I also liked Italian Greyhounds. In any case I am open to suggestions!

* *What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?* 

Definitely basic obedience. Like I mentioned, if they can, I think it might be fun to go to dog shows - I really like the idea of my dog and I having our own special activity. Later on I might be interested in fostering seeing-eye dogs in training, so a dog that can get along with other dogs would be ideal.

**Care Commitments**

*  *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*  

I don't have an clear idea of what my dog would need in terms of training, but I thought I would be interacting with him pretty much constantly when at home.


*  *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?* 

I would like a total of 90 minutes/day split into maybe 2-3 walks, or smaller walks + going to the dog park. I also want my dog to either go to daycare during workdays, or at least be visited my a walker once a day.

*  *How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?* 

I am open to it completely, I hope my dog can be too! I would rather avoid going to a professional and save money that way.

**Personal Preferences**

  *  *What size dog are you looking for?* 

A mini one! Definitely toy or a small breed.

*  *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?* 

Medium shedding, although these are things can be dealt with. I am much less open to barking, so minimal barking.

* *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?* 

Not very. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

  *  *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?* 

Very much a snuggly one, otherwise I'd get a cat XD. I do worry about separation anxiety though..

  *  *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?* 

 Since I am a beginner, I think an eager-to-please dog would be easier for me, although there are limits - didn't someone post about their dog pooing to please them?? XD Yeah, I'd rather not, thanks dog.

  *  *How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?* 

By coming to me first I guess? With some curiosity but not bother visitors.

 * *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?* 

No. I don't know what I could do if my dog were aggressive in daycare for example..

  *  *Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?* 

Barking is the big one, I guess things like puppy biting and walking on a leash can be taught or addressed so I can't think of anything else.

**Lifestyle**

  * *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?* 

I am very much looking for remote positions but I will most probably work 9-5 so doggo would be left alone 4 hours before being walked, and 4 hours before I come home. I am looking into daycares.

  *  *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?* I will be the sole caretaker of the dog.

  *  *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?* 

I want to foster seeing-eye puppies in the future, or at least get other dogs.

 *  *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?* No.

  *  *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?* 

Yes, I rent. There are no specific restrictions but the dog should be well-behaved. I think having an obedience certificate might be an asset but that is just my opinion. In the future, if the gods smile upon me and I am able to ever afford a house, you bet I'd like big dogs.

  *  *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?* 

I am currently in Montreal, Canada, but I may move upon graduation. The city currently taxes pitbull owners.

  *  *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?* 

Summer: 25-28 Celsius or 77-82 Fahrenheit although climate change is hitting us hard and we had weeks at 35-42¬∞C or 95-107¬∞F. Winter: 0¬∞C to - 20¬∞C or 32¬∞F to -4¬∞F

**Additional Information and Questions**

  *  *Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.* I don't have a car, and don't plan on getting one. 

   * * Feel free to ask any questions below.*
I would like to know how much daycare is costing you guys, or if you have tips on finding reputable breeders and dog walkers.. I am curious to hear all your experiences and feedback! Thanks for reading all of this!

419,[Discussion] Big dog being slightly aggressive towards small dog,dogs,t3_aa4rr4,1,False,False,aa4rr4,"So, we just got a new dog last week. I believe the breed is Lhasa Apso. He was abandoned and we adopted him from the shelter. He's about one year old they said. He's a good little guy. He has a calm demeaner, and it seems like he had started training. He follows behind you when you're walking, knows to stay and sit, and he loves playing with his toys. He has no behavioral issues from what I can tell.

Our old dog died about 6 months ago and she was about 15 and never really played with our old dog much for the last year of her life.

Our other dog is an 8 year old husky heeler mix. He's super high energy, my mom has trained him to demand attention. She has coddled him the past six months since her other dog died. So he follows her everywhere, gets up in your face if you aren't petting him, expects to be fed at the dinner table. All fine, but I think it contributes to his issues with the new dog.

We made sure both dogs were okay with each other before we adopted him and the adoption lady said everything seemed fine and we took him home.

Well it's been a little over a week now and our old dog is really aggressive with the new dog. When the new dog has a toy, the old dog comes over rips it away from him and takes it back to his bed and leaves it there. If the small dog tries to grab it, the old dog growls or snaps at him. When they're both outside, if I throw a toy and the small dog reaches it first, the big dog kinda shoves him and rips it away. If the small dog is getting pet, the big dog stares at the small dog and starts growling. If the small dog tries to sleep in the room with the big dog(my parents room) the big dog growls or takes up more room so the small dog can't stay.

As a result, the poor guy sleeps on the couch all day and doesn't get to go to his bed. He won't go in the room where my parents sleep unless he's walking with someone else. He doesn't get to play with any toys and he always looks so sad. I try to give him the attention he is lacking, cause he is just a pup still, he deserves someone spending time with him. But I can't do that all day. My mom, who stays home all day, says they just need time and it's perfectly normal. But I can't help feel that if the old dog is not disciplined for his behavior, he'll normalize this and not change.

So I'm just curious on what we can do better? What can I do to make the small dog happy? Do they need time? Am I doing something wrong? Does the old dog need discipline? I just don't want this new dog feeling left out. We brought him home with the promise to love him and I don't think he feels at home. Sorry if this seems stupid, I just want to correct this early so it doesn't remain a problem."

I'm not sure what to do now, I've been told that neutering him will curb some of this aggression but are there any other steps that I can take in order to calm him completely? Is this aggression because he is starting to mature?"
425,[Help] My dogs dick is always out. What can I do?,dogs,t3_aa1pfd,2,False,False,aa1pfd,"Hey guys! So, I have a 4 year old Shih Tuz Yorkie named Beans, I love him and he‚Äôs great even though he has his moments. For some reason his dick is always out. Sometimes it‚Äôs just the tip other times it‚Äôs a good inch. Whenever people meet him I can tell it makes them uncomfortable. Even I think it‚Äôs gross and awkward when it‚Äôs just out, I‚Äôll say ‚ÄúBeans, put your dick away you perv‚Äù, I get no response.  He‚Äôs a really cute dog so I get a lot of people who want to meet him and cuddle with him. I‚Äôve taken him to the vet twice, payed 40$ for the vet to just flip his skin back over his dick.  Which was pointless because when we got home it was out again! I cut the hairs around his dick Incase they were getting in the way of him pulling it back in. That maybe him licking himself was to try and lubreacte it or something. I tell him to stop every time I see him licking himself and then don‚Äôt make eye contact. Sometimes, like if it‚Äôs really cold or for some unknown reason, he puts it away but only for a few hours. I don‚Äôt remember if he‚Äôs always been like this, he‚Äôs my first dog so maybe I just thought it was normal at first. I don‚Äôt know what else I can do since the vet hasn‚Äôt really been helpful. 

Has anyone else had the same experience or knows what to do??  I‚Äôd really appreciate any help or advice, even just support! "
426,"[Help] Dog's whimpers, anxiety, and noise driving me nuts - at my wits end!",dogs,t3_aa3sud,2,False,False,aa3sud,"Throwaway because this is really complainy and probably makes me sound like a not so nice person.  I have a 13 year old Chow Mix, she is about 60 lbs.  We've had her for about 2 years, and adopted her from the shelter.  While she came well trained in some very positive ways, I am having some serious problems with annoying behavior and I am not sure what to do.  Its so bad that Christmas Eve when she managed to break out of the back yard and went missing, I had mixed feelings about her returning.  If she had happily moved in with another family, I think I might have been okay with that.

The first day I got her and my husband left the house, and I was home alone with her, she ran up to me and HUMPED me.  I shook her off and she did it again.  I am a small female and felt ridiculously uncomfortable.  I know it is my fault on a mental level that it creeped me out so much, but I cannot help it.  I know she is a dog and not a creepy person, but subconsciously I found the incident disturbing.  I think this caused me having trouble bonding with her.  I didnt really want to pet her very much.  The other thing that hurt our bond is she was constantly chasing my cats and tormenting them.  This behavior is better, but I love my cats to death and I was very upset that they no longer wanted to come out and cuddle but hide from her.  Most of my cats are back to normal now, took about 6 months, but I have one that has become so reclusive we had to give her her own room.  Whenever I go into this cat's room, the dog will sit outside and whimper loudly, which scares my cat who needs my love and care.  Right now she is so scared she refuses to come out of the closet and I need total quiet to get her to come out so I can pet her and bring her to her water and food bowl.  Yes, this is my cats fault, the dog has not actually chased her in a long time, and the cat has also become afraid of the other cats too.  The cat needs help.  I am aware.  However, that doesn't change the fact that I want my dog to go away from outside the cat's room door when I am attending to the cat.

As I type this I am in my bedroom and she is in the dining room outside my bedroom and she is whimpering.  She whimpers constantly.  It is high pitched, whiny, loud, and obnoxious.  Sometimes the reasons why are obvious, like there's a thunderstorm, and that is fine.  I always let her come in my room then and it usually helps.  However, most of the times the reasons I believe are due to anxiety, but I often can't pinpoint what.  For example, today I was in the kitchen making a bowl of yogurt, and she just starts whining.  No reason at all.  Just. Whining.

She also hyperventilates about 90% of the time and this will often turn in to whimpers and whines when she gets too worked up.  She'll start by panting/ loudly breathing really fast and intensely.  She will do this for hours and hours.  I have been around dogs my whole life, and it is much quicker than normal.  I have even had visitors comment on it, so I know its not just me, but the vet says it is fine.  I also was around a bunch of dogs over Christmas, and it stunned me at how CALM they were in comparison to her, even with all the people around.  So anyway, when her breathing really speeds up, she will kind of turn the breaths into whimpers and then start whimpering for a while.  She can control it too.  When I tell her to hush and look at her, she stops until I look away and then starts again.  The only time she doesnt do this is when she is asleep, which isn't very often.

I have really bad anxiety, and trouble with tachycardia, and this causes my anxiety and tachycardia to go through the roof.  When shes breathing quickly and anxiously it causes my heart rate to skyrocket and I need to either get away from her or take some propanolol which my doctor prescribed to lower my heart rate.  I try to mentally turn it off and ignore it but I cannot.  It is so loud and all encompassing.  She also will often follow on my heels whatever part of the house I am at- her nose a few inches from my butt - on high alert and follow (while panting of course).  That is OBNOXIOUS.  If she is not doing that she is usually staring at me with her ears up, trying to get my attention while doing her hyper pants and will not let me relax.  I just want to be able to read my Kindle or tend to my indoor plants or do something in peace.  As a result of this behavior I have stopped spending time in my living room and just go in my bedroom where I can keep her away.  in the 10% of the time she is calm and relaxed, I always make a point to praise her, and tell her she is a good girl, but it doesnt seem to be helping much.  As a result, my relationship with my cats suffers more.  Also I enjoy(ed) using other parts of the house.

At night she will sometimes go sleep at her doggy pillow (preferred, and this is far away from our bedroom), but when she gets bored she will get up and whimper outside our door.  She also has these loud jarring yelps that she will do when she wants to go outside.  I absolutely do not allow her to go outside until we wake up.  She always gets a chance to go to the bathroom before we got o bed.  Unfortunately my husband will sometimes go and let her out at 5AM.  I am not okay with this and have asked him not to, because it shows her that these yelps will get her what she wants.  She has the tendency to do this right when I am falling in to REM.  They are not like normal person walking by the house barks- which don't annoy me.  These are insidious in that they have the ability to rouse me from a deep sleep and completely recondition my brain so that I cannot go back to sleep for about 90 minutes.  They are extremely loud too.  It is like flipping a switch in my brain, and she knows it.  It is effective, it gets us up and gets my husband to let her outside.  As a result, I have been sleeping with these over the ear head phones, like the ones that you would use at a gun range...  they help in that I dont hear her nearly as often.  Ear plugs are not enough.  The headphones drown out almost all whimpers and about 75% of the yelps.  However this is not sustainable.  For one, they hurt my ear and neck, and are ripping at my hair.  More importantly, I am due in 2 months to have a baby and I will need to be able to hear him when he wakes.  I know I will be very sleep deprived soon because of the baby, and I don't need the dog contributing to this!  I also do not want these yelps and whimpers waking the baby.  In addition, like the cats room, whenever I go into the nursery I am preparing she starts loudly whining and whimpering.   This is absolutely unacceptable.  I can't have her doing this whenever I bring him to his changing table to change his diaper, or go to put in him or check on him in his crib, or any other reason I am in there.  

She will also do these bark/ yelps I mentioned for outside when she wants back inside, in the day or whenever.  I would prefer that she wait quietly by the door - we can see her.  I only let her inside when she has not barked for a few minutes, and this does seem to be helping somewhat.  Again my husband often will let her back inside when she yelps, which only enforces the behavior.

She has a clean bill of health for her age - only some minor pain in her back that the vet doesnt think should be bothering her too much.  All of the rest of her is in working order and the vet is not concerned about the excessive hyper panting, even though I can't imagine it is healthy and have never seen it before in another dog.  She is intelligent and picks up new tricks quickly, and was also well trained before we adopted her - she rarely goes to the bathroom in the house (and if she does its usually because we forgot to walk her or we were out all day, so its not her fault) doesn't sit on or paw on furniture, chew up the house, etc.  If it weren't for the excessive noise and hyper activity, she would be a great dog, but I just cannot relax around her and I am at my wits end.  If I cannot fix these behaviors and they cause more problems with the baby I don't know what I am going to do.  It would kill my husband if I were to rehome her - she's his first dog and even though the problems bother him he is attached to her.  I've never even thought about wanting to rehome a pet before, and I have never had a dog or cat I couldn't bond with, besides her.  Its also not like the dog doesn't know that these behaviors are problems - like I said she is smart.  Any advice on how to train her to calm down and be quiet?"

428,[Help] Senior Dog Increasingly Aggressive,dogs,t3_aa3nki,4,False,False,aa3nki," 

So our 13 year old 32 lb corgi-Sheppard mix has been with me since 2007. Since I adopted him, he's been a great dog with energy and playfulness...etc...until recently. Almost 2 years ago my wife and I had a daughter, who has now taken attention off the dog. As a result, our dog has been unruly and jealous when it comes to our daughter. He has always been food aggressive and protective of his bow, but now that food aggressiveness has extended into aggressively stealing food from our daughter, and attempting to jump up and get food off of her highchair. He seems to think there's always food being given out and he has to steal it. I can have nothing in my hand and I'll pass by him and he will jump out and nibble at my had as if I had some food for him. He has a full bowl of his own food and water available to him at all times, but I'm not sure if he's just forgetting where it is? It's empty in the morning so he does find it and eat it. He does display some symptoms of dementia as he will randomly whine and seem to get ""lost"" in the house. I've recently ordered him some multivitamins and some CBD oil via Amazon and am hoping that helps calm him down. He seems in pain in his hips as he doesn't like to be picked up or moved anymore. In fact, if you pick him up he will snarl and bark viciously at you, and depending on who you are he will bite at you to let you know he doesn't want to be picked up. The other odd behaviors when it comes to our daughter is he will go to her door at night and sniff at the bottom of it, and try to get it open so he can get in. He used to get her door open at our old house where our handles were horizontal and not round. I'm not sure how to discourage this behavior (or if I should just open the door?). In the past he just would lay by the crib, but this behavior wakes my daughter up during her nap during the day. As far as how he normally interacts with her, he's fine, and my daughter is learning to gently pet him. Sometimes he gets in her space though and when she goes to ""push"" him away, he does that snarling/barking aggressiveness toward her without biting (at which point I have to tell my daughter to be gentle with him, but at the same time, she doesn't want him stealing her food o\_O). During the day he sleeps upstairs in his doggy bed in the master bedroom, but at night, he likes to not be in the same room as us, and sleep on the couch in the living room. When it's just my wife and my daughter at home, he sleeps upstairs like everything is fine. But if my wife, daughter, and I, are all home and downstairs, he will come downstairs and act jealous through excessively barking for attention (and even after we give him attention he still barks for attention). We tried various bark collar solutions and the only thing that we've found to keep our sanity is a muzzle, but that only lasts so long as he will eventually start to whine and cry to get it off. So we will take it off of him and he will eventually start barking again. At this point, my wife and I are doing our best, but our old doggo is driving us up a wall and we're not sure what to do. Any advice or explanation of his behavior would really help."
429,[Help] Dog poop problems,dogs,t3_aa3gfo,10,False,False,aa3gfo,"Ok, I'll try and be as quick and succinct as possible. We have a 15 year old dachshund who took to pooping in her crate overnight. She'd poop in there and then bark until we came in to clean it up. She'd do it even if we let her out right before bed and she pooped then. We feed her once a day in the morning right after we let her out. 

To stop the barking and to hopefully stop her being trapped in her poop until we could clean it, we stopped keeping her in her kennel at night and started just leaving her locked in the bathroom with potty pads. That stopped the barking, but it didn't stop the pottying. Oddly enough, even though she had plenty of room and could get away from it, she would poop and then smash the poop down flat on the floor (it looked like she finger painted in there every morning and every bit of poop would be smashed flat). 

So she'd have to have a bath and I'd have to get down and scrub the floor every morning. Even if we tried to paper the floor with puppy pads. 

The last couple of nights we've tried switching her to diapers. That's worked for the mess- she still pees and poops in the diapers but at least it's not all over the floor. Today, however, after I took the diaper off and put her outside I noticed she was straining to poop again. She passed some but kept straining even though no more was showing. 

Using a wipe I cleaned up her bum and tried to see if there was something stuck and she passed the last little bit of poop. There was a little bit of blood but she still kept straining. After another few minutes, she got more poop out and then seemed ok.  

However, according to my wife (she's at home, I'm at work) the dog is asking to go out every few minutes and straining while she's out there. She's also pooped a bit more in her bed twice (solid) and just keeps straining every half an hour or so and generally doesn't seem as if she's comfortable. 

She's never been an 'eater' (that is, she doesn't chew on stuff or eat random things off the ground). She IS passing stool and it's normal consistency, not diarrhea or especially hard. There's been just a touch of blood but no more than I'd expect from just a sore bum. 

Any other thoughts what it may be before I get her into the vet? "

431,[Help] Is it ever too late to train a dog not to bark?,dogs,t3_aa18zi,4,False,False,aa18zi,"Hello!

My 2,5 year old dog (terrier/pinscher mix) barks a lot, especially outside at other dogs and I am overchallenged with it. I am suffering from social anxiety and the looks people give you when your dog is barking is really too much for me and I don't like it when other people make a mean comment regarding my dog, since I truly love her and of course don't want anyone to insult her. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory: My mom and I got the dog together but she mostly had her and was basically the ""pack leader"". Our girl was always way more quiet when I had her and when she barked my mother only rant at her until she stopped. Over the years it got more and more out of control and we got a muzzle which I kept using when she barked and it was really a help. My mother wasn't using it though because ""she looked so awful"" with it. We often kept fighting about it but she never really used it. 

Well now my mom isn't there anymore (not dead) and I have the dog alone and she is seeing me as her leader now. While she isn't barking much at home, she basically always barks at other dogs outside. At home I can easily use the muzzle and I really see that it is helping, but outside it's different. When we see another dog I always try to change the street or something but sadly that's not always possible and honestly I rather want to solve the problem now and not just runaway from it. 

Now you're probably wondering why I don't use the muzzle outside - my dog isn't walking when she wears it. At home she is moving a little bit like getting on the bed and walking towards me but if we are outside she doesn't even walk if I pull the leash a bit. She is just standing there and I'd basically had to drag her behind me to get her going, but of course that's not the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be very thankful for any help and advice since it's taking a toll on my social anxiety and I'd really like my dog and me to have a good time outside."

433,[Help] Housemates beginning to not get along.,dogs,t3_a9zvzr,11,False,False,a9zvzr,"First post here, but I'm stumped as to how to advise my parents on their dogs. Sorry if I'm a little disjointed or if the formatting is off, there's a bit to unpack here. 

   A little bit of background: They have two dogs (and one cat). Both dogs are the same breed (American Bulldog) and sex (female), but differ in age. The older dog is around 7, the younger dog is nearing 2. Older Dog came from a shady breeder as the runt and we suspect she was abused before we got her, although it doesn't seem to affect her regarding aggression towards people or other dogs. She plays well with others and is very much a people pleaser. 

   Younger dog on the other hand, is a little...off. She came from much better beginnings than older dog, but has ended up with a mild form of congenital ataxia. Whereas older dog was a very easy to train dog, younger dog is slow to pick up commands and very hardheaded. Younger dog also is very easily scared, but will respond with aggression. (Example: Her and older dog on a play date with another dog, Younger dog took a potshot she almost regretted but Older Dog stepped in and defended her until people came to break them up.)

&amp;#x200B;

We've been noticing a disturbing trend between the two dogs though. Younger dog is starting to pick fights with the older dog. Older dog will do her best to try to prevent a fight, but Younger dog is so bullheaded that she keeps on until Older Dog can't take it anymore. Fights will erupt (all instigated by the younger dog) over affection, food, toys, and occasionally an unknown stimulus. Older dog will give younger dog a wide berth because she doesn't want to fight (doesn't like making my mom or dad upset) and will avoid as much as she can until she can't. 

Usually when a fight erupts it's after Younger Dog stares down Older Dog (with Older Dog avoiding looking at her). Younger Dog will take a potshot, and then it's on. Older Dog, despite being avoidant, will throw down when she has to. The fight I witnessed happened behind me after I gave older dog some attention. Younger dog stared down and took her shot, tried to take older dog down and got grounded by Older Dog. Older dog will not clamp down to draw blood, but will pin Younger dog down by the throat until she stops fighting. However, the second Older Dog releases, Younger dog is right back up snapping and snarling until Older Dog puts her down again. 

This is different from their play fights. I feel this is a challenge situation over resources (including affection). But we don't know what to do about it. I'm not so worried about having to break them up because for now fights are only occurring when people are home. My concern is what will happen if a fight breaks out and nobody is home. I don't think Younger Dog will stop. I think she'll keep on and keep on until both of them are tired or one of them wins. And I feel bad for the older dog as well. She shouldn't be slinking around the house hiding and trying to avoid a fight from the younger dog because she was there first. My Mom has thought about rehoming the Younger Dog, but is worried that with her ataxia (mild as it is, she's just forever going to be a little clumsy like a puppy with paws too big for their legs) rehoming will be hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to tell them. I did tell mom it wouldn't be as hard as she thinks to rehome for such a mild neurological issue, but I understand that she would rather find a way to solve the issue in the house. All issues aside, Younger dog can be incredibly sweet. None of us like how it's affecting Older dog though, because this was her home first. 

Is there anyone else that has had experience with this issue? What did you do to remedy it? Or is rehoming the only answer?

440,[Breeds] Am I a stupid idiot for wanting a German Sheperd as my first dog post-phobia?,dogs,t3_aa2isp,19,False,False,aa2isp,"Hey all,

So 2016 - 2018 was the two-year period where I kicked my phobia of dog's ass - note, I didn't kick the ass of any dogs during this period, that would be awful - and now I'm at the point where I can confidently be around dogs and it's like I'm not even around em. I've been looking into dogs, and I think a German Sheperd would be a good choice.

Here are some facts that might be helpful for you guys:

I'm 18, but I won't be going to college (called University here in the UK) for a good two years, maybe even three, and all I'm doing is my post-high school study called A levels. This means that I have a lot of time to devote to dog walking, training, all that.

I am financially stable as I saved a lot of money from when I wasn't in education and I receive a monthly sum anyways. This means that I am certainly not unable to provide for the dog.

I have a lot of space - I live in a three bedroom house with a garden, and one of the bedrooms is unused, as well as the dining room. 

I hear that German Sheperds are quite clingy and love to be around family, which I think would be a lot of fun as I can 100% provide the time commitments (practically) all year around. If I was to get a GS, I would choose my University accomondation accordingly; I want to make it clear to you guys that I am fully committed to raising the dog!

EDIT: I'd like to point out that I just realised that I have a very active lifestyle that might really benefit a GS - I follow a military routine (long story, not in the Army atm but I really enjoyed the training haha), this includes sprinting on some days, running every day; generally good cardio stuff that (I'm pretty sure) the dog would enjoy.

I don't live with babies or small children. I live with my dad who is a warehouse worker who is constantly active, and my brother who isn't around too much.

QUESTIONAIRRE:

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Zero dog experience, but I love the buggers now that I got over the phobia. First dog, but not the first dog in the family - my dad had a dog growing up.


2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?


* No preference.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.


* Loyal, physical enough that I can have fun with it when I go out on runs and the like, protective.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* GS, they look adorable and I would like a tough yet loving dog. They seem very loyal too.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Guard-type stuff, but I may be able to get in touch with my friend who is a K9 trainer in the Army (the lucky git)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Literally as much as I need. I'm out monday-friday from 9AM to 5PM, but the evening is the dogs, and so is the weekend. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* See my main post, I do a lot of cardio and strength exercises outdoors and this seems like perfect GS territory.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Totally open to that! We have HEPA air filters at my house that are rated for dogs so I don't even need to worry about annoying hairs, and no one has allergies either :)

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

*Medium - big. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*Infinite, haha. I think it goes with the territory of owning a GS.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*Not important, but if I had to do that I wouldn't mind!

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

*Is there such a thing as a mixture of both? I'd lead more toward snuggly though.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

*Eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

*Wouldn't mind them making noise when someone knocks on the door. We rarely get visitors but it would be nice if they were friendly with them up to a certain level.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*Yep!

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?
Nothing that comes to mind as long as it isn't biting me a lot haha

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

*9 AM to 5PM when I'm at college, 9 AM to 3PM on Tuesdays. Family will be in but they have less dog experience.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

*Family are indifferent, but they'd feed the dog if needed.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*I mean, I might get a goldfish or something at some point, but no other four-legged friends!

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

*No. Very, very rarely - if ever.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

*No restrictions on dogs where I live, and I'll actually cater renting my Uni dwellings around the dog.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*UK, and the only restrictions are on the ""killer breeds"" that are bred to be violent; GS doesn't count.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*Summer days - Highs of 22 degrees celsius and lows of 11. Roughly 70 deg fahrenheit high and 51 degree low.

*Winter days - Really depends as the UK has a weird climate. Lows of -1 C (30 F) and highs of 7 or 8 (45 degrees) depending on the day. Lots and lots of rain though."

442,[Help] My senior dog is having a very bad post seizure recovery and is extremely hungry,dogs,t3_aa22bc,3,False,False,aa22bc,"My 13 year old pug started having seizures when she was around 9, they lasted about 30 seconds and she was perfectly normal right after. 

Two months ago she started having grand mal seizures that lasted about 3 minutes and were quite violent with a recover period of about 2-3 hours of disorientation. I started her on CBD oil and didn't have a seizure for a month. I switched to a pet specific one and I think the dosage was lower and I didn't realize I was only giving her 2.5mg instead of 5mg (20lb dog). She started having seizures again. Had 4 in one day and no amount of CBD seemed to help so I brought her to the emerg vet who gave me phenobarbital and gabapentin.

This was 24 hours ago and her seizures have stopped but her recovery phase is much much worse. She's been just screaming for the past 20 hours and her back legs barely work now. She's ravenously hungry, which I've read is fairly normal post seizure. But I think the screaming is from how hungry she is. I went to my regular vet to get something to sedate her because this dog usually sleeps 15 hours a day but has had maybe 4 hours of sleep. She was given valium and it helped her sleep for maybe 2 hours before she woke up and started screaming again. Food is the only thing that calms her down and she eats it like she's been starved. When I touch her, she sniffs my hand to see if I have food and will nibble a bit on anything around her mouth.

I'm worried it's all neurological and no amount of food with satiate her. I don't want to over feed her but I wonder how much can I give. After the first few seizures, she was running around constantly. 

I just want her to get some rest have to have the screaming stop. Has anyone had a similar experience?

TL;DR Dog had 4 bad seizures in one day. Is on phenobarbital and valium for it now and the seizures have stopped but she's screaming constantly and I think it's from hunger. Is it safe to over feed her or should I be doing something else to sooth her?"
443,[Help] The Worst Start to Owning a Puppy Ive Ever Had (on the verge of a breakdown).,dogs,t3_aa1qnt,12,False,False,aa1qnt,"I've always grown up owning dogs. I firmly believe man should grow with a dog to some extent. I recently became a licensed nurse, started making more, and finally got to a point where I could own a dog. A puppy even, if I made the needed adjustments. I work out as much as I can throughout the week, so the dog could get plenty of exercise under my care. Seriously I had thought of all the necessary provisions, dog sitters, food, researched breeds, kept tabs on the market, etc. I had it all planned out. Even though I work night shift mostly, I could make it work. I refuse to believe that I can't do this just because I'm single living in a 2bed apartment. And when he gets older, I can always drop him off at my mom's omw to work bc she has a huge backyard and that would be good for him to stretch his legs during the hours I work.

My sister, who lives in Denver, finds a puppy she wants out in the state I live. She asks me to get it for her and she will venmo me the money. It's a Boston terrier pup. Cute Lil thing, but he adjusted extremely well. I was able to play with the pup, attempted to train here and there, and even had a dog sitter for it. Now, the breeder I'm buying from fails to mention he will be out the day I wanna buy the dog, so now I'm pressed to buy sooner. I buy him yesterday early morning thinking I'm gonna have all day and night with the pups and then I'd have a dog sitter for the next day. His name is Roy and he's a border collie.

11:00pm rolls around last night (12/26/18) and I get a call from my work, ""where are you? You're supposed to be here."" Apparently, my schedule was changed without my knowing. Now I'm in full blown panic mode. What the hell do I do now? I start calling ppl up left n right, hitting up dog sitters via Rover - nothing. I tell my date that I had earlier that day (I didn't leave the two pups alone for more than an hour btw) my situation, not realizing she would volunteer to help. So she says she will take care of them for the night at her place. Not ideal, but I can't deny that opportunity. So I do this. Now I have them back, trying to get some sleep before I have to work a freaking double from 3pm to 7am which was also scheduled without my knowing. Now I'm on the verge of a complete breakdown. I haven't been able to give Roy a good couple of days all bc of some bs with work and I'm thinking this will dramatically affect him. I can't get him to use puppy pads and I wasn't able to introduce the crate to him in a positive way at all. Idk what to do and I feel like I'm overwhelmed and drowning. Like I'm genuinely about to cry and freak out bc I didn't plan on it being so rough for Roy. For the record, the Boston terrier is named Austin and he's been doing really well, but Roy isn't. I put them both in the same kennel (it's a large kennel) to see if it would help Roy but it doesn't. He is constantly freaking out like how I am right now lol. Idk if I'm going to be able to keep up. How fucked up is this situation and am I being too dramatic here? Should I call the breeder and send the puppy back bc I am on total freak out mode and suddenly feel like I cant do this anymore. Like Roy had such a bad first day that I feel I  can't even repair whatever trauma he may or may not have undergone moving around so much.

[UPDATE]
Sure enough, after Austin the Boston left, Roy is able to have a routine and is able to actually listen to me. Only other issue is that his energy level is WAAAAAY down. I mean he doesn't give a shit about treats hardly or toys. He has his first vet appointment scheduled tomorrow. I'm curious if he has something physiologically wrong, or if he's just this worn out. But he has been sleeping about 85% of the day. Not sure if he's still adjusting, or if he's worn out from the last couple of days from going to my mom's house and meeting everyone at my family reunion. I suppose the answer is obvious. He does come alive when he sees someone while we go outside for bathroom breaks. Like tail wagging. he shows me affection but never wags his tail. It's hard b/c I don't know what he wants aside from not being on a leash when we go outside (been training him on this almost all day). "

447,[help] what should we be looking for in a rescue/rescue dog?,dogs,t3_aa17l1,32,False,False,aa17l1,"TL;DR: are we asking too much for a rescue dog from a North West shelter? Dogs that fit this description are gone within the day and rescues keep sticking their nose up at us. Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog. 

Our wishlist for a dog: prefer small but only needs to be under 120 lbs (apartment restriction), cannot be a pit, gsd, or husky, must get along with other dogs and people, energetic and athletic, between 1 to 4 years old,

Sorry for the wall of text. This started as a question and has kind of turned into a vent with hope for advice.

So my husband and I are looking at getting another dog. We are having serious issues with finding a compatible dog and I am wondering if we are just asking too much or if we are just not looking in the right places.

Background: We are both from the south but are in the North West. We are definitely having a problem getting use to a completely different culture surrounding dog adoption. We are use to having tons of good dogs looking for adoption for anywhere from $25 to $100. Here the cheapest county shelter is $250, private groups start at $500, and the dogs are gone within a day or two.

We have decided to get an adult dog from a shelter for the ease and to skip the terrible puppy  stage. I have only ever had a dog I raised from puppyhood. My husband has never had a puppy and got his dogs as adults, but they also only had one dog at a time and the dogs were outdoor only dogs.

We have a 7 year old border collie mix who has lived with as many as 5 other dogs in a house and has never had any serious issues with any of them. She will never start fights, however, she won't run away when attacked either.

Problem: we have been looking at dogs since September and cannot seem to find a good match. We did adopt one dog in September but as soon as she became comfortable in the house it became apparent she was large dog/fear aggressive and would constantly attack our current dog (mostly over resources and proximity). This led to us returning her for fear that we end up having an ER visit or worse due to the fights (it got very close to needing an ER visit twice in the month we had her). It was a costly mistake as her adoption price was $575 and the rescue group black listed us because ""we didn't know how to handle dog with issues"". This rescue organization came highly recommend and they told us this dog ""didn't have an aggressive bone in her body"". They made no mention of issues before we adopted her but when I reached out to ask how to calm her down and get her more relaxed they told me ""she just needs time, she started fights when she first got here too"".

We decided to be more cautious, we have been more attuned to how our dog greets the other dog, how the rescue/shelter is organized, and really looking at the dog's personality. But so far we are always late and the dog is gone before we have made a decision on the dog.

We have also been avoided by a lot of rescues because we are young, in an apartment, and looking for a high energy dog. Our current dog is high energy and we really enjoy that energy level because we enjoy walking (walk a minimum of 2 30 minute walks a day), hiking, and are generally athletic people. I would also really like to get into dog sports. But the rescues always turn us to old, low energy dogs.I am really about to say let's save up and get a purebred puppy at this point even tho I hate the puppy phase.

Just in case you forgot (again sorry for the wall of text) the question is So are we asking too much? Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog.

448,[help] Is it possible my dog broke his nose?,dogs,t3_aa156v,2,False,False,aa156v,"Hey,

It‚Äôs been a few minutes and the sneezing has mostly stopped, occasional sneeze or half sneeze/trying to kind of thing. His nose now appears straight and I can lightly move it around with no yelping or hard pulling away or anything. 

  Think he‚Äôs fine ? He really didn‚Äôt even hit the chest hard I think he just went nose first and he‚Äôs got a pointy snout "
449,[Help] Which breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_aa144t,2,False,False,aa144t,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It would be the first dog we own. I have an uncle that owned and trained several Rottweilers and German-Shepards. So I was often around dogs in my life. Also walked them and played with them etc.

My wife was also around dogs as a child but never owned one.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We would love to rescue a dog. However, depending on the breed we heard that one needs to be careful with rescue dogs. The uncle I mentioned above recommend me to not get a rescue dogs as ""you can get a lot of baggage you do not know about"".

Any additional advice from you would be very welcome.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

A companion that loves being around my wife an me. He should be able to spend time with either me or my wife without ""missing"" the other too much.

He should be be able to hang on the couch for some time but also love walks/hikes/jogging and should not have problems with other dogs or children. We are not looking for a guard dog. However, there are a lot of children and other dogs around our neighbourhood.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I always likes Labradors, however we might think that they might be too big for a first time dog. I hear a lot of recommendation for this one as a first time/family dog. I also have a thing for Welsh Corgis. I understand that they might be very active.

We both find Beagles could fit us very well.

My wife likes Dachshunds and other smaller breeds. She would prefer a dog that she can lift up if the situation requires it.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Walking along side us, fetch, sit, speak/quite. The usual I guess. Nothing too exotic I think.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1 hour should be possible every day. More on the weekends.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I think 30mins each day are possible. We both jog every other day. So the dog would come with us. On the off days we would go for walks or play fetch in the yard.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We would prefer a shorter coat. If necessary all grooming will be done for the dog. A professional would be used if totally necessary but is not preferred.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and Slobber can be handled a lot. The neighbours would probably prefer the barking to be at minimum. However, they also have dogs and they sometimes bark too.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

We would love to let the dog run free in safe area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly most of the time.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

Is ""somewhere in between"" a possible answer? 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

As mentioned, we are not looking for a guard dog. Knocking at doors should preferably not be a problem. If someone enters the yard, it would be good if he barks.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

Would be great if the dog does not like to eat shoes, cables or tv remotes. But hey...thats just something you have to deal with when owning a dog.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home about 90%. On the days that I would not be at home, my wife could take the dog to work with her. I neither works, the dog would stay in the yard for about 8 hours. However, I cannot imagine that happening very often. 

If we would be gone for longer, my parents can take care of the dog. They also have a big yard.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My wife loves dogs and wants one too. We would share the involvement 50/50.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not at the moment. We might be expecting our first child in 1-2 years.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We own a house with a yard in the suburbs. No intention of renting.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in Graz, Austria. No specific restrictions come to mind.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer 25 to 30 degrees celcius
Winter 5 to -10 degrees celcius

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We have a fenced yard that is about 120 square metres big.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

450,"[Discussion] Wow, kids be dumb. Parents need to do their job.",dogs,t3_a9pn7u,71,False,False,a9pn7u,"Christmas was interesting for our 3-month-old pup. He has met kids before when we take him to the park, but this week he met the family kids (ages 7-10). I thought they would be at least a little knowledgeable about how to behave with a dog because they all have their own. I definitely overestimated there.
 
The kids don't listen. The first thing they did was run screaming down the street towards me and the puppy. I held up my hand and yelled to stop and slow down. Kids continued and parents did nothing. 
 
Playing with my puppy involved chasing him, encouraging him to bite their hands and feet, backing him into corners, getting all up in his face... I tried so many times to stop the kids and explain that they needed to let pup get to know them, let him sniff them, etc and don't invade his personal space. I tried to teach them about his body language and when it means they should back off. They didn't adjust their behavior and I had to babysit.
 
Kids be dumb. One asked, ""How come he won't let me pet his belly?"" I'm like, ""How would you feel if someone you just met came up to you and rolled you onto your back to rub your belly?"" Didn't make the connection.
 
We went outside to walk pup after dinner. Kid comes with us. He's like, ""Are we gonna run him around soon? Cuz I'm getting bored."" I'm like, ""We're not out here to entertain you wtf?""
 
Most of my last two days have just been a stressful mess of me having to take my puppy away from the kids to protect him. Or getting discipliny with them because their parents are off having fun.
 
People kept asking me, why don't I take him off the leash inside? 1) because he is 3 months old and doesn't know how to stay alive and 2) the kids harass him.
 
I try to put pup down in his crate for naps and the kids come bursting in like ""NOOO why are you putting him in a cage??"" He's safe in there and it's naptime. How about someone put you in a cage."

Right in the middle of his dump a small child screams ""husky"" out of nowhere and runs directly for him. Before I could even get to him the child was already petting him and running off before I could even say a word. Luckily my shepherd isn't to keen on small children so she just avoids them by going the opposite direction. I understand dogs are the best thing when you're a child, but you never know what is going to happen. Next time they might not meet a well mannered pup who loves kids, next time they might accidentally surprise the dog and get nipped, next time they might get bitten badly.

Some of the ""red flags"" I've picked up talking to him:

 * They're breeding ""mini"" Australian Shepherds. That alone put me on alert, at least.
 * I'm aware Australian Shepherds are a popular breed at the moment and fairly susceptible to this kind of thing to start with.
 * ""Breeder"" seems to only have one or a few pairs of dogs that they repeatedly breed, all parents live with the breeder both moms and dads.
 * hip/knee checks are limited to ""my local vet says the parents are good"" and I'm unsure about eye testing - all three are recommended by akc for Aussies.
 * Breeder has lied to him about what to expect from the breed. They told him a mini Australian Shepherd will be a ""great apartment dog"" and only need a short daily walk for exercise and no mention of mental stimulation at all. I'm not worried about his ability to exercise the dog, he's a fairly active guy, but intentionally misinforming your pup's new parent rubs me the wrong way.
 * He's having difficulty getting them to commit to a home visit for the puppies, so he can see them prior to pickup.
 * No wait list, no interview, no meeting. He saw an add, said ""do you have a puppy for me"" and they said yes.
 * The dogs are CHEAP. They're asking for $500 CAD for the puppies, when he States other breeders in the area (many of whom also sound shady) were asking for 1200-2k. Breeder claims that this and the previous two points are due to the fact this is her last litter and she's getting out of breeding, due to being older and having some health conditions.

I told him these are red flags, but I believe he's blinded by cute puppies, and the fact he can actually afford them. Is there any good explanation for even some of this, and if you're all as wary as I am, is there anything else I can do or say to change his mind? Puppy pickup wouldn't be for another two weeks I believe, so maybe there's time.

466,[Help] Breeders and health testing importance/transparency,dogs,t3_a9wcac,12,False,False,a9wcac,"I made a post a couple days ago asking for opinions on a particular breeder. This brought up a some questions for me regarding health testing. I had contacted and asked the breeder for documentation, or something similar, that I could see just so I could see if their dogs really were tested for PRA, MDR1, etc. I did not receive anything official from them besides reassurance that their results are accurate based on lineage (linage was not provided and I searched OFA but had no luck). Looking at other breeder sites I've seen some dogs that have a simple description like ""MDR1: normal/mutant,"" while others have full pedigrees and include registration numbers to make it easier to look up their dogs and such. Others mention the names/locations of doctors who have examined their dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

When contacting breeders what exactly is a good response when asking about health testing? Is official documentation (a record from OFA or some other form of documentation) the main way to validate health tests or is verbal conformation that they do health tests typically what you get (i.e. ""this dog is not a carrier for \_\_\_\_"") ? I personally feel like breeders should have some sort of proof to present buyers, but is this considered too demanding/rude? This is my first experience with a breeder and I am honestly not sure what would be considered acceptable/rude on my side regarding this. I would appreciate any input! "

468,[help] Extreme shedding all of a sudden,dogs,t3_a9x67e,3,False,False,a9x67e,"3 months ago we rescued a pit bull/Bassett hound mix who is approximately 2 years old. We have been feeding him Merrick food since day one and he has shed very little. 

With the last bag of Merrick food we purchased, we noticed the kibbles were larger which was odd. I emailed Merrick about it and they advised that the food can vary because it is all natural. My dog has never puked, but he has puked twice since starting this bag. My main concern is out of nowhere he has been shedding a TON. If you pet him, you end up with a hand full of hair. He has no bald spots but is shedding a ton. I returned the bag and switched to Acana food. 

My fianc√© gave him a bath today, the hair covered the tub and clogged the drain it was so bad. We are worried sick about our boy. 

The only other change in our home was a real Christmas tree, but he hasn‚Äôt gone really close to it or eaten any pines needles. We live in Illinois so the climate is cold when he goes outside, but from what I‚Äôm reading dogs don‚Äôt really shed their coats this time of year. 

He is still 100% himself and active and doesn‚Äôt seem sick at all. Loves his food and is playful. Should we just give it a few days to see if it was the food? Get him to a vet immediately? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you in advance.

Basically, we got a puppy in June and we have had him since we was 5ish weeks old. He‚Äôs a small breed, and we tend to think that we‚Äôre pretty good puppy owners. Leo is usually around other humans for roughly 20% of the day considering we put him up when we leave the house. 

Now comes the frustrating part. We could leave Leo for 12+ hours (obvi we wouldn‚Äôt do that) and he wouldn‚Äôt whimper once. But, the second the door closes to the bathroom he‚Äôs screaming his head off. Similarly, we recently moved Leo to the back seat for car rides and needless to say he hates it. Not to mention he‚Äôs still very bitty and requires constant attention.

We love him very much and would never get rid of him, but we need some suggestions on how to:
    1. Stop the biting (or will is stop over time) ? 
    2. Allow Leo to understand that it will be ok if we don‚Äôt see each other for 5 seconds, or if he‚Äôs not in our arms in the front seat. 

I understand we may not have made some of the best decisions in the beginning of training, but we did the best we could. 

Edit: so funny story as to why we got him at 5 weeks. We needed something hypo allergenic and we searched for a rescue for awhile and then came across Leo on Craigslist for a small fee. They told us he was 8-9 weeks old which we fell for and mostly just fell in love. When we took him to the vet the vet immediately knew he wasn‚Äôt 8. "

472,[Help] Our 15 year old has giardia,dogs,t3_a9unaz,11,False,False,a9unaz,"Sorry if I‚Äôm not doing this properly, I read the rules but I have never posted in this sub before. 

Anyway, our 15 year old mixed breed (Aussie shepherd/cattle dog/lab; usually about 50lbs) started having diarrhea about a week ago. After it didn‚Äôt subside for a couple of days, we took her to the vet and they did some tests and she was positive for the giardia parasite. She has been having explosive/watery diarrhea for about a week now. She is otherwise very healthy for a 15 year old. Declining a bit due to hip issues, but healthy for her age.

She‚Äôs on metronidazole every 12 hours with a full meal (chicken and rice/bland diet) for 10 days, and liquid panacur once a day for 6 days. She‚Äôs been on the metronidazole for 5 days, and the panacur for 3 days. Her diarrhea is definitely still there. She‚Äôs having tons of diarrhea accidents at night and it‚Äôs starting to get more watery. 

Since she is a senior, this has definitely knocked her down. She‚Äôs weaker and usually INSANE about food but isn‚Äôt very interested in her chicken and rice. She was the first couple days but now only eats most of the chicken. I tried putting broth in it and it didn‚Äôt make a difference. I know side effects of both meds can cause loss of appetite but I‚Äôm worried because of her age and her love of food. She is down about 4 lbs from her normal weight. She‚Äôs still interested when we eat human food and interested in our other dogs food though. Oh and she‚Äôs drinking plenty of water/urinating regularly, which is good to see. 

So basically my questions are- has anyone had a senior dog with this parasite? Most people I have talked to had this in dogs under 1 year old. How long did it take for the diarrhea to go away and did they fully recover?

Also, is there something we can feed her besides rice for a bland diet? She likes chicken but I feel like she isn‚Äôt getting enough calories. 

Sorry this was so long! I would love any feedback.

473,[Help] Dog humping all the time,dogs,t3_a9uhde,0,False,False,a9uhde,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have an 8 year old female scottie mix who is spayed.  She is humping ALL THE TIME.  We adopted a new dog several months ago - a male catahoula mix - who she seems to genuinely like.  She will climb into his crate with him and sleep, they each sleep on the same bed most nights, and they spend a lot of time together outside.  She's older and doesn't like to fetch and while he'd love her to play with him more rough, she's older and that's not her style.  So, no signs of aggression, they share bones, no red flags.  


However, the blanket in her crib is CONSTANTLY being humped.  Like nonstop.  She's humping all day and night right now.  She has humped a couple of stuffed animals before but very rarely.  The humping started several weeks ago and seems to have reached a high right when we had holiday guests (that she knows very well and likes).  I don't know what to do but say ""stop"" but she will start up again, inevitably.  The humping doesn't seem to coincide with the other dog ""bothering"" her or invading her personal space and she is clearly the alpha in the house.  If he gets too involved or careless, she tells him to back off and he will roll over into a submissive pose.  He's still very much a puppy, you see, and sometimes gets rambunctious.  Still, that doesn't seem related.  She just had a vet checkup and nothing is amiss.  They say it is likely due to the new dog and it should subside but it only seems to have gotten worse.  


It's a really annoying behavior, TBH.  Is there a way to train her out of it.  I don't believe in punishing either one of them.  And, her being a terrier, she won't do anything she doesn't see in her best interest.  We do occasionally have to medicate her for OCD and anxiety so maybe that would help?  She's a very neurotic dog."

476,"[Help] Going to dog parks/swimming areas, and keeping doggy healthy.",dogs,t3_a9wkaq,5,False,False,a9wkaq,"Hey everyone.

So beyond ""make sure your dog's vaccinations are up to date"" I didn't think I'd have to take precautions regarding doggo's health at dog parks, but after I started taking her she started getting eye infections. Her eyes were red one after the other and weeping TERRIBLY.

So we figured it was the water she was drinking (she loves snorkelling) so I've been taking precautions with that.

But my question's not about the eye infections. That's just an example of how something I didn't see coming impacted our outings.

The question is, **what kind of other health-related precautions do I need to take when I take my dog out to the dog park**?

IE:

* Picking up after your dog to avoid spread of disease (duh)

* Vaccines (also duh)

* I've been taking her own bowl with us so that I know the water she's drinking is clean, since the bowls provided tend to get muddy, and even making sure to empty it out and refilling it wasn't enough.

* I've been flushing her eyes out with saline solution after she's gone swimming, because her favourite thing to do is snorkel. (IE, stick her head under the surface, walk around like that, lift head and shake all over innocent bystanders, rinse and repeat.)

I don't want to be paranoid, but I'm just wondering if there's ""common sense"" issues that I'm completely unaware of that I should take into account.

Our mother's also concerned that our dog will get ""parasites"" from swimming in the lagoon, but I asked her for info and her response was that she was concerned the doggo would get amoeba up her nose or something. I'm... not even sure we can get brain eating amoeba down here in Sydney but maybe there is a problem with waterborne pathogens and I need to take more precautions to keep my dog safe?

**TL;DR -- After taking doggo out to dog parks and swimming and having to flush her eyes/have her only drink from her own bowl to prevent infections, it's left me wondering what other precautions I should be taking that I'm not aware of to keep doggy healthy?**

Also, there's storm water drains nearby -- should I be letting doggo swim near that, or is it fine? It's definitely storm water, not sewage."

How do we introduce him to our Maltese puppy safely?,dogs,t3_a9sazk,3,False,False,a9sazk,"On Saturday we'll take home a 4 year old St. Bernard from my wife's parents. He's spent the vast majority of his life locked up in a cage in their yard. He's been heavily neglected for the past almost 4 years, basically never played with, never groomed. His hair is under the neck and on legs is all tangled up and dirty. All they ever did was feed him. His water gets changed every couple days in the 20 liter bucket. You can imagine what that looks.

He hasn't received any kind of training. He likes us since we're the only ones who let him outside for a walk in the yard and play with him, but he's not very obedient of us, of course. I'd say he weighs around 65 kg (140 lbs). He's not been socialized with other dogs, and just introduced to a couple people.

Now I'm afraid how he'll react to our dog at home. The Maltese is 5 months old now. She's very curious, energetic, and fearless, which I fear could be to her detriment. I'm not sure how to approach introducing him to the puppy safely. He's not an aggressive dog, but I'm afraid he could get annoyed with her and bite her head off or something. So I'd like to avoid this. Them not ever seeing and meeting each other is not an option for me.

I also have some concerns about how he'll adapt to the new environment where he'll be free, and coming to another dog's territory, but that's a whole another issue. We're primarily concerned about the safety of the puppy, as I can see her being excited and jumpy around him. If not angry even. I'm not sure.

We'll also get the vet to come check him up immediately.

I have a 6 month old Siberian Husky, and she's the most energetic, crazy pup ever. She's literally always sprinting around the house and immediately demolishing any food we give her. That is, up until a day or two ago.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, she *always* eats her food. We've been training her to wait until we give her the go ahead so she doesn't just inhale it in two seconds. Either yesterday or the day before, though, she just kind of... stopped eating. She'll take a couple of bites of her breakfast in the morning and then leave it, then take maybe one bite around when she'd eat lunch, and then barely touch it during dinner time. She's still pooping normally which is strange to me because it doesn't seem like there's much going in, for there to be anything coming out.

&amp;#x200B;

She's hanging out at my mom's house tonight while I'm at work and my mom just told me that she ate some of her dinner and then promptly puked it all up and then some. She also didn't eat any of her breakfast this morning again.

We haven't changed her diet recently and she gets plenty of exercise.

Does this kind of thing normally happen with younger dogs? At what point should I start to worry or take her to the vet?"
485,[Breed] What breed is right for my family?,dogs,t3_a9uhrs,6,False,False,a9uhrs,"COPY/PASTE THE FOLLOWING FOR AUTO-FORMAT WITH BULLETS

Copy/paste the text below into a new text post..

Replace ""ANSWER"" with your response but do not delete the asterisk (*). Leave a space between the asterisk and your response.

Remember to include [Breeds] in the title of your post.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I grew up with dogs. They were all outside dogs and we lived in the country. I am in an urban area and am looking to get an inside dog.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I am wary of rescue's. I have children (3 &amp; 5), and their safety is my #1 priority. I would prefer to have a dog that could grow up with them in the house to avoid safety issues.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I would like to have a dog that isn't large (we own our house, but it isn't a big house). Is cat friendly, is excellent with kids, and is NOT high energy. Medium to small size would be best, with an excellent temperament. Also, I would like to avoid the smell of a hound (the beagle smell).

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Something like a Pug, that isn't all messed up. I really don't know what other medium to small breeds fit the bill of not requiring too much exercise.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands, sit, stay, recall.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work full time, so it will need be crated while I am at work (about 8 hours straight). I could probably make something work out while it was in the puppy stages to cut that timeframe different for awhile until it had a large enough bladder.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30 minutes to an hour. In the summer this number will be much higher since I like to hike (I would avoid hiking with the dog if necessary due to issues with its breed or size). 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Looking for as low maintenance as possible. Not looking to pay a professional. Maybe once a month.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Small to medium.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I would prefer less shedding and slobber. Barking I can handle as long as it can be contained by training.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important. If the dog is outside it will be on a leash or a lead.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I want it to be nice.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I don't have any tolerance for this.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggressiveness is a no go. I'm pretty hardline on this.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 8-9 hours a day while I am at work (at most, it varies with my wife's schedule).

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Their desires are reflected in this. I have two small kids (3 &amp; 6). My primary concern is that the kids are safe.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a house cat.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No. I own my house.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Ohio. I live in an unincorporated township.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers can easily hit in the 90's, winters can get pretty cold as well (30's).

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I am looking for a kid friendly, low maintenance dog that physically fits in our house and doesn't require a lot of exercise, but is able to hike.

486,[fluff] Our Christmas Eve stray.,dogs,t3_a9p758,31,False,False,a9p758,"I‚Äôve never posted before in this sub but I‚Äôve been following for some time, I thought this made for a pretty good post/holiday. 

My husband works in the oil fields in the Midwest US. Right now our temps are slightly above zero, freezing rain, terrible awful weather. 
He was working on Christmas Eve (having a shitty day, so was I) and when he went to a disposal there was a border collie roaming around. Super friendly, showed up a few days ago but no one at the disposal knew her and no farmers live nearby for miles. 
Meanwhile, her entire butt is severely matted, full of dried dead worms, (who apparently couldn‚Äôt make it out of the matting) she‚Äôs extremely bloated from the infestation, hungry, cold, and her pads are frostbit. She was wearing what looked like a 20 year old collar with no tags and it‚Äôs not uncommon in this state to dump dogs before leaving for home (out of state), or cowboys that don‚Äôt give a üí© about dogs (chained up outside in sub zero temps)

Husband realllllly tried to not add a second dog to our family.
But he brought her home. We had to shave the matting out (she couldn‚Äôt actually go to the bathroom because the matting was so thick). We‚Äôve fed her teeny meals throughout the day so it didnt‚Äôt shock her system, she actually managed to poop (hurray!) and she‚Äôs getting along pretty well with our resident (also adopted) male dog. They‚Äôve had some vocalizations but nothing violent. Thank god. 
She‚Äôll be going to the vet soon (within a week) to get looked at and get her shots.  She‚Äôs having a little hard time breathing, and she‚Äôs pretty lethargic and tired, but she really wants to be spunky and puppyish. We suspect maybe lungworms or an upper respiratory infection from eating roadkill/weather, so fingers crossed for minor health problems instead of anything severe!
And before anyone says it, yes, all precautions were taken, our dog is up to date on all vaccinations and he‚Äôll be receiving a round of wormer with her, they use separate areas of the yard and have their own space (just to clear that up). My husband has vet experience and grew up in a vet family so, we‚Äôre definitely alright. 

It‚Äôs funny to say, We were thinking about adding a second dog to our family for a while but decided to keep the space open because we seem to always stumble upon the dogs that really need help. I‚Äôm so glad we waited. 

Her name is Eve. 
Yes, I was going to default to Santa‚Äôs Little Helper if no one decided a name. 
If anyone has any tips for maintaining a peaceful environment between a resident and new dog, that would be great! Maybe ways to help them bond a little better? Or stories of how your dogs bonded, how long it took, do they just tolerate each other or actually care etc. This will be my first time having two dogs (not my husband‚Äôs), so I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences. 
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

487,[HELP] Hello Pupper People! I'm hoping to get some suggestions and insight on what I need to do to make a doggo decision!,dogs,t3_a9udxd,11,False,False,a9udxd," I  am a disabled man.  My physical conditions are tied to severe nerve  pain that's uncontrolled much of the time.  I sorted spend most of my  time home alone and really need a reliable pup pal to help keep me  company, but I'm going to have to be pretty specific about what things I  need and can tolerate and it's going to be difficult. You are all  smarter and more experienced than I am, especially considering I've  never owned a dog before.

This is what  I'm really going to have to consider before I move on with my thoughts.   I need to clear with my housing authority first, but the pet policy is  pretty open.

I will need to be looking at:

A medium (not small, please) sized dog with a low shed potential

A cuddle pup, one that won't mind climbing up with me on the bed and hanging out

Low  activity as far as room to run out high energy.  I am in a quiet,  somewhat rural neighborhood, but I can't have a high energy dog that had  to run, especially because I'm on a hill.  I have a park at the base of  my high energy that will be acceptable for walking.

I  know age is going to be a big thing when it comes to a tempered dog,  like no new pups for example.  I'm thinking 4-5 years, though I'll not  sure if it's a good goal or not.  I just don't want one that will pass  within a couple of years.

What breeds do you suggest?  What I do I need to learn first?  Male or female are both acceptable!

Thank you!!"
488,[Fluff] Skittish Rescue Remembers Home,dogs,t3_a9kl38,9,False,False,a9kl38,"I adopted a skittish rescue last winter, about 2-3 years old. He is very calm and gentle, hardly ever bark. I tried not to give him anything free; he is always asked to sit or do something for his meals and treats as I read that it is a good way to boost dogs confidence. But he still gets very scared so easily that he pees uncontrollably if we bump each other at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we went for a long walk all the way into the woods at the end of my apartment complex. I often have him off leash as he listens to me. Even if he runs off to chase a squirrel, he doesn't go far and comes back. It was different today; he chased something (for some reason, yelping while chasing), and I didn't realize the fence wasn't complete. He ran off and disappeared. I called his name and tried to find him in the woods for a while, to no avail. I realized I wouldn't be able to find him and walked back home. He wasn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought someone eventually would call me since he has a collar with my number, and he's microchipped. About 30 minutes later, I heard a bark (I don't recognize his bark as I only heard him barking a few times for the entire year). I thought it would be another dog somewhere, but opened the front door just in case. There he was sitting in front of the door. What a good boy. I always wondered if he is happy with me as I'm a first time dog owner. I guess he at least thinks this is his home to come back to."

491,[Breeds] What Type of Dog Would You Recommend for Me?,dogs,t3_a9u29m,10,False,False,a9u29m,"\*\*So I am finally paying off my student loans this week, and told myself I would not buy a dog until I paid them off. Now I am starting my search for my first ever dog (did not have one growing up) and could not be more excited! If you all could offer any help regarding the breed I should get or general advise, I would greatly appreciate it.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Growing up my family had a farm dog and some farm cats, but that was when I was in elementary school. I have not had any pets since then, though I begged and begged my parents for a dog with no luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I do not have a preference; however, if going through a breeder for a specific type of dog will reduce the risk of my dog having health issues, then I have no problem going that route.

&amp;#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* I want a dog who is fun and active and can hangout with me in the Texas heat outdoors, but when it comes time to relax at night, I want my dog chilling out with me. I'm a bit of an old man and don't do anything but relax past 9 PM during the week and go to bed around 11.

&amp;#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* On an average weekday, I would be able to take my dog on an hour long walk/run. I have dog parks in the area and my apartment complex will be finishing their dog park this coming spring, so those are an option as well. On the weekends I could spend  lot more time giving my dog exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would be willing to brush once or twice a week. Most grooming would be taken care of my a professional, and I am willing to pay for it as needed.

&amp;#x200B;

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

&amp;#x200B;

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Not that important.

&amp;#x200B;

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would prefer a dog that is neutral, but if I had to pick one I would want a snugly dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would like a dog that is eager-to-please.

&amp;#x200B;

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would like my dog to not bark, and be cool with visitors and strangers as I have family and friends over frequently.

&amp;#x200B;

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

&amp;#x200B;

\* On an average week, I work 8-5 but can come home during lunch for 30 minutes. After work, I come home and then go to the gym from around 6:30 to 8:30. I am then at home the rest of the night and usually go to sleep at around 11. However, I do travel monday through thursday every once in a while and my family has agreed to watch my dog for those weeks I do travel. Either it be my sister, grandma, or parents. On the weekends I am usually home most of the day, I do go to the gym for two hours on Saturday and sometimes will go out at around 6 and not be back until late that night.

492,[Breed] What dog breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_a9u23k,4,False,False,a9u23k,"Introduction

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my boyfriend and I's first dog as independent adults. We both grew up with dogs and I have been the primary care-taker/carer of our dogs since I was 12 (this includes an old special needs dog, and then a boxer and husky puppy which I raised, both of which turned out lovely and well behaved). 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a¬†reputable breeder?

I would prefer to rescue a dog, though my boyfriend has never had a puppy and wants to have one at least once so I agreed that if we can't find a puppy that fits our lifestyle in a rescue within ~6 months then we can begin looking for a reputable breeder. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.

While I personally don't mind energetic or vocal dogs (I love my husky more than anything) we will be in a one or two bedroom apartment with overall very limited space. So I would need a dog that is quiet and has at least controlled energy similar to a greyhound. I enjoy outdoor activities so it will be exercised but I don't want it to tear up my apartment if I miss a day. I also prefer dogs that are smart and think for themselves. Ex. In the case of my husky and boxer, the husky is very intelligent and quickly learned many tricks, but only performs them if he recognizes a mutual benefit. Whereas the boxer is very difficult to train but eager to please. She understands all of two commands but performs them with so much enthusiasm lol. I find it more endearing that my husky is so independent and headstrong but actively chooses to obey and be affectionate with me, whereas my boxer is just happy and obedient with everyone and no matter what so it takes away from the depth of the connection for me for some reason.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I prefer mutts, and otherwise the dogs I like are not well suited to apartments so I'm not entirely sure about this one.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I'd like for my dog to know basic commands at the very least, but I find that even the slowest of dogs (my boxer lol) are capable of learning basic commands so I'm not too worried about this. If they can be trained further that would be fun but I know that typically tends to pertain to higher energy breeds.

Care Commitments

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I am stuck at the hip to my dogs, so most of my time at home is spent with them. Focused one on one training I could do at least a couple hours a day until they're older, which would taper off to one hour.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

My boyfriend and I both enjoy going on walks so they'll probably get at least one long walk a day, maybe two. There are no dog parks in his area but local general recreational parks will be visited frequently where there are other people and dogs to interact with. Would occasionally visit trails but they're far off from our city apartment so not a regular thing.

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

More than happy to do any grooming tasks, I work at a vet clinic and am capable of doing most basic things but for any advanced/styled hair cuts (ie. Poodles, etc) I wouldn't mind visiting a professional groomer.

Personal Preferences

9) What size dog are you looking for?

I tend to prefer larger dogs but I'm not picky. I'm inclined to say a medium size breed would be better as I wouldn't want a large dog to be uncomfortable in cramped quarters.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I don't mind shedding at all, the boyfriend isn't a huge fan but it's not a deal breaker for him. Would prefer less slobbering but again not a deal breaker. Cannot be very vocal though unfortunately, I will miss my Husky's singing voice for sure!

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It's not very important to me as there are limited scenarios wherein my dog would be allowed off leash, but if they can be trained to do so it's definitely not a bad thing.

Dog Personality and Behavior

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly to the max lol

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

I'd prefer one that does it's own thing but still enjoys my company. 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

An unreactive dog would be better, as it cannot be very loud, and while I am ok with putting in the extra work to socialize particularly anti-social breeds, it would be nice if they were at least indifferent or receptive to meeting strangers and visitors. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Yes

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

I would like to avoid loud/vocal breeds.

Lifestyle

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Each week-day they would be left alone for ~6-8 hours depending on my classes and work schedule, but my boyfriend has finished school so he works 6am-4pm so he's consistently home in the evenings regardless. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Boyfriend is on the same page for the most part, no major disputes. He will help in taking care of the dog when I'm not home but I will be the primary care-taker.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We would like to have a cat or two and possibly other various small pets later on.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Boyfriend has a 4 y.o. niece who will visit occasionally.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No known restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Metz, France. In the past pitbull and mastiff type breeds have been banned, and supposedly still are, though they're common in the area so I'm not 100% sure on the situation and there's no info online, but to be safe will avoid these breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Moderately cold winters, 20-30F and little snow. Very warm summers 70-80F.

Additional Information and Questions

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Any mix of breeds is ok as well. I'm not too heart-set on any specific breed as I know each dog is an individual and tends to conform to their home lifestyle when brought home at a young age, but still would like to have a feel/expectation for the breed as a whole.

493,[Help] Does this look like Syringomyelia?,dogs,t3_a9uy1f,2,False,False,a9uy1f,"Just took my dog for a walk and my little guy is doing what appears to be a classic sign of syringomelia. He also definitely shows sensitivity around his neck and head and yelps if someone touches him there sometimes...He is 1.5 years old and I got him from a reputable breeder intentionally to mitigate the risks of him getting this condition (his dad is a champion show dog and comes from a good line of dogs).

Obviously bringing him to the vet but since it's late at night was just curious to hear all of your thoughts... video at the link

494,[Fluff] Some Christmas drama courtesy of our pup,dogs,t3_a9h1yf,76,False,False,a9h1yf,"Our 1.5 year old chocolate lab snuck up to the closet where we were hiding the Christmas gifts last night around 11pm. He found a pound of chocolate-covered raisins and ate them... all of them. We had a holy-shit moment as we collectively realized... Chocolate: bad. Raisins: worse! 

Thankfully, we discovered what he'd done relatively quickly. I called our vet's emergency number and the sweetest woman on planet Earth talked me through getting my dog to ingest some hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting, which worked right away. We've been keeping an eye on him, and it's now more than half a day later with no apparent illness, so I think we dodged a bullet.

This dog, man. He's a handful and a half but I just can't stay mad at him, especially on Christmas."
495,[Help] 10 year old dog - Collapsed trachea &amp; enlarged heart advice,dogs,t3_a9opmr,11,False,False,a9opmr,"I'm looking for any advice for my current situation. Our 10 year old family dog, Ozzy (Cairn Terrier Jack Russell Mix), has been dealing with a collapsed trachea and enlarged heart for a little over a year now. That's roughly when the coughing started.

I've watched it slowly progress into something that truly breaks my heart to see/hear. We've taken him to the vet many times, and have been given codeine + a water pill, since apparently he had excess fluid build up. He has moments where he is quiet, but even then, I notice this constant heavy breathing, almost like he is struggling. When he gets into a coughing fit, it has evolved from the standard ""goose"" sounding honk that comes from the cough, to more a sound that I can only describe as similar to when a human has a really ""airy"" and long laugh that comes more from them exhaling a ton/pushing air out. These can last for 5-10 minutes, and he will either pace around, or lay down with belly facing the ground, front paws out ahead, and resting his chin on them. He's recently got into sneezing fits during these episodes as well. 

The medicine we were given, I imagine, stops these episodes from happening more frequently, but any time he gets excited (which is a lot), they start up. We also have a 3 year old Black Lab/Shepard Mix, who is very gentle with Ozzy, but in recent times hasn't been able to play with him because of these episodes. It's difficult because some nights he'll sleep through the night, and other times he'll have us all up with that cough and breathing issues. The water pill also has him going out more, as expected, but he's recently started to have some accidents on the cough, which I'm presuming happen while he's coughing. 

His appetite is still pretty good during all of this, and you can tell his still has energy when we let him out, because he'll run as fast as he can (even though he'll start coughing during this). I guess I just don't know what to do. It really seems to me as if he is suffering more than he is ""calm"". Surgery for him is out of the question, especially for his age. I don't know whether I need to start thinking about having him put down, or do I try to get a second opinion somewhere else? 

I love this dog so much, but I hate seeing him suffer and just want to make sure I'm making the right decision.

Any advice/suggestions from you guys would mean a lot. Thanks!

We got a puppy pug. He's now 6 months. So often during the day, the older pug will find one of the puppy's toys and pee on it. Which prompts him to think it's time to pee and will pee right next to it.

This will happen even if they've been outside just half an hour before. When they're outside, when one pees, the other will likely pee right on top of that spot. This can go back and forth sometimes up to three times.

How do I stop this behavioral problem in both animals? The older dog showing that it's okay to pee indoors is not acceptable behavior and is teaching the pup very bad habits."

¬†¬†¬† 1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

¬†¬†¬† * I've owned a dog before as a family pet, (male Corgi cross we got as a rescue when he was 10) so I have no experience with training. This would be my first dog of my own.

¬†¬†¬† 2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

¬†¬†¬† * Would prefer to rescue if I can find the right dog for me but am open to both options.

¬†¬†¬† 3)Describe your ideal dog.

¬†¬†¬† * One that loves people and playing but is also chilled. Easy to train and obedient. Would prefer a medium-large sized dog. I want a dog which will be a great companion above all else.

¬†¬†¬† 4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

¬†¬†¬† * Golden or Labrador Retriever as I think these fit the preferences listed in Q3 but I'm open to suggestions.

¬†¬†¬† 5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

¬†¬†¬† * Basic manners is a must. Would like to train it to be comfortable in a crate/dog cage as a place where it's bed will be most of the time. Fetching and returning a ball. Other basic stuff like being well behaved around strangers and other dogs.

¬†¬†¬† **Care Commitments**

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

¬†¬†¬† * As long as I need to for the stuff listed above. I would probably want to devote a lot of free time outside of training to playing and generally being with my dog.

¬†¬†¬† 7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?¬† What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?¬† 

¬†¬†¬† * 2-4 hours. Live outside of a city so main exercise would probably be walks/hikes and throwing a ball for it to retrieve.

¬†¬†¬† 8)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?¬† Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?¬† If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

¬†¬†¬† * If possible I'd be willing to groom it myself every day and if not then I'd be willing to pay a professional but would prefer a lower maintenance dog which wouldn't need regular hair trimming.

¬†¬†¬† **Personal Preferences**

¬†¬†¬† 9)What size dog are you looking for?

¬†¬†¬† * Medium or large

¬†¬†¬† 10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

¬†¬†¬† * Would prefer less slobber and barking but not too bothered about shedding.

¬†¬†¬† 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

¬†¬†¬† * Important but not absolutely essential.

¬†¬†¬† **Dog Personality and Behavior**

¬†¬†¬† 12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

¬†¬†¬† * Both would be fine but snuggly would be better

¬†¬†¬† 13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

¬†¬†¬† * Bit of both
¬†¬†¬† 
¬†¬†¬† 14) How¬† would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?¬† How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?¬† 

¬†¬†¬† * Don't mind barking as a first response but would like a dog which could greet people in a relaxed way and not aggressively.

¬†¬†¬† 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

¬†¬†¬† * I would prefer if it wasn't but would be willing if necessary

¬†¬†¬† 16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

¬†¬†¬† * Resource guarding, aggressiveness and escape attempts

¬†¬†¬† **Lifestyle**

¬†¬†¬† 17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

¬†¬†¬† * Probably 8 hours, 4 or 5 days a week, I'd be willing to hire a walker if necessary.

¬†¬†¬† 18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

¬†¬†¬† * No specific preferences and as it would be my dog I would take on the main responsibilities but may ask my brother to walk the dog occasionally or be alone with it if I had to be out.

¬†¬†¬† 19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?¬† What breed or type of animal are they?

¬†¬†¬† * Only other person I'd consider would be another dog if the breed I chose would be better off with a buddy.

¬†¬†¬† 20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

¬†¬†¬† * No

¬†¬†¬† 21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

¬†¬†¬† * Don't rent currently but may need to in the future

¬†¬†¬† 22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

¬†¬†¬† * UK, banned breeds are Pit Bull Terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasileiro under the Dangerous Dogs Act

¬†¬†¬† 23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

¬†¬†¬† * Average for summer is around 20-25¬∞c and for winter is around 4¬∞c

¬†¬†¬† **Additional Information and Questions**

¬†¬†¬† 24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

¬†¬†¬† * No additional information

¬†¬†¬† 25) Feel free to ask any questions below.¬† 

Will the sex of the dog make a difference to its personality, if so, would you recommend male or female for my preferences?

I also understand that golden retrievers can be prone to some conditions such as skin conditions, is there another breed which is similar in temperament and personality which aren't prone to health issues?

Is there anything else I should know about or consider when it comes to what breed or age of dog?

Thanks!

He's always done it to some degree, but it feels like it's gone up a notch. It is summer here, but even in the colder months he was doing it.

No.

 1. Describe your ideal dog.

A big affectionate dog that's up for a long hike but able to relax and nap when we're done. My only complain with the current dog (Aussie Shepherd) is he doesn't EVER turn off. I'll run him 6 miles hard and he still wants non stop playtime all day. It can get a little frustrating.

503,[Discussion] Do dogs have a special connection with the people who were there first?,dogs,t3_a9vyg0,3,False,False,a9vyg0,"My brother bought a dacshund puppy two years ago, but had to give her up about three months later. He gave her to his friend's sister. After not seeing her for nearly two years, he got to see her this week and she wouldn't leave his side.

A year ago my brother got another dog (that he still has to this day). He was only two months old when he got him. My brother was busy and asked me to take care of his puppy for a month and a half after having hin for only five days. I was the dog's only caretaker during that time. My brother was out of state and didn't visit, so unless my friends were over or we went to the park or vet, I was it.

504,[help] any kennel cough home remedies?,dogs,t3_a9vxx3,1,False,False,a9vxx3,"Hello all,

I‚Äôm here to talk about my little guy Benny. The fianc√© and I adopted him last Sunday. Sunday he was fine, Monday he was fine, Tuesday he was perfect. Before we went to bed Tuesday night, he coughed out a little bit of flem. We made nothing of it, and got some sleep. Wednesday we woke up, and he had been throwing up white foamy ‚Äúflem‚Äù and it persisted all morning, afternoon, and evening. We have an appointment for him tomorrow. The assumption is that he has kennel cough. He was vaccinated for it early December. When we called the adoption center, they called us over to go pick up antibiotics, which he later threw up. Now we have an appointment tomorrow morning, but we are are obviously very concerned. Is there something we can give him just to get us, and most importantly him through these next 10+ hours? 
We are camping out with our little buddy in the living room tonight. Will probably be up most of the night. 

So far the only thing he has been able to hold down is some chicken. He held it for about 45 minutes. Any times he drinks, or eats his kibbles, he throws up. He‚Äôs been throwing up randomly. Now he‚Äôs just laying in his little bed next to us. 

We were told not to take him to urgent care considering because they didn‚Äôt deem it to be serious enough.

505,[help] my old man,dogs,t3_a9vsot,3,False,False,a9vsot,"I've had my old friend for almost 11 years- ever since I adopted him at 8 weeks at an animal shelter I worked at. He's been a great companion for most of my adult life. 

But just within the past couple of years, there's been a decline in his overall health and personality. He stopped eating for awhile and I started using wet dog food to help entice him to eat his dry. (He's now on a grain free dry mix that he eats with interest) 

He started getting a bad rash during the summer so I thought it was seasonal allergies, but it stuck around. I'm giving him weekly baths with 3 different shampoos to help with his itch (which they do greatly!) Where he chewed most of the hair off on his hind end, it is growing back in. 

He started going to the bathroom in my daughter's room and just recently would pee on the Christmas tree, all while we are home and able to let him out. He basically stopped telling us he needs to go outside. So he has to be in an office when we aren't home. And 10/10 he uses the bathroom in the office which has been a big stress at home. The other night, we were home all day and he was let out many times, but he still went in my daughter's room to poop while we were in another room.

He acts like he can't hear us at all. Walking up to him and brushing past him makes him jump. And he basically ignores us or looks at me blankly when I groom him or pet him. He use to show an expression of love or Joy whenever I sit next to him now it's kind of blank or sad.

It has been stressful the past year or so and we are on a tight budget currently so I can't take my 65+lb dog to the vet and afford the check up.

I guess what I am asking for is advice. Someone asked me if it's time to put him down. But I felt like it was only necessary if he was in pain. I'm not sure if he's in pain. He just isn't the same dog anymore and it's sad with him seeming so depressed and disconnected.

I got a nice diffuser for Christmas and I'm in love with it! Problem is that I just read that it may be harmful to dogs, I'm seeing conflicting articles online about it. I don't know if it is just from injestion from the oils or the smells that cause them harm (or none).

Now background: My dog puked three times today and yesterday (total not each day). Once in my basement, once in the car, and once in the kitchen. I assume the car and kitchen one was from the car ride, because she gets carsick.  As for the time in the basement: that is not where I keep the diffuser. She has always been a puker because she eats grass and socks (we are trying to get her not to eat them and take them away when we see her have them).

Anyway, I assume they are unrelated to the diffuser, but I need to know because I am an extrenely paranoid person and obviously don't want to hurt my dog. If it is the diffuser, should get rid of it or at least not keep it on near my dog? Thank you.

512,[Help] 4yo dog tore her ACL,dogs,t3_a9p2ir,13,False,False,a9p2ir," My 4.5-year-old doggo has torn her ACL, and my heart is broken for her.

I brought her in again and after xrays, the vet suspects a torn ACL, as well as arthritis. 

The vet told me I have two options - $4K surgery or strict rest and anti-inflammatories for life. She and I are both very active, and since she‚Äôs so young, I feel like the surgery is non-optional. She‚Äôs everything to me and it feels so awful to watch her have to lay around all day with no exercise. However, I‚Äôm fresh out of grad school, and $4K is going to be such a tough amount of money to come up with.

515,[Breeds] Is a Silken Windhound or a Windsprite right for me?,dogs,t3_a9plbi,1,False,False,a9plbi,"Formatting is off, sorry!

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first, I have two herding breeds that I got when I was in my mid-20's - I adopted an adult from a show-line breeder and purchased one as a puppy from a working-line breeder.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I'm certain that I'll only be able to get either a Silken Windhound or Windsprite from a breeder, so I'll go that route. I'm okay with either an adult needing to be rehomed or a puppy.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* What I'm looking for in this particular dog is a nice house pet that's ready to play/train/work when asked, but also okay with relaxing when asked. We have a fairly laid-back lifestyle so I'm looking for a dog that will be okay with that. My two current dogs are extremely willing-to-please herders, but that level of biddability is not something I'm necessarily looking for in my next dog. Trainability for basic manners is a must. It would also be really nice to have a dog we can bring to cafes and shops and such.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Silken Windhound or a Windsprite, but I'm not sure about the difference between the breeds. We've been involved with greyhound breed rescue in the past and enjoy sighthounds.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* This dog will primarily be a pet, although it would be nice to dabble in agility or coursing with it. I take agility classes with my current, younger dog, and I'm hoping to compete with her someday. We've actually had quite a few sighthounds in our agility classes, and it'd be nice to try it out with a Windhound or Windsprite, although I'm 100% aware that the training process will be vastly different with a sighthound than with my balls-to-the-wall herder. I take rally classes with my older dog, and we hope to compete someday, as well.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* To be honest, I wouldn't be *that* interested in training with this dog other than basic manners or CGC-type training, and possibly dabbling in agility. This dog would primarily be a companion animal. If it happens to take to agility, I would of course be ecstatic about that and pursue it, but I'm not expecting it to be a fantastic sports dog right out of the gate. 

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* 1 hour of walks or leashed hikes daily. There's a fenced park right next to our house that would be ideal for off-leash running if needed. My current dogs and I hike off-leash almost every day, and we put on a lot of miles during the weekend.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Yes to everything, would be willing to brush briefly daily.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-large. I've fostered greyhounds in the past and found them to be lovely dogs, but too large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle a moderate amount of shedding and barking, but I hate slobber.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* My current dogs are great off-leash, and I walk them off-leash in the woods every day. However, I'm not necessarily looking for that in my next dog and am 100% okay with them being leashed at all times.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine, but snuggly is better. I understand that sighthounds can be a bit aloof, and I'm okay with that.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Either is fine.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* My preference is that they'd greet strangers and visitors with friendly curiosity rather than a boisterous, loud greeting. I'm okay with alert barking.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, especially because I have two current, resident dogs. My house is not set up for a crate-and-rotate situation, nor am I willing to manage that behavior.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* Human or dog aggression/reactivity, resource guarding, escape artists. Prey drive *may* potentially be an issue (please see below).

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* We have regular, full-time work schedules, so potentially up to 10 hours a day. We already hire a dog walker to come mid-day for our current dogs. We also send our dogs to daycare 2 times a week.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My partner likes dogs and would help with 50% of caring for the dog, except for the sports-related and training activities - I'd be doing all of that.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* So this is the main problem I might be up against. I have two cats, which may pose a problem with prey driven sighthounds, but I'm hoping that raising a puppy or adopting a cat-friendly adult will help with that.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. We have relatives with small children (1-6 years of age). We'd supervise all interactions and would crate/separate when necessary.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope, we own our house.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in the United States. Sighthounds aren't banned here.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* We live in New England; summers here can range from 70-95 F and winters can range from -10-40F with snow and ice. We're willing to invest in clothing to keep a sighthound warm during the cold winter months.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* I'd like to know what the differences are between Silken Windhounds and Windsprites. My understanding is that Windsprites will be extremely close (if not identical) to Whippets in temperament, but my understanding of Windhound temperament is a bit unclear. I've met a couple in the past and they've seemed very typically sighthound in personality. They were a bit aloof, loved to nap, and had gentle, mild temperaments. One of the Silken Windhounds I met was good off-leash, but I understand that this may be the exception rather than the rule."

&amp;#x200B;

Facts:

I would like to have a medium sized dog close in appearance/character to a border collie. I just love how they look, how smart they are, and how active they are. I intend to get such a dog mostly because it will be an incentive for me to exercise, and I'd love teaching him or her new tricks and keep him/her busy.

It does not HAVE TO BE a purebred dog and in fact I would PREFER a non pure-breed but with a LOT OF BORDER COLLIE in it so it retains characteristics (size, cuteness level, etc, most of this is personal preference, some of it, such as size, is practicality).

As this point I am NOT really considering adopting a shelter dog as my family has had trouble (real, real trouble) with them in the past, and I simply have (learned) too much respect of dogs' teeth to be comfortable with a dog I haven't raised myself. (Feel free to change my mind.)

&amp;#x200B;

All right. I've long thought about getting a dog and will probably think a while longer until I'm sure I want to be THIS responsible (I have a track record of being irresponsible that I'm trying to change). A discussion with my partner last night made me think and research more closely into health-issues purebred dogs can have.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two questions in particular:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) If we get a purebreed dog, what should we look out for? My partner says it's a matter of looking at a family tree and seeing if at some point in the dog's ancestry (although no further back than say great-grandparents) the dog's line was mixed with some other breed, which would minimize the chance of dog suffering from some sort of inbreeding condition. Is it that simple?

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Is it possible to find a breeder who will deliberately mix in a different breed every once in a while to ensure the dogs are as healthy genetically as they can be?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else we should consider before getting a dog? The actual acquisition of the dog might still be some time off, but I'd like to know as much as possible beforehand to prepare for it."

I‚Äôm fostering a 2 year old Boston terrier that hates everyone except for a few people (she is very sweet and loving with me, my boyfriend, and a few other select women) and I‚Äôm trying to curb this behavior. It‚Äôs not just that she‚Äôs scared or dislikes other people- she can be downright aggressive. Lunging, growling, barking. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôd actually bite someone and I obviously haven‚Äôt tested it. She does it no matter where we are (though I‚Äôve been trying to not take her in public until I know how to handle this), though she‚Äôs specifically much worse with men and she‚Äôs MUCH worse at home than anywhere else. 

This is something I knew I would have to deal with (she was like this at the shelter too, I actually was only able to take her on because I work there and she really took to me while I was working with her. They would not adopt her to anyone or allow the general public to foster her), but now that I have her I‚Äôm not sure how to handle it because I‚Äôm so afraid of her biting someone (shelter policy is that if she bites and it breaks skin/needs any medical attention, she‚Äôll be put down basically. It‚Äôs harsh) that I don‚Äôt even know how to begin working with this. I have some very understanding friends that are willing to help me, as well as the entire shelter staff, but I‚Äôm not sure what the best way to go about this is so that I don‚Äôt make the behavior worse. I don‚Äôt want to make anything worse by trying to help. It‚Äôs worth noting she‚Äôs extemely protective over me. She‚Äôs aggressive with new people regardless, but she‚Äôll even growl at my boyfriend, whom she loves in general, if we play wrestle or he accidentally hits me or something. 

Thank you guys so much in advance! I really appreciate the help. I‚Äôd like to add she came from a pretty shitty home so your probably sad assumptions about why she hates men and acts this way are most likely valid. "

521,[Help] An Aggressive Golden.,dogs,t3_a9ne6b,29,False,False,a9ne6b,"Sorry on mobile. 

Hello, I‚Äôm looking to see if other people have had similar experiences and if there‚Äôs any tips or strategies anyone could offer. So my sister has a 1 year old Golden Retriever and he can be quite aggressive. When he was a few months old he started to resource guard, take his toys into his crate and growl if you went near him when eating. He‚Äôd also pounce on you if you went into his crate to clean. 

As he‚Äôs gotten older he‚Äôs started to become aggressive in that you could be petting him and he‚Äôs enjoying it then he‚Äôd turn so quickly and snap at you. He‚Äôs caught my sister a few times and he bit a close family friend who the dog has known since he was a puppy, it was so bad she had to get a tetanus shot. 

He‚Äôs snapped at my oldest niece for petting him and my sister doesn‚Äôt let her toddler anywhere near him without his muzzle on as she‚Äôs scared that he may snap at her. 

The resource guarding has gotten better, as in you can be near him when he eats just no touching. He also does lunge for anything thats not his and does usually give it up with no treat. It‚Äôs more the petting issue. He does warn you when he‚Äôs had enough as he will lower his head and there‚Äôs a twitch in his upper lip that if you don‚Äôt stop he‚Äôs going to attack. 

It‚Äôs certainly not what I would say is normal for the breed and he‚Äôs not suffered anything traumatic since my sister bought him from the breeder though I cannot for sure say nothing happened to him when he was with his litter. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this or are there any tips anyone could suggest? 

Edit: Just an edit I‚Äôve mentioned in a reply but I should set the record straight. Regarding the muzzling this was a misunderstanding by myself. He wares a halter to help with lead training which doesn‚Äôt cover the full mouth it‚Äôs a band over the mouth to help control him when he‚Äôs out as he‚Äôs quite strong and used to pull when he was younger. He‚Äôs actually really good outside and there‚Äôs never been a problem with aggression or anything of the sort when he‚Äôs out walking. "
522,[HELP] How much do Pomeranians shed around the house?,dogs,t3_a9szel,11,False,False,a9szel,"I finally got permission to get a dog but preferably one that doesn't shed much. From my research I understand this breed sheds a lot, however it can be controlled by brushing, baths, diet, etc. This is a breed I'm very interested in and am really trying to find a way to calm my parent's worry about the shedding.

I plan to buy a Roomba to deal with lose fur on the floor and am willing to brush the dog daily for 15-30 min. Of course I'll also give the pom baths as often as the vet recommends and a diet recommended by a vet as well. Is that enough to deal with the shedding? A little dog hair getting everywhere isn't a huge issue but if it's balls of hair or covering all the furniture then it'll become one. I'm not too keen on brushing the dog AND vacuuming the furniture daily to keep my parents happy so if it comes to that this might not be the breed for me. "

**My dog**:

* I've had my dog Roman since he was 8 months old. He is a rescue, pitbull terrier mix (45 lb) and is 4 years old
* He was abused before and so is scared of a lot of things.
* He has bitten 1 of my brothers friends a couple years ago
* He lunges at other dogs and people he dosent know. Once he knows someone thought he is an awesome dog.
* very attached to me get nervous if I leave the house for 10 minutes but seems fine with my work schedule just not when I come back and try to leave again.

**The situation**

My girlfriend and I, who I lived with broke up and so now its just me and Roman. I moved to a new state because I just changed career paths. I have paid thousands for training and his hip surgery. I also pay a lot to have a dog walker come every day in the middle of the day to take him out and hang out with him for 30 minutes. I also cook his meals cause he loves it.

My family are not dog people so I constantly hear how a young professional shouldn't have a dog and I should give him up and so on. Ive been told to give him up and get a dog who is friendly and trained from a breeder.

**My Question**

What can I do? I cant have people over I cant take him to other people's places, no dog parks. How can I make him this happy dog I can take to a barbecue and let go without worrying? Im in the beginning of my career and I cant spend too much money but I am willing to commit time and effort.

Also any advice on how a single person can manage a social life when they live with a dog (also travel once in a while)? Would getting a second dog give him a buddy to hang out with while I'm at work or the gym?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am getting so frustrated and I just wanna hear from some dog lovers who understand that giving up my dog is not an option."

My wife and I have been together for 4 years and married for a little over a year now. We're both active duty military and was stationed in separate states prior to moving in with one another. Well I proposed in 2016 and luckily she said yes but out of the blue she just needed to have a dog.  I told her we're in the middle of planning a wedding and now wouldn't be a great time to purchase one.  I said wait until after we live together then we can get one. That wasn't good enough she pestered me for weeks to buy a dog and after weeks of bothering me like an idiot I told her yes.(first of many mistakes) She didn't just go to a shelter and adopt one like a normal person she goes and spends $3000 on a French bulldog(Yes, $3000 for a French bulldog in the middle of planning a wedding) She wanted surgery done so she shelled out another $8000 for her surgery and $2000 for boarding/training for the new puppy.  Yes within a month my wife drops 5 grand on a puppy.  She's excited and I'm annoyed haven't met the dog and already aggravated.  When I visit her in Virginia(I was living in Maryland) I finally saw him and he was a cute little thing but I noticed something(first red flag) she always kept him in the kitchen away from the house.  I'm not a dog person by any means but even I understand that you can't keep them in the crate away from everyone all day that's just cruel.  So I gave her some suggestions about how to be a better pet owner.  Then she asked me could I let him outside?  Nothing crazy about that but she never put him on a leash just allowed him unrestricted access to the yard because it was easier that way.  Then every time I visited her she asked me if I could walk, feed, and give her dog potty breaks and would get upset if I didn't. Quick story I don't dislike dogs but after my baby sister was mauled by a great Dane and needed stiches in her foot I've been cautious of them. It didn't help that I was chased by a stray Rottweiler for 6 blocks when I was younger so don't have warm memories of them. Finally we get married and after months of this I get fed up and confront her about it.  Why do you pawn him off on me when I'm around it seems like you don't want to fully take care of him.  She told me that I'm her husband and it's my job to help her take care of him.  If you don't help me with him this is going to cause issues in our marriage now suck it up and deal with it.  As much as I didn't like that answer like a fool I shut up and dealt with it.  I asked her to potty train and house break him before we move in together.  She tells me she will deal with it when the time comes.  Well fast forward to when we finally move in together and he pees on the floor within 24 hours of moving in.  I look at her and just shake my head and she gives me an uneasy I'm sorry.  Then after living with her for the past few months she's pawned 90% of the responsibilities on me. Now she hardly feed him, take him outside to relieve himself, bathe him, train him etc.  He's still not house broken and pretty much sits in a 8x6 pen all day.  I told my wife that I'm not helping her spend 2000 on training if she's unwilling to follow the instructions given to us by the trainers.  The breaking point for me was she got upset about having to take him outside to use the bathroom. We just had our child (as cute as she is she's a handful) and now Kuro(the Frenchie's name) is second to her.  My wife makes no effort to spend time with him, walk him, etc.  I understand that my daughter is a lot to deal with while I'm at work but my wife got overwhelmed with him as a puppy and needed help taking care of him.  Maybe I'm being selfish but I work a second job on top of being active duty military, I'm in school(take two classes every 8 weeks so that I can obtain my bachelor's degree), I just recently welcomed a baby girl into my life, my mother was diagnosed with Lupus and diabetes, and I'm also preparing to leave the military in the next 16 months.  Wife wants another child in the next year or two. Oh I also am going to start volunteering at a hospital and go to community college so that I can start pre-med prep to try to attend medical school in the next 5 years.  I understand fully that my plate is full and I'm unwilling to give my free towards.  Now she's wanted to give the dog up and I stopped her because I know she would resent/blame me for this.  I said this is a fucked up situation that we're in but you can't pawn most the responsibility on me.  You brought him into this relationship and is expected to contribute the most.  I will help you but asking me to take care of your dog on top of everything else I do is unreasonable.  Also we've spent 7 grand in surgeries, vet visits, pet sitting, food and toys.  I told her he's starting to become expensive.  She insist on keeping him but I think at this point it's selfish to do so.  I told her if we're both unwilling to train him and all he does is sit in the pen all day then why is he here?  I get no emotional fulfillment out of the situation and I've been asked to take care of this huge commitment. We're going to marriage couseling but I have brought it up yet.

527,[Breeds] Seeking a PTSD service dog,dogs,t3_a9sq1q,8,False,False,a9sq1q," 

I'm seeking a PTSD service dog for my partner, but the dog will be owner-trained (as is the norm in our state) and raised from puppyhood by us instead of being purchased from a service dog organization, so we're kind of ""on our own"" when it comes to figuring out a breed.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, my partner and I have both had many dogs growing up and as adults have successfully raised a Pembroke corgi, who is our pride and joy. We primarily have experience with herding breeds but from what I understand they are not necessarily good PTSD service dogs as they tend to be reactive themselves.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We are definitely going through a reputable breeder so we can properly expose the dog to all situations from a young age. There are no young shelter dogs where we live.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Laid-back, not reactive, not anxious, friendly, easygoing, doesn't require a huge amount of exercise, large to extra large, kind.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* We're thinking a golden retriever is our best bet, but are open to other breeds. My partner has a fondness for GSDs but we feel the exercise requirements are going to be an issue as well as the tendencies toward reactivity.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The dog will be a service dog for my partner with PTSD and will be expected to perform those duties, which will include cueing when my partner is going to have a panic attack, leading him out of the store if he has one, etc.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* We both work from home and already know that our corgi gets many hours of attention each day, so it would be the same with our second dog. He is quite spoiled. :)

1. How  long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of  exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that  include using a dog park?

* We don't want a dog that has high exercise requirements. Our corgi gets a 30 minute walk every day, plus about two hours of more intensive play and training in the backyard (flirt poles, tug of war, fetch, etc.). A dog that needs more exercise than that isn't going to work out for us. Which leads me to greyhounds as a possibility, but we have cats and I'm not sure I'm comfortable having a greyhound around cats (especially cats that are allowed in the backyard, where there's plenty of ""chasing room"").

1. How  much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming  hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you  be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Daily brushing is a norm here. I'm comfortable with grooming at home but don't want a dog that needs frequent professional grooming. Trims at home are one thing.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Large to extra large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Our corgi is very quiet so I'd prefer to not have a barker. Shedding is fine. Slobber is fine within reason.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* The dog should be reliable off-leash in case my partner's hands are shaking and he drops the leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please.

1. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or  entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or  visitors?

* Alerting is good, but not a liability if that makes sense.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, definitely not.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression or prey drive towards humans, dogs or cats. Reactivity.

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Honestly, almost never, because the dog will be with my partner 99% of the time when we go out.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* We are both dog lovers. I will be assisting with caring for the dog and training. We do not have kids, but will be adopting eventually.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, we have a corgi and two cats.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, eventually, once we adopt.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own a house, no restrictions.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* New England, USA. No restrictions.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers are 70-90F degrees, winters are around 20-30F degrees.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* No additional questions."

540,[Help] What breed would fit me as a first time owner?,dogs,t3_a9r286,4,False,False,a9r286,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I'd prefer a puppy from a reputable breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Friendly, Loyal, Intelligent, Not extremely high energy.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

At the moment I'm thinking of either a Golden or a Lab. They seem to fit what I'm looking for but I'm interested in finding out about more breeds.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

At least the basic stuff but I'd be interested in learning them other cool things as well.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I work from home so I'm pretty much always home. I can interact with the dog a lot.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I'm not the most active person on the planet but I can excercise the dog as much as I need to. Except for breeds like Huskies etc probably.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I can brush the dog every day if that's needed. Cleaning ears and stuff is probably something I'll have to get used to but I'll be fine.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

Preferably a large dog

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding isn't a problem. I'd prefer a dog that doesn't bark too much. It's fine when there's someone at the door or something, but not the whole day. Slobber is also something I'll get used to after a while.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not very important but I do have a big yard which the dog might like. It's unfenced tho and I have cats who are outside sometimes (The cats live in a seperate house on my property with my parents).

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I'm fine with either.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

I'm leaning more towards eager-to-please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

The only people that come to my house are friends and family so I'd prefer a friendly greeting.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I live in the middle of nowhere so there's no other dogs here really but if I come across someone with a dog while I'm walking my dog, I'd rather not have a dog that's aggressive.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

Nothing I can think of right now.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home so I'm almost always home, except when I go to the store etc. I do like traveling but I'd take my dog with me. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I live alone so no other people involved.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I have 4 cats who live in a seperate house on the property but they do go outside. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No, no children here.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

The Netherlands. I'm not aware of any banned breeds. I'll have to do some research.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: about 26 degrees celcius, with the max around 33 but that's rare. 
Winter: About 0 degrees celsius"

I'm thinking of making some paracord dog harnesses for my dogs, as I find the harnesses (especially ones with the front loop) make my dogs pull less. We also don't like the idea of choke collars and the leash pulling solely on their neck. The ones pictured above seem like pretty good designs. I understand the first design isn't exactly a harness, but I like the design of pulling the head down, and looping below the legs and behind the shoulders.

However, I have heard some people say paracord can be too rough on a dogs skin/fur, while some say it's fine. Do you guys see any issues with these designs, or using paracord in general? I love saving money and making stuff on my own, but I also want to double check the opinions with fellow dog owners to bring to my attention of any flaws or concerns with making a paracord harness.

Thanks!"
546,[Help] Dog acting off,dogs,t3_a9qdck,7,False,False,a9qdck,"My dog is a 2 year old Great Pyrenees named Daisy. We noticed the change in her behavior last night. She walked into my room last night, but after a couple steps, she backed up really fast into the corner and would not move from a sitting position. Usually, she'll come in and lie down beside me. She wouldn't move for about 20 minutes. She would whine at me (I was laying in bed) and nervously shift. She only whines at the door if she needs to go outside, but she didn't need to.

My sister picked her up to take her down stairs, but she refused to go. Eventually my sister got her to go into her room and she slept there the entire night. My sister said she hardly moved the entire night. Daisy usually moves around a lot, and she doesn't like to stay in one place for long.

This morning she followed my sister downstairs, and I let her outside, but as soon as she stepped out the door she turned around real fast and came back inside. Daisy's breed is a herding dog, and they love being outside. At this point I thought maybe it was her shock collar bothering her, so I took it off and made her go back outside. She stayed out there for about 3 minutes and then whined to come in.

Now she won't move from her spot by the couch. I'm thinking maybe she's sick, but I'm not sure. I could really use some input.

Update: So I've ruled out stomach problems. I brought her some food and she got up to eat it. "

548,[Help] My Portuguese Water Dog...is a horrible swimmer?,dogs,t3_a9qbzr,7,False,False,a9qbzr,"Hi everyone,

I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog. He's a pretty normal dog with the typical PWD quirks. We spend a majority of the time around water (a large lake mostly) on boats, at the beach, etc. Which was a large reason for getting this particular breed. The one problem we have had is that Max can't really swim. He splashes a lot, doesn't move his back legs at all and ends up vertical in the water instead of horizontal. When I have gotten in the water to try to ""show"" him how to move his legs, he just goes limp and I have to carry him back to shallow water where he can stand. We have tried getting him in the water with other dogs, but it hasn't really helped. Has anyone had any success overcoming a problem like this? Or did I just adopt the Water Dog who can't swim? Appreciate the help.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: He doesn't seem to be afraid of water, he actually enjoys being in when he can touch and seems to forget that he is a horrible swimmer. So, it doesn't appear to be a confidence/fear issue."

He loves them and they spoil him. He has constant interaction and access to the outside while he is there and never has an issue if he's just visiting for the day.

If my husband and I need to travel for a few days my parents will watch him during that time. That's when he strikes. There is one spot-always the same spot- that he poops in during these overnight visits. We've tried cleaning it, using chemical repellents, taking him on excessively long walks, etc. etc. but he still poops in that same damn spot!

My mom has taken to just putting plastic down there (he still poops on it). He never does this if my husband and I are there, he doesn't have incontinence issues at our home (where he can stay alone for up to 8 hours on weekdays) or even at my parent's house on single day visits. He never pees just poops and only on over night stays in their house and in that same damn spot. 

We don't think it's the ""new"" environment because it isn't new and we moved houses 2 years ago and he's never had an issue at our new house. They also sometimes take him to their second home a few hours away and he's never had an issue there either.

I‚Äôm prepared to put in the time to properly train it when it‚Äôs a puppy. I‚Äôm usually only away from home for 7-9 hours Monday-Friday for work and I do have a lunch break where I can come home to let it out to go to the bathroom if that‚Äôs too long to leave it without a bathroom break. If I travel, I take all my pets with me rather than hire a pet sitter or board them at a kennel. Right now it‚Äôs just me and two cats. I own my own house so having to okay having a dog with a landlord is not an issue. I have a fenced in yard. I live outside of town so there‚Äôs not a ton of car or people traffic.

3. What would be a good breed for a first time owner as an adult but having had experience with dogs as a child (just not the full responsibility of taking care of them)? I want something small (not more than 20-25 pounds), probably a toy to miniature size dog, preferably fluffy (I don‚Äôt mind putting in the extra grooming effort that comes with a fluffy dog or paying a groomer regularly if necessary) that is also sturdy enough to go on hikes or to the beach with me, is adaptable (like if I were to travel with it during  summers or if I were to get involved in a serious relationship after I got the dog [adding a new person into the dogs life possibly]), and is good with cats (I have two currently and they‚Äôre both young so hopefully not going anywhere anytime soon)."
564,[Help] Dog suddenly barking at people she knows,dogs,t3_a9kxkq,0,False,False,a9kxkq,"So I've posted before about my dog with anxiety issues, she has made a ton of progress in the past few months with walks but now she has a new problem. The whole first year we had her, she didn't really bark at all. Only a couple times while playing with other dogs at the dog park. Then about 5 months ago she started barking more at cats/squirrels, ect. Then at Halloween a kid in a mask tried to pet her without asking and it really scared her and she barked like crazy at him while backing away. Ever since then when people come over or right now when we're visiting family, she barks at people when they come in (which I guess is normal?) but then she singles out a random person (seemingly random) and will bark at them like CRAZY. We tried having them speak calmly, give her a treat, sit next to her with us and pet her but we always end up having to put her in her crate to get her to stop barking at them. It's getting worse. Today she would not stop singling out my aunt (she has met her before and was fine.) There was a room full of people (mostly close family that she loves) and she would not stop aggressively barking at my aunt. How can I get to her stop doing this? What is the best way to respond when she does this?

TLDR; how do I respond when my dog barks at my friends/family?"

Just today, we had company and everything was absolutely fine until a relative of mine touched his ear. He growled, she backed off, but a while later she tried to pet him again. He immediately jumped on her and barked, and then showed his teeth, growling. However, I've pet him including touching his ears without any signs of aggression from him.

They believe she's a Whippet. She's a rescue dog. They have had her for a couple years now so she's full grown.  The more interaction she's had with me the more she seems to try and avoid me. It's been a little over a year of this with me trying various things like petting, giving her treats, putting food in her bowl, trying to give her no indication I'm trying to hurt her, etc..

I've never done anything to or in front of this dog to make her afraid of me. Im the 2nd person she's ever treated like this otherwise she's entirely friendly to anyone else. Im just at a loss for what I could possibly do. Any advice would be helpful.

573,[HELP] Bailey likes to wonder...and pee in the house.,dogs,t3_a9kh81,1,False,False,a9kh81,"I've had my dog for two months. She has some quirks that need ironed out but really, I consider myself very lucky. Considering she's had no formal training (starts in a couple weeks) she's very well mannered. 

The two biggest issues we've noticed is her escaping and her peeing in the house. 

**Issue 1:** Bailey has escaped 3-5 times in the two months we've had her. Once a week after we got her, she pushed passed my wife and out the door. It was a rainy day and I chased her in socks. She found her own way back in the front door after a while. And twice today she escaped from my parents yard (a fenced yard she's been in several times). Today she simply jumped the fence. They have a lower 4' chain link fence. 

At my house we have a privacy, board on board,  6' fence. I'm not too worried about her escaping my yard BUT I'm disappointed she can't use my parents yard to run around in as it's much larger (about an acre). 

For Christmas I got a Whistle GPS device for her collar. I've also ordered a light up collar for her. 

She's microchipped. 

**Issue 2:** She's never been house broken (that we know of). However, she seemed to pick up on house breaking pretty quickly. She goes to the door. But, if you don't make it to the door to let her out in a matter of less than a minute (sometimes less than 10 seconds) she'll pee right at the door. 

She's also more likely to have an accident at my parents/in-laws house, despite having visted both multiple times. I don't expect her to be super great about asking to go out at other people's houses but, I figured it's worth noting. "

I'm hoping that some of you can help me figure out how to convince my father to unfortunately, put our dog down.

For some back story, we currently have a German Shepherd, she's 11 and half years old and has had a wonderful life. Unfortunately, over the past several months her physical health has been on a decline and of recent, has gotten to the point where you can't watch her walk. Her back legs have loss muscle, and even with meds, she has been unable to walk very well. My parents have wooden floors which for sure doesn't help. I got a floor rug to cover most of the living room and smaller pieces so she can go to the back door. On carpet, she is able to walk but on wood, it's like ice. In the morning, she is able to walk but throughout the day, it becomes more difficult till the night where she pretty much settles in where ever she lays down since she can't walk, for the night. 

The issue is her quality of life just seems like it isn't what it should be. Occasionally dragging her back legs, sometimes having to stop where she is and lay down till she can gain energy to walk, hardly walk down the two small steps on our porch to go to the bathroom. It all is just so hard to see but my father insists she's doing ok since she hasn't lost an appetite, drinks her water and still very playful. Her mind is there but her physical ability to walk is seriously not ok. I need help trying to sit my father down and telling him it's time, it's very hard to no matter what but I would like any advice any one has that had dealt with the same situation. "

This is not something she did for her first year. She used to absolutely love everyone and want to meet them all. She did have several vet appointments over the summer (spay, eye surgery, hip sprain, small skin rash from swimming) and I‚Äôm wondering if that may have had anything to do with her fear of strangers? 

She has also over the past couple weeks been barking nonstop when she goes outside. She never used to do this. She still doesn‚Äôt ever bark in the house, but she will bark at anything and everything when she‚Äôs outside in the backyard and since it wasn‚Äôt something she used to do I‚Äôm just not sure what‚Äôs going on.

I don‚Äôt believe she was trying to be confrontational, but she made a comment that she didn‚Äôt believe it was right to have such a large breed live indoors. She told me ‚Äú I wish I could bring my dog indoors, but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not right. He‚Äôs a large dog and he belongs outside.‚Äù

I told her I thought my dog was well stimulated, that he goes to daycare 3 times a week, the other days he gets 1-2hr walks at various off leash parks (a lot of them trails, more like hikes). At home he spends most of the day laying around sleeping, or chewing his bone. For 6 months I have had absolutely no problems with him chewing things he‚Äôs not suppose to, messing things up, peeing/pooping in the house, anything like that. He has free range of the house while I‚Äôm gone. At night he sleeps in his open door crate by choice.

To me, I‚Äôve always learnt that this means you‚Äôve met the needs of your dog. A sleepy dog is a stimulated dog. When I asked her about this she said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a lazy dog, but he‚Äôs probably still really bored.‚Äù

What do you guys think?! Am I being crazy? Should I be doing more for my dog? I always thought I was doing a good job with him.  I‚Äôm not about to move to a farm, but I want him to have the best life he can.

602,[Discussion] Single working travel nurse- want to get a dog!,dogs,t3_a9gsyb,28,False,False,a9gsyb,"Hi guys, I am a travel nurse and I am  thinking now would be a good time to start thinking about getting a dog.  I was wondering if there is anyone out there with some experience  having a dog as a single person who works.  I have had dogs when I was  younger and lived with my parents, but the logistics of dog ownership-  especially in the beginning phase seems difficult. Rescue? Puppy?

I  am not sure how comfortable I am having a puppy alone for 13 hours  during the day, even if someone came to walk them, which would be my  plan.  I only work 2-3 days a week so I really do have more time than it  seems, but even so.

Rescue dog? I would  really love to be able to bond with my dog from a young age, and get a  breed that isnt super anxious and could be good at the dog park, which  is looking difficult in the rescue world so far...

She's never done this in the past 14 years, but when she eats out of her glass bowl instead of eating or dumping it out and eating she'll literally put her nose in it practically lift the side and drop it over and over as well as push it back against the wall. This can last anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. Afterwards she might eat a small snack from the floor or she may not. Even if a pile of food is spilled all over the floor she'll still perform this bowl banging ritual. Please help reddit. Before I go crazy. You wouldn't believe how annoying it is when you hear glass banging on the ceiling at 4am and it wakes up your 2 year old. We used to leave the food out all night because she likes to graze instead of gorging one big bowl for meals, however if it keeps up I think I'm going to end up taking the food up after 9pm lol.

607,"[Discussion] As Christmas approaches, please be alert to Parvovirus symptoms",dogs,t3_a9bqeg,8,False,False,a9bqeg,"Hi /r/dogs

I adopted the sweetest lab/shepherd mix on Saturday from the Portland shelter. She was spry and playful and amazing, but as the day went on, she was throwing up, had diarrhea, and gradually lost all of her energy.

I was very worried about her not eating and being lethargic, but I convinved myself she was overwhelmed from being adopted.

The next morning (yesterday), she had blood in her diarrhea and continued dry heaving. I immediately called a local emergency vet and took her in right away. I knew something about parvo but as a first time dog owner I've never experienced it. The vet took a stool sample and within 15 minutes diagnosed her with parvo. He was extremely solemn and kept saying that things didn't look good. I was a huge emotional wreck. I've been looking for an emotional support dog for about 5 months and basically loved her within 30 minutes. I felt so bad for her.

We called the Portland humane society and they immediately, and without hesitation, told us to bring her into their hosptial immediately. They took her in at no cost. She's currently being treated with IV fluids and monitored in a quarantined unit with her sister who was adopted the same day and also came down with parvo.

I still don't know what to make of it. They say her tail is wagging and she is ""perky"" but still has bowel issues. The vet seems optimistic but I'm still anxious.

So please, please, read up on parvo. A lot of people are getting puppies tomorrow morning and there is always a risk of these puppies being exposed to parvo. It can kill your puppy within 72 hours if you don't call your vet at the first sign of lethargy, vomitting, and diarrhea.

I'll make sure to update this post as I hear more from them...

I went downstairs to find dog poop on the couch, a place she's never pooped before in the almost one month we've had her. The poop didn't look any different from her usual poops.

I also found vomit made up of pretty much undigested dog food on another couch. 

This all happened around 4 hours after she ate.

She's in her crate now as it's her bed time. When I put her in, she was a bit more restless than usual, rolling around and changing positions, but as of right now she seems fine.

It's also worth mentioning that we were at a relative's house today for Christmas, and I took her for a walk around the neighborhood. My worry is that she must have eaten something off the ground, but I had my eyes on her most of the time and didn't see anything."
609,[Help] dog experience hair loss and fur turning white,dogs,t3_a9g3uz,2,False,False,a9g3uz,"Backstory,

In June I took my dog (2 1/2 year old female spayed pitmix) with me to Dallas. During the car ride she sat in the back seat and the a/c was blowing near her face. Arrived in Dallas to the whites of my dogs eyes being pink/red. She began rubbing her eyes and keeping them closed. 

Returned to Austin and took her to the vet. Was given medicine for eye irritation. 

Eyes improved.

A week or so later her fur on the top of her head because to have large dry flakes of skin and she was losing hair. 

Back to the vet, she was diagnosed with having a bacterial skin infection.

Was given medicine over the course of 10 days, she improved. 

Fast forward to October...same thing dry flaking skin on head, muzzle and even her nose peeled and is now discolored.

Was taken back to vet and diagnosed with another bacterial skin infection. 

Same medicine and was also given an allergy shot.

Weeks go by and the skin stopped flaking....her eyes are no longer irritated but physical changes have taken place.

They dark hair around her eyes has not grown back, her nose is still discolored, her muzzle is now white and the once flaky spots on her back are now filled with white hair.

She is now losing hair starting on her hind legs. It‚Äôs moving towards her tail area. 

I‚Äôm at a loss. I plan on taking her back to the vet Friday. I do not feel as though the vet looked into the root cause deep enough at the beginning. 

Any suggestions? Do I try my same vet again or go to a new vet? Her physical appearance is night and day different. No dog that is two years old should have fur that turns white and be losing this much hair. "

636,[HELP] I thought I wasn't a dog person... Turns out I just hate my boyfriend's dog,dogs,t3_a8whm2,288,False,False,a8whm2,"***update***

So I've started letting Louis out more frequently and I don't actively encourage him to drink water at night as I used to do.

He's more manageable now at the very least. Here still complains if left in the cage with no one else in the room but I consider that to be semi reasonable and I work at home so it's inconvenient but not a crippling issue.

He can't be trusted to walk around the house unsupervised because he will still Mark and hide the larger puddles of pee in hard to get to areas. The local humane society was closed for the holidays but once they get back open I'll set a date for his fixing.

One of his major bad behaviors is humping aggressively and uncontrollably for the first few days we were here Dixie barked at him and visibly restrained herself from killing him because all he wanted to do was barrel across the house with his snout stuffed in her crotch. He still does a certain amount of this and I have to imagine this will stop altogether one he's snipped.

We lost his leash in the move so I'll have to get a new one, those of you with specialized knowledge and/or experience I'd appreciate if you have a recommended leash for a 3lb dog.

BTW a lot of you have developed some misunderstandings here. I mostly haven't corrected people because I didn't think it was terribly germane to the subject of dogs or having a dog but I'll at least offer some peace to those of you who appear to have gotten the most excited about the situation.

1. My boyfriend insists that Louis' behavior was better before we moved in together. He feels guilt over the fact that in a four-year period Louis has had to change homes 5 times with Louis not even being 6 years old. His defensiveness is centered around that guilt and the conjecture that that stress of constant moving has caused Louie so much stress that he's regressed and acts now like he did as a new puppy. (I know that can happen to humans but I'm not super sure that's a thing that can happen to dogs).

My boyfriend even goes so far as to suggest that Louis is acting out in retaliation to bad treatment. I may not know dogs very well but I was a behavioral Neuroscience major so I know for a fact that only the most intellectually advanced social animals are capable of calculated indirect aggression of this sort. I no longer argue with him on that point I just roll my eyes and try to change the subject to doing something more productive than hand-wringing.

 
2. We only have Louis because my boyfriend's previous partner neglected them both, to go out and cheat with other men. So he got stuck with Louis in part because he bonded while trying to keep the dog cared for as his real owner ignored him and part because Louis was a companion during bad times. 

3. My boyfriend has trained dogs up to a decent level of behavior before. He owned pitbulls as a child and successfully trained a St Bernard named Bruno up from puppyhood to be very well behaved (or so his relations tell me). Bruno got hit by a car when he was 4 years old, two years before my bf and I met.

4. We both have ample experience with children. He raised his niece as a single father from 15 to 23. I'm satisfied with his ability to impart good values to a human. I co parented my nephew with my sister from the time I was 11. So I'm not particularly concerned

5. This isn't super relevant but a lot of you seem to think I'm a woman. As a 6'2, 270 pound man this is a rare and amusing experience for me.


***Update***

I always wanted a dog growing up, I come from a Caribbean family and we were not particularly close to other animals. what's more, my mother always feared dogs and not without good reason; my older brother got mauled on the legs pretty badly when I was about four or five.

so I went into adulthood knowing that there's a lot I would have to discover if I ever became a dog owner.

As of about 3 years ago I moved in with my boyfriend who already owned a black chihuahua named louie. And I f****** hate this dog. He pees in the house constantly no matter how many times you take him outside, he steals food, is incredibly disobedient, sometimes it will randomly take a s*** in the house. We tried crate training and all he does is whine and bark constantly until you let him out at which point he will choose one or two spots around the yard to pee in and then expect to come back in the house to relieve himself the rest of the way. Worse than that he will start baking in the middle of the night to be let out, sometimes its 3, 4 or 5 a.m. at which point I wake up make sure he gest something to eat &amp; drink, then let him out to do his business.
that wouldn't be so bad except when I bring him back inside our room and put him back in his cage to sleep next to us he just starts whining again, there are times when he'll do this five times a night.
 Worse yet, my boyfriend is a heavy sleeper who never hears him so it's always my job.


from this experience I just assumed that maybe I'm not a dog person.

But we recently started renting a room from my boyfriend's mom and she has a deaf Pitbull-mix, named Dixie. Dixie is objectively, the goodest girl, despite being deaf she always listens to commands, never steals food, always wants to cuddle, holds her bowels or bladder for half a day if she needs to, she's gentle with children, loves to play but isn't rambunctious and is generally a respectful lovable dog on all levels, I give her a kiss on the forehead Everytime I see her. She is a joy to have around and I feel bad whenever people don't make time for her.

So now I've discovered that I don't hate dogs, I just hate this particular chihuahua Louis. The hatred is deep enough that I have actually thought to myself that if Louie dies or gets lost I need to remember not to seem happy because I'm sure my boyfriend will be devastated. The other day I was preparing some candy to take to the old folks home where my boyfriend works.  I stepped away for a second and Louie jumped up onto the furniture and ripped into one of the bags.

The candy is not that expensive so I was only moderately angry about the fact that he made a mess but I actually thought to myself that I wished I had bought dark chocolate instead of cheap milk chocolate for the residents so that maybe he would've just died from eating it without anyone blaming me specifically.

my boyfriend insists that he doesn't need any training and that we just need to get him fixed which for the record we've only had the money to do in the last week or two(we used to have roommates that never paid their rent so money was always tight up until now and we didn't want to ruin our credit by breaking a lease).

I'll happily get him fixed but I doubt that these crappy behaviors are purely the result of having testicles. I'm just barely tolerating this dog as it is and I'd really like some guidance 

I know Chihuahuas live a long time so I'm hoping I can find a better solution than praying for the death of this creature.

637,[help] when to know to say goodbye? :'(,dogs,t3_a9943y,6,False,False,a9943y,"I have a 13 year old pitbull. She has really bad osteoarthritis in her hips and back legs. This has created severe mobility issues. She can only take a few steps at a time. rarely stands up on own. She has been in this condition for 2 years. My husband and i carry her outside, bring her water and food, etc. She still eats normally, has normal regular bowel movements and has control of her bowels and lets us know when she needs to go outside. She takes joint supplements, a NSAID, and CBD oil. Lately she seems to be in more pain. Panting more, whining more, where we can not figure out what she needs. In past it was typically communication for a need like water, food, outside, repositioned etc. Now she will continue whining after trying to give her all her basic needs. So im assuming its pain. Last few moths she seems more depressed and uninterested in anything that used to give her joy. She was a licker and anytime we were near her she would strain to give us kisses. Those have stopped. We have a wagon and wheel her around the neighborhood to sniff things, she no longer has an interest or gets excited on those trips. How do I know when it is time to say goodbye. Im struggling because her internal organs are functioning fine at the moment. I have tremendous guilt for thinking about this just due to pain and mobility. Is it her time? and I being selfish for holding onto her? What if she's not in as much pain as i think? I always thought I would know for sure when it was time but I have so many doubts right now that I don't know what to do. She will be the first dog I will have to make this decision. lost a dog to cancer in June and he died peacefully at home so mother nature helped me out on that one.

I need to drive with her for 500 miles after the holidays (it was either that or leave her at a boarding facility but her high anxiety makes that close to impossible). Normally in a regular vehicle she likes to ball herself up behind the drivers seat (on the floor behind between the rear seat and the back of the front seat). She feels most comfortable there in a very tight space (secure) while being close to us. 

Our upcoming trip will be in a different vehicle (Eurovan) that doesn‚Äôt have rear seats or any tight spaces so I‚Äôm looking for ideas on how to make her more comfortable. Ideally she would be between the seats in a very tight, secure spot. I‚Äôm considering making a small wooden box with three sides she can jam herself into if she wants.

Our current dog is a golden retriever. He is almost 2 years old. And while he was a tough puppy when we first got him he has turned into an incredible dog. He knows over 30 commands, walks well on a leash, and absolutely loves other dogs! His favorite place is the dog park and he tends to be the most popular dog there. 

We have a pretty established routine down. We take him on an outing every day. Whether it be a long walk, a trip to the dog park, or up to the mountains for a hike. 

We are looking for a slightly smaller breed than a golden retriever, probably around 2 years old, and are hoping to adopt from a shelter.

She was found as stray few years ago and scooped off from streets.

But, aside from that, my dream has always been having a bunny too. Are there any dog&amp; bunny owners here? What should I look out for?

646,[Help] Training advice for new puppy,dogs,t3_a97tfn,4,False,False,a97tfn,"Hi all,

My gf and I adopted a Siberian husky puppy two weeks ago and we‚Äôve been having a blast with her. She‚Äôs incredibly smart and doing really great with the introductory training things. She‚Äôs actually the most chill puppy we‚Äôve ever seen and we are frequently told that.

The only issue we‚Äôve repeatedly had since getting her is when we have to leave and cannot take her with us. 

For example, every time we leave to get food or go to church things which take less than an hour and a half to two hours, she soils her crate and we always come back with her whining. 

On the other hand, she sleeps through most of the night. We started taking her out every 2 hours when we got her but now she can sleep for 4-5 hours without needing to potty during the night. Granted she knows someone is in the same room as her at these times. But she‚Äôs never had an accident during the night or whined except for the first night we had her. 

I don‚Äôt think this is a separation anxiety, as I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs still adjusting to everything and wants to be with her ‚Äúpack.‚Äù  Thoughts? 

She gets plenty of attention and exercise during the day. 

What are your guys‚Äô recommendations on how to improve this? I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs a simple as leaving progressively longer starting with just a few minutes then coming back. For kennel/crate training we did the suggested letting her get into it on her own time. She will get in on her own it when prompted with a treat. She‚Äôs on a consistent feeding and potty schedule outside these random times when we need to leave the house for a short time. 

I‚Äôve also wondered if that above solution is the case, if we leave the room for, say 5 minutes, and she whines so we need to wait until she quiets or has an accident or return and just reduce the attempted time we try to leave until she‚Äôs never whining? Most would say not to budge until the whining stops, but I‚Äôve also seen some say having an accident voids that and you should attend to the dog and the accident. 

Thanks for the help! Open to any suggestions and methods. "

While looking for the owner, a family told us the puppy was abandoned by someone who drove away.  We went to 4 different shelters, but no shelter was able to help.  We were told abandoned dogs are common in our area and shelters are overwhelmed.  They did check for a chip, but there wasn't one or a collar.

We ended up taking the puppy home and got the puppy checked out by a vet.  The vet estimated the puppy is around 10-13 weeks old with relatively good health besides being underfed.  We think the puppy is a boxer terrier mix.  We've seen no behavior issues so far.

We're trying to find the owner, but we don't like our chances.  Original owner finding dependent, we'll likely end up keeping our new furry friend.

She was in bad shape but we got her fixed up and she‚Äôs been a great addition to our family. We already had an older dog who is perfect, never barks, perfectly house trained, and just a lovely dog. When we brought the puppy home we started crate training her; she was in the crate during the day while we were at work (we would come home and take her out on lunch) and then she was in the crate at night while we slept. She only ever had two accidents in the crate right at the beginning, but then never again. So clearly she knows how to hold it.

When we first got her we were living in a small studio apartment, and it was making potty training very hard. She would get out of her crate and pee on the floor right away, before we even had a chance to take her out. So we got the idea to use a pierce of turf outside on the porch. And it worked perfectly. She stopped having accidents inside and would go out to use the turf. We still took her outside regularly but the pad was there if she ever needed it in the middle of her outside trips. 

So about a month ago we moved into a new house with a huge yard, we haven‚Äôt got it fenced in yet, but it‚Äôs made walking both the dogs much easier.

660,[RIP]GoodBye Malka,dogs,t3_a8yf1u,5,False,False,a8yf1u,"A furry friend came into my life, many years ago, who changed my life forever. She taught me invaluable lessons and accepted me no matter what. I knew she was genuinely happy to see me every time I came home and I am a better man because of my time with her. She died in my arms last night after a full life and on her own terms, comforted by the ones she trusted, her family.

A little back story. Malka was a lab-mix born a little shy of ten years ago, we think. As she was rescued from an abusive home, we never knew her exact birthday. She was beaten and abandoned when she was only a pup, left without food and water for over a week. She was on death's door when they found her, besides being emaciated, she was ravished by parasites and most of her hair was falling out. We met her 8 weeks later, her health revived, her hair grown in but she was scarred. It was evident. she was the most skittish dog I'd ever seen, scared of everything and everybody. There were 5 other dogs at the foster she was with, and she was always the last one to eat, last one to come in and obviously anti-social. But when I saw her nine years ago I knew. As she peeked her head out of the house, all I could see were her ears, and they were magnificent! They were tall, and she  maneuvered them masterfully, so much that we would learn to gauge her mood from them. When they were fully extended, at full alert, she had the passing resemblance to a bat. I knew this ridiculous creature needed my love. What I didn't know was it was I that needed her love far more.

A couple days later, paperwork completed and adoption approved, she finally came home and what a handful. The representative from the rescue told us she was unadoptable and said ""when"" you bring her back instead of ""if"". Looking back, I think his words gave us an extra resolve to show him wrong, to show him that she was not damaged beyond repair. He was dropping her off at our house with the foster and as Malka saw the only human she'd learned to trust walk out of her life she let out the most heartbreaking howl I had ever heard. It was long and loud, filled with the pain only she knew. We had to keep her leash on constantly for an entire week, even in the house, to keep her calmed. She needed to be in the same room as we were, but didn't want to be too close. I had to carry her down 4 flights of stairs to do her business because she was petrified of the elevator and had no idea how to navigate the steps. She slept at the foot of our bed, but wouldn't get in, she followed us everywhere around the house but always at a safe distance. She was a mess, but she was our mess.

Besides the howl, Malka was uncommonly quiet, no barking or growling or even crying. She didn't vocalize at all for almost a year, until a day I will never forget. She was sitting on a day bed she had commandeered overlooking the parking lot of the apartment complex and we heard something. We didn't know what it was, it was totally unfamiliar and it was coming from the dog. It wasn't quite a bark, but it was something. We hadn't known if she would ever have a voice and here we heard her learning to speak again. We now believe she was beaten for barking and it was at this point that she trusted us enough to know we would never hurt her. Over time her bark became commonplace as she warded off the delivery drivers, let us know when she had to go or sassily talked back. It was about this time that she began sleeping in bed with us, whether we invited her or not. She started out staying down by our feet, but it didn't take long before she started to sneak in between us as we slept. Some of my fondest memories involve her rolling around on her back, squirming and knocking the pillows off with her nose.

After much time, work and love she finally felt safe and her role as protector really started to come out. When we took her to dog parks she always stayed close to us, and would aggressively bar her teeth at any dog she thought got too close to her Mom and Dad. She wouldn't eat until we both got home from work and was always at the door to greet us. If we were sick or upset she was always right there to comfort us and she showed her gratitude every single day. As the days went by the haunted look in her eyes started to subside, but would sometimes come out when she felt threatened. Thunder and vacuums, fishing poles and broom handles along with a myriad of other things were terrifying to her. Taking her out of her comfort zone could be challenging and getting her nails clipped at the groomer could be a herculean feat. She loved vacations but hated getting there and would cry and whine the whole way in transit, but when we arrived she would be so happy to be with us no matter our destination.

Malka, I hope your new destination is filled with open fields to run and squeaky toys to play with. You will never be forgotten.

661,[Fluff] I get to spoil people's animals when they go out of town. Feeling some good feelings at seeing how many animals I'm making bonds with!,dogs,t3_a91cfc,9,False,False,a91cfc,"I work at a pet boarding and veterinary facility. I work on the boarding side, and I can't explain how much I love being able to bond with these dogs!

Most animals that board are scared, unless they're with us regularly. They don't know where their owners are, during busy times of the year it's loud, and a bunch of people they don't know (us) are handling them. It's a great feeling when I see pets return after staying with us for their first time, and even better when they're actually excited!! 

I was looking through our business page at all of the clients being excited to see their animals having a good time, and was just really happy to know that the pictures that were posted weren't staged or fake - the animals were truly having a good time. I was also super happy I was able to help reassure a client that their dog, who is cage aggressive and very unsure of being with us, is already showing signs of being more comfortable and friendly within 24 hours. PLUS, I got to cuddle with a few of my closest doggie pals who are with us for the holidays!

It was a great day, and I just figured I'd share here with a bunch of fellow dog lovers! I hope you all have plenty of animal care providers who love your animals as much as you do. &lt;3 "
662,How did you find your dog sitter? [Help],dogs,t3_a961oq,4,False,False,a961oq,"I've been going nuts trying to find just an average dog sitter with common sense, but I can't seem to find one in my area! Granted, all of the ones I've found have been through Rover, but that's only because I have no idea where else to look. Did you go through nextdoor? Or just have friends/neighbors/family who would help? All I want is someone I can trust to take my dog out to do her business, feed and water her the appropriate amount, and not leave a house full of loose dogs for hours without someone else watching them. My dog is pretty easy going and has no real medical issues so I feel like it shouldn't be this hard but so far every sitter has been lacking in at least one of those areas."
663,[HELP] I just adopted a pyrenees/golden retriever today and have questions and concerns.,dogs,t3_a92c8y,19,False,False,a92c8y,"Hey all. His name is Ghost and hes 1 year and 6 months. at the shelter he was the only dog who wasn't barking, and he seemed very timid. But when we got him out in the training room by himself he opened up a bit and was a pretty sweet dog. His papers say he likes women, but men need to approach cautiously because he spooks. I'm a 6""4 male and he initially cowered away but after kneeling down and letting him approach hes perfectly fine with me. But it makes me think maybe he came from an abusive home before. Here are my concerns I have now:

He knows his name, he perks up when you say it, but he just does not come. Hes house broken, but doesn't appear to know commands. When i try to get him to go outside or get off the bed so we can try and feed him, he just sits there. Gently pulling on his collar or coaxing him doesnt work. Being more firm and pushing him, he hunkers down and resists hard. We practically have to lift him off the bed to get him to come.

He doesnt eat. It's only the first night having him, but I made a bowl of his food that he ate at the shelter and he ignores it. Doesnt respond to treats either. Lady at the groomer tried to give him 3 types of treats and he just sat there looking happy.  I'm chalking this up to stress and nervousness, but am concerned all the same. 

He pants. A LOT. And drools. A LOT. In our cozy front room (he loves our couch) its about 72 degrees. He pants. In our room, we have the fan going and it's closer to about 50-55 degrees. He pants. All the while, slowly dripping drool. 

He strikes me as an old soul. He seems very content and calm. His tail wags when you pet him and he has no problem with you sitting next to him. But he gets timid when hes not laying on the couch or the bed. Hell wander around sometimes and if I pop into the room, he b-lines back to the couch or bed. We try to encourage him and pet him and baby talk him so he knows hes loved but he doesnt seem to respond well. Frankly, I'm worried he might be a little bit slow just because of how calm and retreated he is. Not that that would change how we love him at all. 


We have a German shepherd beagle mix and a German shepherd doberman mix and he acclimated very well to them. No problem sharing the bed with them and no aggression. But he doesnt attempt to play with them, or interact with them at all really. 


So that's the list of concerns I have. This is my first adoption that has been like this. What do I chalk up to ""new environment nervousness"" and what do i need to look deeper into? Also an advice about this breed would be awesome. Hes the biggest, and longest haired dog I've had so it's a bit new "

666,[Help] Should I keep my Beagle in this situation or not?,dogs,t3_a95pm5,5,False,False,a95pm5,"Hello.

Our last dog died 4 days ago(17 years old). She was mixed breed, a small, but very hardy dog. As long as she had food, a bit of affection and a short walk, she was happy. We used to keep her outside, free to roam the yard. Lived most of her life together with her mom, which passed away in 2009. 

The vet which took care of her said that he's got a dog for adoption which might suit us, after the old one died. I expected something like a mixed breed, or a puppy stray dog, but it was an 11 month male Beagle, quite a nice one actually.

So, I've adopted him and having him for 3 days. I took him for walks, played with him, bought him some toys, all the good stuff. 

However, big problem. I'm still living with my parents for a while, and they will not, accept having him indoors. So, whenever I'm not walking him, or playing, he is mostly alone in the backyard, and I can tell he's not really enjoying it, as he is always ''asking'' for attention, or scratching the doors and stuff. I have tried to make them understand that this is not a dog that can be left outside, but they cannot comprehend, for the sake of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:

&amp;#x200B;

Will he get used to this lifestyle? Is this unhealthy for him?  (especially during winter) 

By this I mean being solitary a significant amount of time of the day. He's got a nice cozy shelter, but I feel that is not enough, during winter.

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I just give him away to somebody whom I can trust, and which will accept keeping him indoors, and be most of the time in his company?

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, I'd keep him, because I like him. But in the end, if that's not healthy for him, I will not, and I will give it to somebody I can trust. 

Keep it, or give it away?"

He does like to chew on sticks and dirt when I‚Äôm not looking, so I went with it. He was eating with no issues.

685,[HELP] Got a sick dog chilling at my house and need some advice?,dogs,t3_abidud,29,False,False,abidud," 

So I live on a tropical island and there are plenty of street dogs about. One of the local dogs just ran up to my house and into my living room. He won't eat or drink and is breathing very rapidly. He's also shaking quite badly. He's been like this for about an hour.

I don't know whether he's sick or really freaked out by all the fireworks over the past 24 hours. I've put a fan blowing on him to help cool him down in case he has heat stroke. But any more advice on what I can do? He's ignoring the giant pork bone I put right next to him.

I've tried calling the local rescues but they're not answering, super busy I imagine. He has a collar, but ownership is pretty lose in this part of the world, the dogs just roam around wherever they want.

I'm just chilling with him for now. I don't think taking him to a vet is really an option.

688,[RIP] Why you should consider a seatbelt for your pet,dogs,t3_ab6xsx,246,False,False,ab6xsx,"I would never go anywhere in a car without a seatbelt, but I never even though about one for my dog. I feel so guilty about it, please consider it for your pet(s).

Warning - graphic

I was taking my little girl to a watch a flyball tournament since we were just getting into it. We were going to meet friends, it was going to be a relaxing and easy day. I put her in the back of my car where I keep blankets for her to lay on. We left a few minutes late but it wasnt a big deal if we were late so I wasnt in a rush.

We got on the highway that had construction happening on both sides so there were concrete barriers on the very edges of both outside lanes. A large piece of trash appeared a couple cars ahead of us on the dotted line next to our lane. The car in front of us panicked when they saw it, swerved one direction to miss the trash and then swerved the other direction to miss the concrete barrier. They lost control of the car, skidded and hit a truck a couple lanes over. I remember the sound of the crunch and thinking that sucks. And then, crap, I realized they were going to bounce off the barrier right towards me. I tried to speed up to get away but then I heard the crunch again as they collided into my rear driver side door. 

My car slid and spun. I was facing the traffic I was just traveling with. I remember thinking it would stop there, but then the car rolled. My view was now blocked and the inside of the cabin was dark because my car was on the hood and roof sliding down the road. I was hanging in my seatbelt and there were sparks all around me as concrete met steel. I remember thinking it will all go black soon.

But somehow the car uprighted itself and stopped. It might have hit the concrete barrier I'm not sure. It was over. I spun around and looked for her in the back. The back window was gone. I looked out a small hole of the driver window that wasnt blocked by airbag. A driver went to pass by the accident and I noticed as he slowly rolled by that he looked away from my car. I realized he was probably worried I was dead. I shoved my fingers through so they would know I was alright. He got out of the car and ran up. He asked if I was ok, i said i was fine, but I need to find my dog. Where is she? Several other people ran up, told me not to move, asked if I was ok. One guy even started praying for me, bless his heart. But i was just screaming about my dog and needing to find her. One of them yelled at me that I should just be happy I'm alive and to not worry about the dog. Then someone said they saw my dog run away but she was alive.

I couldn't take it, I scrambled out the passenger door. I started running in the direction they said she went down the rows of stopped cars waiting for the accident to clear. As I ran people yelled out to me 'your dog went that way' and pointed down the row of cars. I ran probably a half mile down this row of cars. The yells from people got less and less. The row of stopped cars had ended and the cars were moving again. And there she was on the dotted line. Her beautiful face was smashed in and her organs were spilling out. The harness and leash she had on had been ripped from her body and was blowing in the wind behind her. 

I will never get rid of that image. 

TL;DR - I got hit in an accident that rolled my car. My dog got thrown from the car and ran down the highway before getting hit. 

I've thought over the accident hundreds of times. There was no other choice I could have made in the moment that would have been better. I was trapped.

I dont know if it would have saved her but a seatbelt harness or special carrier would have at least kept her in the car and kept her from running away. From my research this technology is newer but getting better. They even crash test them. Please consider a seatbelt harness or some means of safety gear for your pet when they are in the car.

Thank you for all of the messages and condolences. Below are some photos of her.

689,[HELP] I had to kick a dog today..,dogs,t3_abkee4,16,False,False,abkee4,"This comes DAYS after I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/aaq7g3/discussion_for_the_love_of_all_things_good_please/) about being tired of off leash dogs.

To make a long story short, I was on my dog's afternoon walk and was going to turn down the corner when I saw an off leash dog, all the way down the block, who noticed us and started slowly walking in our direction. I decided to cross over to the other side of the street, thinking, ""This is totally safe. The dog is all the way down there, owner will notice if it decides to cross."" I was wrong. 

The slow trot turned in to a run. Dog ran down the block and crossed the street, making a beeline towards my dog. I placed myself in front of my girl but the dog was trying to run around me. So I kicked it. I started yelling, ""HELLO? WHOSE DOG IS THIS?!"" over and over. After I gave it a kick the dog stopped advancing on my girl but didn't walk away and had me cornered. Eventually a man responds and just starts calling the dogs name. The dog crossed the street AGAIN. I yelled out some not-so-friendly words to this dog's owner. 

I really need some advice on how to handle these things as I am at my wit's end. I don't want to have to kick an animal but what else am I supposed to do? Someone suggested carrying citronella spray and I'm looking in to it. It's gotten to such a bad and stressful point that we are looking into moving.

700,[Help] Large Breed Puppy Kibble &amp; Supplements Insights and Recommendations.,dogs,t3_abhblo,13,False,False,abhblo,"Hey everyone,

My Rottweiler male puppy who's now 6 months old has had a history with kibbles not working out.
He came from the breeder on Canidae Grain Free puppy but wasn't eating it very well after a month or so of being on it(I bought a bag of the kibble when I ran out of the amount he came home with). Because of his boredom on Canidae, I switched him to Instinct Rawboost Large Breed puppy. He loved it but I got over paying ~$80 for 20 pounds of food. Next was Victor Grain Free Active Dog &amp;amp;amp;amp; Puppy which was great food at a great price. $50 for 30 pounds. But he was not eating nearly enough despite being active with strict feeding schedules and no treats before hand(I've done all the tips and tricks to get a puppy to eat his food).  I also would add freeze dried toppers crushed up or in chunks to keep it interesting and give extra ""umpfh"" to the food. 
So since Victor failed I put him on Royal Canin Breed Specific Rottweiler Puppy food. It took him a while to get used to it since it was his first time in Grain-inclusive kibble. He loved it but I had a terrible feeling about giving him those bad ingredients, but I needed him to gain back his weight he slowed down on while on Victor. 

I read a good bit on how the right kind of grains aren't actually bad for dogs and if your dog isn't allergic to grain, then there shouldn't be a reason for him to eat Grain Free foods. 

How do you all feel about this? 

Personally I think a dog should have Grain in their kibble(it still being no wheat, corn, and soy AND with that being said, if their digestion is alright with it and there's of course not an allergy to it and it's not the first few ingredients)

Currently he has been on Fromm Gold Large Breed Puppy Grain-Inclusive for the last week or so. He seems to like it and has some meals where he's actually licking the bowl clean. 

I give him a little bit of crushed up Stella and Chewy's duck duck goose freeze dried Mixers mixed with his kibble at each meal.
A half scoop of Joint-Max glucosamine granules(500 mg - full scoop being 1000mg) once a day in the PM meal.
A pump of salmon oil per meal.

I am looking at Missing Link Puppy Formula daily supplement as something to add. I at least wanted to introduce digestive enzymes but I need to do some more research on it and the benefits.

My questions are:
1. What Large Breed puppy kibble do you recommend?

2. Is a grain-inclusive kibble just fine for dogs or is Grain Free *really* better for a dog since it's more ""natural and mimics them eating in the wild""?

3. What supplements do you add to kibble to make it better? 

4. Are digestive enzymes a good supplement to add to a dog's kibble? If so, what enzyme brand do you recommend?

5. Do you think a puppy supplement that contains phosphorus and calcium is alright/safe to add to a large breed puppy's kibble? (I contacted the company and they said it's safe for all sizes of puppies including large breeds, but I am still wary but like the idea)


* I also don't want to commit to a raw diet since he will grow to be about 130 pounds, so cost might be an issue. Also, I don't have the freezer space for meal prepping situations. Kibble and supplements for it are my preferred option. 

Apologies for the long post but any help/information/answers are needed and welcomed!
I'm an avid dog food researcher on my down time and also like brands such as Stella and Chewy's. If someone would like to give opinions on that brand too, that would be awesome :)"
701,[Help] Need alternative to flea drops,dogs,t3_abl2ld,2,False,False,abl2ld,"I posted a while ago looking for advice when my 1 year old, 4 lb chihuahua started chasing imaginary bugs across the house. The vet ruled out everything they could, and narrowed it down to either seizure activity or the revolution flea medication I had applied 48 hours prior to the weird behaviour started. We decided on the 'wait and see' method, and after 2 weeks the behaviour started to calm down, 3.5 weeks after the application of the revolution he stopped chasing the bugs completely. So now what?

Over the counter flea drops were completely ineffective, which led me to go to the vet who prescribed the revolution. That was my only option for flea treatment through the vet because my dog is actually only 3.6 lbs and none of the other flea meds were safe for such a small dog. 

Fleas are a huge problem here and its strangely warm for this time of year so we aren't getting the usual winter break from the fleas. My plan so far is to religiously keep the indoor/outdoor cat flea treated so he doesn't bring them in, and treat the house for fleas. But the poor dog had a flea on him today and is stopping to scratch a few times an hour. Does anyone have any suggestions for flea treatment that doesn't contain the insecticides that topical flea drops do? "

But as soon as my wife left for work I went back to the couch to sit with him (again, like I do everyday) and his hair stood up like he was barking at someone outside, and began to growl at me, I could almost see a wild beat in him.

He ran off to hide, I thought something outside might have spooked him, so I followed him with blankets to keep him warm, and a treat to comfort him, but he gave me a small warning bite and has been hiding I think from me ever since.

708,[Discussion] Thinking about getting a dog for the first time,dogs,t3_abkc4f,4,False,False,abkc4f,"Hi, first of all, I am sorry if this post isn't formatted correctly or not in the right place - I know there is a breed questionnaire, but haven't filled that out yet, as my questions are more of a general nature than breed-specific. 

I have had the thought that I would like a dog for quite some time now, but it was never very concrete as my landlord never allowed it; as I'm now in the process of buying my own flat/apartment, it is becoming more concrete again, so I would like to get some advice.

I'm in my early thirties and work from home, which I have heard is a big plus; however, I do have autism (which wasn't diagnosed till recently). I suffer mainly from social anxiety, which might cause me to come across as aloof or not very engaged when speaking to possible breeders or shelter staff; which brings me to my questions! 

First of all, I love the idea of adopting a rescue dog, and it would not be an issue at all for me that the dog likely would not be a puppy anymore; I would also be happy with a senior dog, and would actually prefer adopting to making use of a breeder.

However, this being my first dog plus the fact that I sometimes have a bit of a hard time with being assertive and ""putting my foot down"", I thought that a shelter dog might not be ideal - dogs with behaviour problems would be a no-go till I'm more experienced. 

I do have some breed preferences; labradors / retrievers would always be my first choice, just due to preference as well as ""beginner friendliness"" (correct me if I'm wrong there!). I take it though that it would be very hard to get such a dog as a rescue. Also, as mentioned before, I might have a hard time convincing shelter staff I would be a good ""adoptive dog parent"" due to my social awkwardness.

Would you under these circumstances recommend trying shelters first (possibly telling them about my issues in advance), or would going through a breeder be the better solution?

&amp;#x200B;

I've had my dog since I was 6 years old and he has pretty much been my best friend ever since. He's not what someone would describe as a the most ""tame"" dog: he's loud as all hell, anti-social and hostile around other dogs, and a little disobedient and aggressive with his owners, to the point that he scratched and bit my mother and I a number of times throughout his life. That's just the kind of dog he is and yet, I've always loved him with all my heart. He was always my best bud and acted like any other loving dog would: he would come to me whenever I called out to him (heck, I didn't have to say anything, just extending my hand was enough for him to come), he liked it when I pet him and rubbed his tummy, he'd get excited whenever I chased him around the house and the garden, he had fun when we played with his toys, he'd go crazy whenever I had to leave the house and, as soon as I came back, he wouldn't stop jumping and showering me with kisses; heck, he would pretty much do that every morning when I woke up. But everything changed two weeks ago, when I came back home for the holidays. At first everything seemed normal: as soon as he saw me he got all excited and started jumping and kissing me as usual, but the next day he seemed like a completely different dog. Now it seems like he doesn't even want to be around me anymore: he completely ignores me, when I call him he acts like I don't exist, he never comes near me out of his own volition, when I show him his toys and incite him to play with me he looks confused and, worst of all, every time I pet him he starts growling at me. Now I'm afraid of even lifting him up for fear that he might bite me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to fear that he might not recognise me anymore. My mum says that might be it. She says that it's because he's old (15 yo) and that now that I spend 8 months a year away from home to go to college he might have trouble remembering me. Plus he's deaf now, so not hearing my voice might be a big factor in all this.

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't get is why this is happening now. He seemed to recognise me just fine the first day I came back; in fact, I've been going to college for 4 years now and every time I came back nothing seemed to be wrong with him. I also don't see why the fact that he's deaf matters when he was already deaf back when I came home for summer break this year and during that time everything was still fine. And most importantly, he still loves my mum to death like he always has and is still playful and cheerful around her. On that note, He might be old but he's still really healthy; the vet says he might live 3 to 5 more years. So I'm just left here wondering what the fuck is up with him. Does he really not know who I am because he's old? Or does he dislike me for god knows what other reason?

&amp;#x200B;

Either way I'm completely devastated. I've always heard stories of dogs not recognising their owners as they got older, and I've been mentally and emotionally preparing myself for years in case that ever happened to me, but it turns out I wasn't ready after all: I haven't cried in 5 years, but today I broke down just thinking about my dog hating me. Anyone know what might be going on here, or got any suggestions?

Had a nice thick one that was easy to handle and lost it unexpectedly. Used a poorly constructed one today and ended up losing control of my pup and face-planted on the concrete (she has some leash reactivity we have been working on).  While she realized I was no longer attached to the leash and waited for me to come around the curve, I‚Äôd like to prevent this in the future. 

Thanks in advance!"
715,[Help] dog anorexia,dogs,t3_abevu3,29,False,False,abevu3,"Our akita dog has officially been diagnosed with anorexia. 

This is one of those dogs who can and has preferred to starve itself to death rather than eat. We have gone through over 20 different kinds of food and even raw dog food with appetite stimulant, fish, cheese, egg, diary, food toppers, etc. We always give big praise when she finishes her meal and we try to reward her with a treat like an egg to get a little more food in her. 

Question 1 : We have found a few things that sometimes work but sometimes there are 1-4 days at a time where she will not eat. How do we manage these days? Currently we try to force at least half a meal in her at meal times. We also try to change up the next meal by using a different fish or the other flavor of kibble, less of this, more of that, etc and sometimes she will eat the first half of her meal on her own but beyond that little success. Occasionally we take her meal back and put an egg or yogurt or cheese in it but she still doesn't want it. We read from another akita owner that akitas need a fasting day but in our experience that's just one less day that she eats.  We have tried to feed her a third meal but she just eats that much less for dinner. 


Question 2 : I am very frightened because when I research management of the long term, there is really  nothing out there to read. I've only found one research paper and it was absurdly simple-minded and had nothing new. Even appetite stimulants are only recommended short term. Are there any resources for long-term management?

Question 3 : Why does she shut down and what can we do to stop it? She is moderately interested and starts to eat it but then her ears go way back on her head, she gives the whale eye, and she makes herself small and avoidant, trying to slink away out of sight. Maybe 5 minutes later she burps. But about 60-70% of the time after that initial stopping she is not eating again. 

Background: She was rescued from her first home and we believe she developed much of her disorder there. In her second home, her and another dog ate from the same bowl ( so the dog ate very, very little) and the owner resorted to feeding her whatever she was eating for dinner, but even still the dog was under 50% what it should weigh. 

Current diet: We found a brand of healthy kibble that she likes pretty well, and a different flavor of it. She will just never be a kibble-only dog. Currently her diet is: 1 boiled fish fillet, oatmeal and rice and barley, kibble, fish oil, 1 egg, all mixed together so she can't just eat the fish and walk away. We make sure that the fish and oats mix is warm but not too hot and that the fish oil is distributed so she won't get a yucky mouthful of it and we try to make sure that the kibble is not soggy. 

I maintain my happy and calm face and remove distractions and such. But we are so tired. We spend more and more time fixing her foods and our rituals feel absurd. 

The only thing that I have ever seen her eat like a normal dog was a rare steak for a special occasion. "

My girlfriend didn't notice right at first, but when they went inside, she saw blood  on the floor that she traced back to the nail!

Pic of nail: [https://imgur.com/1CcKRdd](https://imgur.com/1CcKRdd)  
She was overly worried so I brought  him to the vet the next day. The vet took a look and thought that it  should be clipped up just below the quick, and more than likely the nail  would grow out and be fine. They clipped that nail and a few others  that were long-ish, and afterwards we were hit with the following:

71$ exam &amp; consult

13.50$ nail trim

39.13  Rimadyl (100mg chews x 7) (He really probably didn't need these, but he  did have a slight limp that the vet thought he noticed)

A 123$ bill. Just for a 20-25 minute appointment and a few nails clipped!

Am  I over-reacting, or should we look for another vet? We live in southern NH and I like everybody there, but it feels excessive. We're looking for pet insurance at the moment and would rather get it all done in one swoop if we do decide to switch. I'm at the point where I'm worried to take him in for issues we're unsure about, if we're going to be charged  \~75-100$ a pop.

I've been working at my county's humane society for about 7 months now. A week and a half ago, an owner surrendered a 1.5yo intact male Boerboel. They had raised him from 8 weeks and surrendered him because he had begun to growl at the kids. When your dog is a 140lb Mastiff, you dont take that lightly. The dog was a prime example of his breed, loyal and strong, and just a bit goofy. I fell in love with him immediately. I know that attachment is not the best in my line of work, but it was love at first sight. 

Over the last week, I found that he was a smart boy - caught on to the shelter routine in one day, listened when I told him not to mess with the gate, even head great leash manners. His previous owners had clearly put a lot of effort into his training. At the same time, we discovered that he wasn't growling because he didn't like kids. He chased shadows that werent really there. He spooked at leaves falling and at birds flying away. He was suspicious of anyone that wasnt me. There was clearly someyhing neurological going on, and it was getting worse.

Anyway, we put him to sleep yesterday. I was basically the only person he trusted, so I gave him the sedatives and stayed until they kicked in. I held his massive head as he went. It was peaceful - minimal stress and lots of yummy wet food. I cried a lot last night. He would have been my ideal dog. I loved him, but we couldn't fix him.

While we were walking back, there was a long stretch or road that had pretty much zero lighting and there were to homeless guys coming out from a nearby alleyway. They started with following from a distance on the other side of the road, but after a bit they crossed and started quickening their pace towards me. I guess Barrett picked up on that because as we were walking he turned to stare at them more and more frequently. When the guys were about 10ish feet behind me at Barrett stopped and refused to move no matter how much a pulled on the leash (he has a pinch collar so I knew he was serious). He kept starring and growling at the guys until they got visibly nervous and turned a corner. There have been a lot of robberies around town over the past few weeks so I felt a lot safer with my pup. He isn‚Äôt normally growly or aggressive towards others outside the house so this was a huge switch in his normal behavior. I knew he had my back in the situation though since I was (kind of obviously) very stressed and nervous that they were coming up behind so fast. Every few steps he‚Äôd just turn around and watch them until they were so close that would just refuse to budge. Such a good boy!"

His owners would let him out to do his business in the morning, once more in the evening, and then would frequently let him spend the night out of the crate but locked in their room. He is mine now, and I'm not exaggerating when I say he is one of the best things in my life. I love him more than I can express, and I just want his remaining years to be filled with joy.
My job situation changed and now I am gone from the apartment 10 hours a day, five days a week, which means he spends that time in his crate. He is terrified to be left alone and not locked in the crate. I've tried slowly getting his accustomed to being alone and non-crated, somewhere around the 15 minute mark he goes crazy. It isn't fair for him to force it, but I don't like keeping him locked up all the time.
I haven't worked out since I got him, because I would have to put him in the crate for at least an extra hour, and that isn't good for me. I'm struggling, even with a long walk each morning with him. Does anyone have any suggestions? I've considered getting an 'exercise pen' to somehow attach to his crate, but he likes to have the roof over his head (we are still working on playing in the grass, lol), so I think an open one would freak him out, even inside."

So I have a husky/golden retriever mix who is going on 3 years old next month. He has recently in the past 5 months developed a nasty habit of pooping in the house. (Which he hasn‚Äôt done since about 1 or so year old) 

But the thing is...he only does this when my girlfriend is home alone with him. 

I work night shift and she is usually staying over at my house 3-4 nights a week to hang out and take care of the dogs. She walks my husky at least 30-45 mins before bed (same route and timespan I give him) She says as soon as she shuts the door to my room and lays down she can smell that he pooped inside. 

When she‚Äôs gone and the dogs stay in overnight, I come and check on them in the morning and no poop. And whenever she‚Äôs gone for a week or so at a time we have absolutely no incidents. 

Now, I let my dogs sleep with me in the bed when she‚Äôs gone, but when she‚Äôs in town they get the dog beds in the living room because she gets too hot cuddling them. 

Is he lashing out at her, kinda like a ‚Äúf you‚Äù for not letting him in the bed with her? He absolutely adores my girlfriend and wants to constantly cuddle her. 

They are on a good feeding schedule and pretty much know when it‚Äôs time to be let out to potty.

727,[Help] My baby is acting weird and I‚Äôm terrified,dogs,t3_abedow,4,False,False,abedow,"We have a 7 year old German Shepard mix that I adopted about two years ago. She is the love of my life, she is lazy but also loves to play, she loves everything and everyone.

Usually my girl loves being around us, she always wants to be in the room and as physically close as possible, if for some reason she‚Äôs separated from us (closed door or gate) she paces until we let her join us. I don‚Äôt mind this behavior because she‚Äôs lovely and the only reason she sometimes get separated is bc we lock both the dogs up together. 

But today was different. This morning I woke up and took both dogs out, and old girl was very hesitant to get off the porch to potty(it‚Äôs a bit of a jump but she‚Äôs never had trouble with it). I eventually had to lift her down, once she was down she was fine and used the bathroom normally. When we came back inside she went straight to the back room and got in her bed, this is very unusual for her, she usually will sit out in the living room or come into the bedroom and hang out. She proceeded to do this all day. She stayed in her bed in the back room, didn‚Äôt really get up for much other than a few bathroom breaks and when my sister came over. I finally dragged her bed into my room tonight so that she‚Äôs close to me so I can monitor her overnight. 

I‚Äôm worried that maybe she got hurt playing with the puppy? Or maybe she‚Äôs sick? She‚Äôs not really displaying any other symptoms, she‚Äôs used the bathroom normally, she‚Äôs eaten and had water. We are having issues with puppy training, we‚Äôre being very strict with the puppy and crating her until she‚Äôs house broke, so maybe that‚Äôs just making her nervous?

732,"[Discussion] A bunch of out of control dogs at the vet with retractable leashes, old girl did good.",dogs,t3_ab97l4,23,False,False,ab97l4,"TL;DR - Mostly just a vent, but open for commenting. Our old dog did great at the vet while getting lunged at and bothered. It was to see how steady she was in the presence of very uncontrolled dogs. We have another dog who is a big, lunging, territorial boy but we're putting in the training and effort to have control in tough situations. Dog tax at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Our old dog is \~11, has bad spinal arthritis and gets laser therapy 2x a month. She's a steady dog but is 50/50 on meeting new dogs. She's a mutt with a lot of herding breeds and so her version of playing is either chasing or pinning dogs. For the most part in public we keep her close by, block any dogs from greeting, let their owners know we don't want to play, and it's much less stressful for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was a busy day at the vet. The moment we walk through the door there was a dog on a retractable leash lunging at my dog. The owner was desperately, unsuccessfully, trying to hold this 80+ pound dog back. She told me, ""he is friendly, he's just really excited"" and gives up trying to hold him back. Not okay! It's not my fault you have zero control of your dog. I ended up backing my girl into a corner to block their dog off and told her that my dog isn't great with greeting dogs on a leash. She and her teenager try to wrangle him back, and continue to do this for the 5 minutes they have to wait, while other dogs go in and out of the waiting room. The lady's daughter even stayed over by me and petted my dog until they had to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

In the time we were waiting, a 2-3 month old Golden came in and excited the crazy dog. This puppy was better behaved. Then someone came to pick up 2 huskies from boarding - you know how dogs are when they see their owner - so crazy dog got even crazier. A vet tech even came out to help them get it under control. All they ended up doing was dragging him into an exam room.

&amp;#x200B;

While my dog was in her laser session, another owner comes in with a big dog on a retractable leash and lets it wander all over the waiting room. I don't understand why people do this? We're all in a cramped space, there are dogs of all sorts coming and going, and people think that because their own dog is friendly everyone else's will be fine. This blows my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

My girl weathered the whole thing. She stayed in contact with my legs, watched all the excitement, patiently let the excitable dogs sniff her when they got out of their owner's control, and only growled when one got too personal. She let the crazy dog's little girl pet her for the extent of their wait and even licked her on the nose. I could not be prouder of her.

&amp;#x200B;

I get the crazy dog thing, though, I really do, but that's why it's so important to understand the commitment of a dog. They need training, they need practice, and they need patience. I think a lot of people get dogs and believe that they will learn everything easily, but sometimes (a lot of times?) it takes more. Our second dog is a 90 pound Great Pyrenees / cattle dog. He is a piece of work. He's big, pushy, territorial, and reactive. We are working on it. We hired a trainer and committed to the time and practice he needs. He's not perfect, but I know that we have structure for the difficult situations. We can go to the vet and he will stay by my side instead of lunging at dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm frustrated. It was such a stressful event to go to the vet today, but I also understand how this happens. Mostly I just wish people understood the correct use of retractable leashes (which is almost none) and that dogs take training and commitment.

After new years eve, just in the morning of 1st of january, I went out to say goodbye to my friends that were leaving etc. 

Suddently I see a nice beautiful dog, a bit thin, but very educated. She seemed very confused, a stranger just yelled at her because she was in the way of his parked car. 

When I called her, she instantly came to me. Like she trusted me for years. And She was so soft and very lovable. She was mature, it could be seen she had some babies but the breasts were long and ‚Äòold‚Äô, they were not fresh. So she might have been a bit old. I‚Äôm not sure. However I‚Äôve never seen such an educated dog. It was clear she was either lost or thrown away. I hope she was just lost. She seemed to look for ‚Äòher human‚Äô. 

I went to some houses nearby asking people if they have seen or know who this dog is. Nobody could help. AND SHE CAME WITH ME, patiently waiting every time when I talked to people, she always sit in the ‚Äòsit position‚Äô and acted so damn educated. I‚Äôm fucking crying typing this. 

I went and bought her dog food. She didn‚Äôt eat. She followed me everywhere. In the end I got back to the house and my friend said she followed her up until the bus station. 

Seriously. I am a piece of shit! I thought of taking her. I really wanted a dog and I feel it was a sign in my opinion. However I do have health issues that make me be already helped by other people. There is no way I could take care of her without ‚Äòextra help‚Äô. And people didn‚Äôt want her.

I guess I can take some small comfort in knowing she‚Äôll probably never have a dog and therefore won‚Äôt have the opportunity to harm one with it. I just wish I wasn‚Äôt stuck in a cabin with her for so many days. 

I need help coming up with a response for the next time she inevitably tries to give me advice about how to take care of my own dog, like the time she told me never to comfort a dog when they‚Äôre scared because that just encourages them to be scared in the future. "
736,[News] [Research] Discrimination of Food Amounts by the Domestic Dog (Canis familiaris),dogs,t3_ab9658,0,False,False,ab9658,"**Full Text:** [Here.](https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt26m2v6x2/qt26m2v6x2.pdf?t=pg52eu&amp;nosplash=06aff83172e67d3176fbeccfe4c4afe4)

**Abstract:** 

&gt; The current research examined dog's ability to dsicriminate between different amounts of food. Using a two alternative forced choice procedure dogs werre required to discriminate between a constant amount of 4 pieces of food and another amount that varied across a range from 1 to 7 pieces. The dogs reliably selected the larger of two alternatives. Discrimination was better when there were fewer rather than more than 4 pieces of food available on the varying alternative. Specifically, 1 was discriminated from 4 more easily than 4 was discriminated from 7 pieces of food. These results confirmed the ability of dogs to discriminate food amount on a psychophyical choice procedure.

737,"Dog has hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, worried about treatment plan [HELP]",dogs,t3_abcf4r,3,False,False,abcf4r,"My four year old shepherd mix has had loose stool for a few days and started throwing up this morning. I got a call from my mom while at work and he had started pooping blood, then a few minutes later he was vomiting blood. We got him to the vet within three hours of the blood and he's been diagnosed with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. 

He was given a subcutaneous fluid injection and sent home with antibiotics and anti nausea/diarrhea meds. I was told to take him to the emergency vet if he doesn't start eating and drinking. He drank some water when we got home (he was so thirsty he was trying to drink from the hose) but he threw everything up immediately. My vet closed early for new years and I don't have an emergency number at the moment. I read some scary posts about HGE and now I'm wondering if I should just take him tonight to get an IV to be safe."

739,[FLUFF] My girl won over a woman who was terrified of dogs!,dogs,t3_ab3296,13,False,False,ab3296,"Today while we were walking, my dog locked eyes with this woman and proceeded to cry and butt wiggle for pets and love. She's usually a bit shy, but sometimes she'll choose a person she  absolutely must say hi to.

The woman laughed and slowly approached, which my dog did a ""woo woo!"" for. This poor woman got so scared that she dropped everything she was holding. When she bent down to pick her stuff up, my girl  respected her space but still booty wiggled, tap danced, and cried for attention. The woman slowly reached a hand up to pet her and that was it. She explained she's deathly scared of doggies because of a past experience.

Long story short, the lady walked away, thanking us for letting her spend time with my dog (five minutes in the middle of the street. my dog was so happy)  and saying, ""I think I'm going to get one of you, soon!"" to my girl. Made me so proud.

740,[HELP] Normal Dominance in Dogs?,dogs,t3_abfgxa,1,False,False,abfgxa,"Before Christmas, our oldest girl passed away. She was our first dog and we always maintained she was the alpha among the other dogs. Three months after adopting Old Girl, we brought a 5 week old pit mix into our family. The two of them were best friends. On the off chance they escaped our yard, Pittie would nudge Old Girl home and keep her warm in colder months (Old Girl was a 15 pound mix).

In July, we brought home a 2 month old Lab mix. She quickly learned her place in the hierarchy and all went on their merry way. 

Fast forward to the day after Christmas. We found ourselves at local shelters, agreeing that we would only bring home a dog if we thought they would fit with Pittie and Lab. We found a beautiful, sweet one year old Border Collie mix that we fell in love with. All signs pointed to her and she was amazing with our kids.

We did slow introductions, introducing Lab first. We then introduced Pittie and Border off property and took them for a walk. They did great and we took them home to the back yard, letting them run together. All three did wonderful!

Our son came outside and immediately Pittie had Border cornered and wouldn‚Äôt let her near our son. This happened once and we have monitored all activities with our kids and the dogs present since. Pittie has never shown any dominance traits. She responds to my commands above anyone else, going as far as having a live prey animal in her mouth and dropping on command leaving the animal unharmed.

The three still play well outside, however, once inside, Pittie can just walk by Border and Border is laid out under her, surrendering.

I‚Äôve never seen this behavior in Pittie and have never seen this behavior in general, as Old Girl was much smaller than the other two and would only bark or growl.

Is this something we should be watching closely? Is there anything extra we should be doing to deter this? As of now, we do what the vet at the shelter told us to do, which is show Pittie attention first and reward her for good behavior before rewarding Border. 

There are no issues between Pittie and Lab. And there are no issues between Border and Lab."

This is my father's best friend, closest companion, and he blames himself for not taking her to the doc sooner. He was just getting ready to go to the vet, when he found her already passed.

We told him she probably passed in her sleep, but there's a pool of blood around her nose. 

She has been sick for some time (Chronic pancreatitis).  Mom warned that we'll need to put her down before the end of the year. Mom knew and tried her hardest to help him prepare. 

But the look on his face is so heartbreaking. He just lost both of his parents 3 years ago and within a month of each other. I knew this was going to be a difficult loss for the family.

Tomorrow is Dad's birthday. I feel lost on what to do to help him. I've never seen him this upset. My family has not dealt with the loss of a pet since the early 80s. I'm not sure what I can do to help my father. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. (We also have a small rescue, I think she knows but did not see the passing/body. What should I do for her?)

745,[Breeds] Low energy + medium size dog breed?,dogs,t3_abd855,18,False,False,abd855," \*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* No. I have a dog currently that I trained from a puppy. I also have helped train a family dog from 8 weeks old.  

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* I don't really have a preference. I've always gone through reputable breeders so I'm more comfortable with that process but if I can find the right dog for me I'm open to rescuing  

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* easy to train, lovable/cuddly, chill, doesn't mind being home alone for most of the day  

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* I haven't narrowed it down. I'm looking for lower energy dogs but it seems like that is mostly giant breeds or small dogs. I've wanted a great dane but I'm not sure I can deal with the drool and having to go through their short lifespans. My current dog is small (20lb F Puggle) so bringing a young giant breed into the family would probably upset her immensely. I've always had labs so I'm not a big fan of small dogs even though I have one now. I'm open to considering a Pug or another Puggle but the short nose breeds and their health problems kind of freak me out.    

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* basic obedience such as sit stay come shake

  \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* 1-2 hours. I work evenings and I'm gone for about 10.5 hours during the day when I work.   

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* Probably a half hour or less. Usually inside play. I do like taking my current dog to the dog park but we don't get out much lately. If the new dog I get is a puppy or very young I would hire a dog walker or a friend to give them a walk while I'm at work.  8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* Brushing once a week or more is fine. I can also do everything other than trimming hair. My current dog hates having her nails done because her quicks are abnormally wide so clippers hurt her more than I'm used to with other dogs I've trimmed.  

 \*\*Personal Preferences\*\* 

 9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Medium to Large. I'm pretty much open to everything other than tiny or yippy dogs. 

 10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* Not so much slobber and barking. Shedding is part of being a pet owner  

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* meh. I can't do that with my dog without an e-collar (I only beep) so if I can't do it with my next dog either its not a deal breaker.   

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* snuggly or little bit of both. I don't want them to be so needy that they have separation anxiety when I leave for work.  

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?  \* Again, middle is best if not eager-to-please  

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I would prefer my current dog not bark and freak the heck out but not much I can do about that now. I'd like it to be friendly and not scare people away.  

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* Absolutely not.   

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?  \* Food/toy aggression, prey instinct towards my current small dog  

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* 5 days a week/10.5 hours a day  

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* Live alone  

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* Puggle (pug/beagle)  

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* Semi-regularly (friends kids and nieces/nephews but no kids of my own)  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I own 

 22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* I don't believe there are any breed specific laws in my location  

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* I live in Wisconsin. Some winters the wind chill has gotten to -35F. I'm aware some dogs may not tolerate that. I also keep the AC pretty cold in the summer so a cold weather dog would be okay.  

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* I'm having trouble finding a medium sized dog that is pretty low energy. I know it often depends on the dog (my family has a crazy lazy lab because it has adapted to their lazy lifestyle) and how it adapts to my lifestyle, but I don't want to make a dog suffer or act out because its brimming with untapped energy. I often have my family dog (80lb F Lab) and brother's dog (15 week old M lab puppy) around my dog and will need my future dog to be good with both small and large dogs for that reason.  I've done several breed selector quizzes and they come up with many of the giant breeds with short lifespans and big slobbers. Even though I think it would be fun to have a giant dog I'm not sure its the best idea.

757,"[Breeds] Looking for a friendly pup, what breeds will be right for me?",dogs,t3_abavy7,5,False,False,abavy7,"**\*\*Introduction\*\***

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* It will be my first dog as a primary owner. I had a Lab growing up. I did not participate in the training.

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

* I do not. If I can rescue a young mix of the breed that will work best for me, I will do that. If one does not need adopting, I will seek a breeder. I prefer a younger dog to ensure proper training.

3. Describe your ideal dog.

* Friendly, eager to please, intelligent, sturdy, medium-sized,

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I was looking seriously into the Swedish Valhund, but after doing some research they are sadly too active for our lifestyle. The robustness, friendliness, and intelligence made them extremely attractive to me.\* Eurasiers - seem to be easygoing, quiet, and friendly. I've read that they match your activity level, which would be nice for us since summers will be more active than winters. They seem trainable but with somewhat of a sassy personality.
* Finnish Lapphund, Braque du Bourbonnais, and Broholmer all looked great on the AKC website, but further research shows them to be kind of rare? Are there any similar breeds you can recommend?

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I would like the dog to be able to join me to social events. Trusting him/her with basic commands like sit/stay/come is required. I do not intend to do any herding/sniffing tasks with this dog. A few parlor tricks may be trained but nothing terribly out of the ordinary for a companion dog.

**\*\*Care Commitments\*\***

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 1-2 hours

7. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* I intend to do a short \~30 minute walk in the mornings, and then about an hour walk after work during the weekdays. On weekends I would like to take the dog on short hikes with my friend's dog - hopefully off-leash to encourage activity but it depends on the personality (hikes would be about an hour or two, most likely). We have a dog park nearby that I will take the dog to for socialization a few times a week.
* In the winter it gets extremely rainy and cold, so there will likely be less exercise on these days. We will probably go down to 1 walk, for roughly a half hour. If anyone has tips on how to exercise your dog when it's pouring I am open to ideas!

8. How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Regular brushing I am okay with. Ears and nail clipping is fine. I am not interested in trimming hair.

**\*\*Personal Preferences\*\***

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* \*Medium. Smaller than a Lab. Sturdy/robust enough to wrestle with the boys or go on camping trips ideally.

10. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I don't mind. Barking and slobber are not acceptable. Chattering/mumbling is okay, but if it comes with actual barking/howling that will be a problem.

11. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I'd love to be able to let the dog off-leash on trails and campgrounds, but this is not an everyday occurrence so not a high priority requirement.

**\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\***

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in-between. I want an affectionate dog that does not need constant attention.

13. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please

14. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* No barking or jumping. A healthy curiosity is fine but I don't want anyone to be scared away before the door even opens. I can't manage an aggressive dog.

15. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

16. Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* The dog needs to be okay around children and small pets.
* I do not appreciate licking.

**\*\*Lifestyle\*\***

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* My husband and I both work during the day and will be out from 7-4ish. Besides that the dog will rarely be left alone. Even then, I have 2 adult indoor-only cats who are very playful so the dog will not be totally isolated.

18. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Only other preference is no small or skittish dogs. My husband and I will share equal roles in training and caring for the dog.

19. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have 2 indoor-only, average sized cats. I do not plan on adding any other animals once we adopt the dog.

20. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. We have a few friends with children and are considering having one of our own.

21. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I own my house. It has front/back yards with moderate space to run around.

22. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live near Seattle, WA. There is apparently a pit bull ban/restriction, but I only know that because I looked it up just now. It is not enforced as far as I can tell. There are quite a few pit bulls &amp; pit bull mixes in our area.

23. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer: 70s. Very sunny, warm, often breezy.
* Winter: 40s. Icy, rainy, sometimes snow.

**\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\***

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I have a fenced in front and back yard, both with grass that the dog can play in. There are a lot of dog-friendly parks and businesses nearby so socialization won't be an issue.
* I go to most of the comic/video game conventions in the area. Depending on the dog's personality I would like to bring them along (outside only, of course). The dog would need be able to be around large groups of strangers without becoming skittish or aggressive.

758,Just got a rescue dog advice and tips [help] [pitbull],dogs,t3_abc0jy,6,False,False,abc0jy,"For the record my household consists of my dad and mom ,my younger brother (22) his gf has her own place as well but visits alot. My gf (24) and me (24). 

Okay so I have a few questions for anybody regarding Rescue dogs. 

Now it wasnt from a shelter or anything. My older brother said that his first owners didnt treat the dog well in that he was always in a cage and didnt  really eat (he used to be super skinny.)  Might have been abused. 

My older brothers friend took him from that home for alittle bit  but he couldn't keep him because he was moving away.

So my older brother had him for 3 weeks and he couldn't keep him because of his cat (couldnt get along after 5 days and he didnt is probably scared of dogs. My older brother also has a female and Male pitbull that are older but they all eventually got along (not sure about the Male one ) 

 My older brother said he might be afraid other dogs because he hasn't been around then most of his life.

Hes such a happy loving dog and I think we are going to keep him but we are going to wait and see how he adjusts to our his new environment and it's up to my mom and dad.  He also yelped and was scared of my younger bro this morning after my bro put on colenge 


We had  previous pitbull that lived until 9 (passed away from cancer) he was a pitbull mix with an eighth of rotwielr and he was the nicest dog ever. But again he didnt get along with other dogs because he got attacked by two when he was a puppy.


TLDR : We recently took in  rescue dog and was wondering tips about training him to not constantly pull us when walking him and hes also scared of the wooden kitchen floor because he slipped twice. Healso might have been abused when he was growing up but now he has a loving home. Haven't had a dog since 2013.

I will post a pic of him later when I get the chance "

She is diabetic, but refuses to take her insulin shots. As she is a lab-mix, she's obviously too big for me to forcibly hold down. She drinks a lot and urinates a lot. She is unable to control her bladder really. It appears she might be going blind. I do not want to put her down because she is still happy and very loving and, on her good days, extremely active. She is curious and attentive and caring. I don't want to put her down simply because having to clean up her urine is an inconvenience. She is still a member of the family. Please advise! Thank you."

763,[Breeds] What breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_abdpqr,1,False,False,abdpqr,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I had a Rat Terrier growing up, and I have an adopted Chihuahua-Dachshund mix now. I‚Äôve grown up around dogs, and I was always a dog nerd as a kid.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Definitely prefer going to a rescue, but MAYBE open to a breeder if the right breed/mix isn‚Äôt in a shelter, though likely not.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I‚Äôd love a dog to cuddle with, my Chiweenie is super stubborn (Which I love), but I‚Äôd like a dog that‚Äôs more obedient. Kind and friendly, playful is a must. Preferably loves fetch, but that‚Äôs just a great side effect.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I love border collies, because of their sheer intelligence and I could take it hiking and maybe search and rescue or agility or something. I‚Äôd like something more medium-sized, I already have a Chiweenie, and while I love my small dogs, I‚Äôd like a medium sized dog (I‚Äôm a small person so for me to control it physically while training, I‚Äôd say between 25-45 pounds).

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I‚Äôm highly interested in training search and rescue or maybe agility, or just some awesome dog tricks.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Honestly my life revolves around my one dog already, as he even goes to the office with me on most days, so I can spend a lot of time with it. Must be a good traveler though.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* My current dog and I make frequent trips to the dog park, and he comes with my to the office most of the time, where I give him several short walks when I‚Äôm feeling tired of phone calls. Other days, he goes with me door to door canvassing neighborhoods. I‚Äôd love to train some agility, and definitely into search and rescue. At least one good walk a day is guaranteed though.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I‚Äôve always had short haired dogs, so I‚Äôve done most grooming on my own. However, my parents had a Flat-Coated Retriever who got professionally trimmed once or twice a year, and I‚Äôd be ok with paying for that. Brushing I can do, and ear cleaning is not a problem.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Preferably a medium-sized dog. I‚Äôm a small person and am currently by myself, so for me to control it physically (not get dragged around during training), I‚Äôd prefer a 25-45 pound dog. I have had small dogs in the past, but I‚Äôve always thought the small dog- bigger dog combo was cute.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* My Chiweenie is pretty mouthy, so I‚Äôm used to barking. Shedding, well that‚Äôs what vacuums and lint rollers are for. Slobber isn‚Äôt my favorite thing, but if it‚Äôs the right dog, then I wouldn‚Äôt mind that much.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*  My current dog is always on a leash, except at the dog park (which is fenced), and I always stay close, so not a huge issue.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I love snuggling with my Chiweenie, so definitely snuggly.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* I‚Äôd LIKE a dog that‚Äôs more obedient and open to training, but my current dog is really stubborn and I love that about him, in a sense. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking is ok, preferably not really *aggressive*, as I do take my dog(s) a lot of places. Doesn‚Äôt have to be that dog that falls apart at a stranger‚Äôs attention but definitely not aggressive.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, as I do have another dog so that obviously wouldn‚Äôt be a good decision.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* As long as it‚Äôs not too severe and can be fixed/trained out, I‚Äôm fine. Aggression would be a really bad thing considering being in public with people. Fear wouldn‚Äôt be too bad, as I could work with that. Basically anything able to be trained out and where I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about biting would be fine.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not often. I take my current dog most places, so I don‚Äôt see a problem adding another one to a trip.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I currently live alone, and I have a rule that if they don‚Äôt like my dogs, they can leave.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*I do have a Chihuahua-Dachshund mix, he‚Äôs currently a year old but I‚Äôm not looking to adopt a dog within the next couple of years (doing this out of curiosity when the time comes, because I‚Äôd like to do a ton of research before I get it). I‚Äôd potentially love to have other pets like a rat, a ferret, etc.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No, I‚Äôm 19 and don‚Äôt have kids, don‚Äôt want them, and it‚Äôd be rare to come across a young kid in my office (it‚Äôs a political office).

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I will rent, but I‚Äôm used to working with having my dog and having the place that will allow my dogs (I travel for work, so housing changes).

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Not that I know, and the dogs on the top ten list for ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù dogs are too big for me. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* We travel a lot, so preferably able to handle hotter temperatures (no bulldogs, etc). But for winter, I do have coats and sweaters and I prefer warmer temperatures indoors so we can be warm together.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Not much, just must be a good traveler. Long drives are no fun with a nervous/car sick dog (though I did teach my Chiweenie to like car rides).

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  "
764,[Help] Great Pyrenees feeding/diet help?,dogs,t3_ab8s6f,13,False,False,ab8s6f,"Hi all, new subscriber here. I was hoping maybe someone would have some advice for me on this subreddit. 

In May of this year we adopted a Pyrenees mix puppy from a rescue. She‚Äôs about 11 months old now. She has never been super interested in food but we‚Äôve always been able to find ways to entice her to eat (adding a bit of pumpkin, carrots/peas, or peanut butter to her kibble); however, as of late she‚Äôs just not interested. When she does eat, it‚Äôs not as much as she should be eating based on what we know about her weight/breed. In the first few months, she was gaining about 7-8 pounds per month, but now she‚Äôs barely gained 10 since August. 
:( We‚Äôve just swapped out her kibble for a protein based food as opposed to the grain based kibble she was eating (both from a high quality, large breed brand). We‚Äôve had our vet do blood work to make sure there‚Äôs not something internally causing this issue (we initially had concerns about Addison‚Äôs) and everything came back just fine. He said as long as she continues to gain some weight then there‚Äôs no need to be worried, but I can‚Äôt help it! All of her siblings are now a solid 25+ pounds heavier than she is (although we are fairly certain that she is the runt of the litter and she‚Äôs only 1 of 2 girls from her litter- but even her sister is much larger than she is.) We also don‚Äôt know what the litter is mixed with- is it possible she‚Äôs just more of ‚Äúthe other breed‚Äù than she is Pyrenees? 

I‚Äôve also read that Pyrs are notoriously picky eaters so maybe this isn‚Äôt that unusual? I‚Äôm just seeing a lot of conflicting advice about what to do with her diet. First I read to supplement her meals with extra protein (boiled chicken, eggs, etc.) but then I read that this is reinforcing her picky behavior because now she will hold out for the good stuff and not eat her kibble! I‚Äôm so frustrated. At the end of the day, we just want her to be happy and healthy (both our vet and trainer say she is healthy and lean, she‚Äôs by no means skin and bones or anything, but I‚Äôve never had a dog who won‚Äôt eat!) does anyone have any advice? Or anecdotes about your pyrfectly picky Pyrs? :) Thanks in advance! "

770,[discussion] I made a mistake that probably caused my boy so much pain.,dogs,t3_abdd5c,15,False,False,abdd5c,"I recently got a Dogtra collar for his training that the trainer recommended. It definitely works, but I didn‚Äôt take enough time to read the instructions since I tend to have the mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll figure it out as I go‚Äù. I had all of the controls figured out. Never used the zaps since I‚Äôm not mentally ready for that. Well, what I missed from not reading the instructions was that you shouldn‚Äôt keep the collar on too long and should change its position on your dog often. I only realized that mistake when I took it off of him a few minutes ago to give him a bath. The prongs got into his skin and the underside of the collar‚Äôs box and surrounding fur was wet (I assume from the fluid coming from the holes to prongs made). I feel absolutely awful that I did take time to read the instructions for what I was putting on my best friend and I‚Äôve been crying ever since I took it off from how much pain he was probably in from all of that. He couldn‚Äôt tell me it was digging in and my negligence probably made him suffer so much... the wound was obviously very red, but there wasn‚Äôt any blood. The vet is closed, but as soon as it opens I‚Äôm taking him to get it looked at ASAP. He won‚Äôt let me look at the spot and practically sprints when I reach for it, but keeps coming back since I‚Äôve been crying so hard about it. How could I do something so dumb? How could I care about another living creature so much, but not even read the user manual for more than 2 pages? What kind of dead beat dog dad am I? Do I even deserve a dog? Obviously not. I wish I could explain to him how sorry I am. He‚Äôs been itching at the collar for the past couple days and was shaking (like what dogs do when they‚Äôre wet) when he was completely dry, but I didn‚Äôt even notice that it might‚Äôve been because of the collar. The moment I saw to wounds I tried to look through his past medications that I still had left to see if there was anything I could start giving him until the vet is open. All he had that could probably help was some antibiotics and stuff for itching (from when he got neutered a few months ago). I‚Äôll give him those until the vet says otherwise. I‚Äôm such an idiot. How could I make such a mindless mistake? And any hate I get for this is definitely well deserved. What kind of idiot would do something like this? I guess me obviously... 

As I write this it‚Äôs been about a half hour, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about what an awful dog dad I am. My mom said a shower would make me feel better, but I can‚Äôt get my boys pain out of my head. I might be overreacting, but the thought of it just keeps bringing me to tears. He‚Äôs helped me so much but I couldn‚Äôt even do that much for him in return. "
771,[discussion] buying a trained dog,dogs,t3_ab94xv,7,False,False,ab94xv,Hi r/dogs/! My husband and I are thinking about buying a trained dog. We really have a specific breed/personality in mind (golden or lab retriever) and have not had great luck with rescues. Either they have had strict rules we have not met or our trial adoptions failed because the dog had severe separation anxiety. We work full time and a puppy is not feasible. We also don't feel equiped to deal with separation anxiety. Has anyone gone this route before?

775,[HELP] Dog growls when cuddling,dogs,t3_ab8e6b,12,False,False,ab8e6b,"I'm pet sitting for this adorable labradoodle for 3 weeks. We're about 2 days in and he has been showing signs of aggression. He will run up to me and sit on my lap (even though he's really too big) or lay on me if he can, and put his head on my lap or next to my face etc. Clearly trying to be as close as possible. If I stop petting him he'll nudge my hand with his nose and nuzzle harder. But eventually he'll start to growl and show his teeth. I've tried avoiding petting him in places that it seems like the behavior starts. For instance, the first time I was scratching behind his ears, so I tried avoiding the head and just slowly petting his back, but it doesn't seem to be connected with touching a certain place. I also tried saying ""no"" firmly, but not yelling and walking away, but he will immediately press his whole weight against me and then I have to basically push him off. He's normally pretty timid. His owner said that he usually hides under the bed when a new person comes, but he came right up and tried to jump on me and was very playful. She also said he only ""play growls"". I'm not sure what to do because as soon as I lay down to go to sleep he wants to lay directly on me, but I'm not going to let a dog that is snarling press his face against my neck while I'm sleeping. I'm not afraid of him, but it's not really conducive to getting a good nights sleep. I tried putting him in his own bed in the other room with his special blanket, but as soon as I close the door he is scratching and howling and throwing his full weight against it. I'm not sure how to solve this, because I'm not initiating the contact, and I don't want to deprive him of affection, but I don't want to reward his behavior."

Ive already made an appointment with a vet for Wednesday this week but Im just asking out of curiosity

782,[HELP] At my wits end with rescue pit AND boyfriend.,dogs,t3_aba0ue,11,False,False,aba0ue,"I‚Äôm hoping someone has some ideas because this dog is starting to ruin my home and put a serious strain on my relationship.

6 months ago my boyfriend and I decided to adopt a dog together. We already have a 5 year old pit that we‚Äôve had since she was a puppy and she‚Äôs a rockstar. We found out about a year and a half male pit who was with a rescue from our local grocer. We introduced him to our other dog and they got along fine, we bring him home, then the issues start.

I will say my boyfriend and I have differing philosophy‚Äôs on raising a dog. He believes in ‚Äúletting a dog be a dog‚Äù and does not want to train with commands, teach them not to jump, or have them learn tricks. I‚Äôm okay with most of that, but I feel like teaching dogs to not jump is a part of good behavior. This dog weighs almost 70lbs, when he jumps on you or walks on you, it doesn‚Äôt tickle.

The main issue we have with him is absolutely constant accidents. We got the dog at 18 months and for the first year of his life he was forced to live almost exclusively in a cage where he was only let out to stud and make money for his heroin addict owner. Needless to say he hates crates. We still have to put him in because we work and if we leave him out he will have accidents everywhere. When he is out and we are home he almost never has accidents, but he cannot be trusted at all outside the crate when we are not here and becomes aggressive to the point of scaring me when I try to put him in, to the point that I usually will never do it and make my boyfriend unless I have no choice. For example today I am off and he is working and I tried to put him in with a toy and treats and he was still growling and nipping at my fingers and showing teeth to the point that I gave up and let him stay out. I took him out to potty before I left and he went. I came home to 5 poops and a pee after being gone only 2 hours. I am at my wits end.

784,[Help] My 5 year old chihuahua-terrier has slept in my bed ever since I've had him. How to change this?,dogs,t3_ab8k89,2,False,False,ab8k89,"Hi All. I LOVE cuddling with my dog all night but also recognize that him being an animal kind of makes the bed dirty quicker with dog hair, etc. We are moving and I have heard that that is a good time to introduce a new routine. I am hoping an open crate with his own soft bed plus lots of treats will get him to stay out of our bed, but I also forsee him getting very whiny if he doesn't get to sleep in the bed with us. Advice? 

I have never tried to change this behavior before so I am sure after 5 years this might be a real challenge. I just would like a cleaner bed essentially. We can cuddle plenty of other times! Thanks in advance."
785,[Help] Recent toy possessiveness/aggression in our dog,dogs,t3_abbxbs,4,False,False,abbxbs,"Hi there. I wanted to see if anyone has experience with what my wife and I are experiencing with our rescue.

We rescued our mini poodle mix about 3.5 years ago, and she's now about 4.5 years old. She's healthy, well fed, on a regular flea a tick med regimen, has her teeth professionally cleaned and is groomed by our vet. Overall, she's a good and happy pup.

She does experience separation anxiety, and for this, we give her a regular dose of 75 mg Zylkene. 

Within the last few months, she's grown possessive of her toys to the point of growling, nose butting and nipping when we try to take them from her. She'll play fetch regularly for a few rounds, but at some point, she holds the toy and will grow aggressive when we try to take it. It never happened within the first 2 or so years, then it only happened when strangers played with her (which was rare) and over the last few months, we see it with close family that she knows well and even my wife and I. 

When it happens, we take away the toy, correct her verbally and stop play. But the growing regularity of it is very concerning.

Anyone have any experience with this type of behavior? Thanks for your advice!"

795,[Fluff] Adopted a rescue pup today!,dogs,t3_ab3quk,16,False,False,ab3quk,"Hey All!

Long time lurker, first time poster in r/dogs. I'm so glad to be a part of this community. My husband and I just adopted the sweetest rescue puppy today. We have been waiting for this moment for a while (we finally have a house with fenced in backyard and a dog park across the street), we are so lucky!

We decided to go with a puppy rescue here in CO that rescues pups from high kill shelters in TX and NM. Our girl, Lola, came from NM. She's a 13 week old shepherd mix.. we believe she may be a shepherd/lab mix. Man, she is perfect! No accidents so far (we are fully expecting some) and has already learned the word ""sit"". She isn't aggressive with our cat, mostly curious. Our cat, Lucy, hissed once and now they can at least both sleep in the same room so long as Lola is in the crate. They sit and look at each other a lot, but no barking or hissing. I don't know if they will grow to be friends or just kind of co-exist. As long as it's a peaceful existence I'm good.

Our biggest worry was getting our cat (original #1baby) used to a dog and making sure the dog wouldn't be aggressive. So far so good! We are continuing to encourage them to interact and provide love and treats to both when they behave. I would love any tips on this if you have some! Our cat is 4 and is used to being an ""only child"", so I'm really proud of her so far for being so cautious and curious rather than scared or mean. We have a baby gate with a cat door so that Lucy can go upstairs to have some space from the dog if needed. We don't plan on leaving the dog unsupervised on the first floor until she is much older (6-12 months depending on how she does with a little freedom).

My husband has this entire week off of work to acclimate the pup, help with a routine and schedule, and get a vet appt in.

She's sleeping now on her memory foam bed with her toys all around her. It breaks my heart to know this is probably the most comfortable she has been in a while.

Basically, I'm in love!

797,[help] Puppy Blues,dogs,t3_abakxq,6,False,False,abakxq,"This weekend my fianc√© and I drove 7 hours to rescue a special needs dog. We genuinely felt called to this dog for a variety of reasons, so the 14 total hours on the road, the airbnb, finding the space for her in our home, the extra costs for her condition, it all seemed worth it. 

Let me interject by saying I know that in a couple months, everything will be okay. I know we are in a transition period. But man, it‚Äôs a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. 

We have another dog, who is truly my best friend. Everyone has that ONE dog that stands out among the rest, the one they‚Äôll remember forever. Arya is that dog for me. I truly believe I can never have another dog that I connect with like I do her. She is just it for me. That being said, she is super dog friendly and did well enough with the introduction, so we drove new dog home. 

The place we rescued her from listed her as only 66lbs &amp; medium levels for energy. This was perfect bc Arya is 56lbs and mid level energy as well. But what the rescue didn‚Äôt mention, is that due to new dog‚Äôs medical condition (EPI) her ideal weight is closer to 75-80lbs. This dog is HUGE. Which would be fine, but she plays very rough. And Arya usually plays semi-rough, but now this new huge dog is overwhelming her. She goes from having a good time to a terrible one pretty quick. 

I broke down today because I feel like we made the wrong call on adopting this dog. She‚Äôs so much overbearing than how they described her. If I had known all of this, we wouldn‚Äôt have made the call on adopting her. 

Aside from Arya, I would be overjoyed to give this dog a home. She is so beautiful and I‚Äôm happy to pay the price of her medications and take all the steps with her. If I didn‚Äôt have Arya, I would be obsessed. Now I‚Äôm just worried that Arya won‚Äôt acclimate well or we made the decision bringing this dog into our home. 

I know when we first adopted Arya it took a while to adjust, and I know I didn‚Äôt feel THIS connected to her until 6-8 months in. And I know it‚Äôll get better and the dogs will acclimate to each other.. but I still feel so much anxiety and I‚Äôm so upset about how things are going. I just need some encouragement, success stories, or words of wisdom to help get through this. "

801,"[Help] puppy vomiting, eye &amp; nasal discharge",dogs,t3_aba2vw,8,False,False,aba2vw,"My girlfriend and I have a puppy (Ellie) who is celebrating her four month birthday today. We got her about a month and a half ago as a companion for our older dog(Maggie), who turns two years old on January 7th. Ellie has not finished her entire round of puppy boosters, her final dosage is scheduled for Wednesday, January 2nd (two days from now). About two days ago Ellie began having eye discharge which persists throughout the day, and yesterday we noticed she had a runny nose.

This morning Ellie ate normally and was playful as normal. She pooped and I noticed it seemed to be a little larger than normal, slightly more firm, and slightly darker. The only change to her diet has been a cod skin treat that she got yesterday and the day before, and denti-sticks that we added three days ago. I thought absolutely nothing of the poop, it seemed within the normal realm of variation for her poop types. Yeah, I pay close attention to her poop cause I‚Äôm a paranoid puppy daddy. This morning it was dark and I didn‚Äôt specifically look for blood or anything, so didn‚Äôt note anything.

At around 9 am my girlfriend texted me and said Ellie had thrown up twice, losing all her food. My girlfriend fed her again and then Ellie vomited again. We haven‚Äôt fed her after that. I‚Äôm home now and Ellie seems a little less energetic than normal but at time of writing she‚Äôs up and about playing with her big sister and my girlfriend.

Background:

She always plays hard and sleeps harder, and she‚Äôll normally spend the majority of her time napping from about 8 am-1pm, unless we interrupt her nap with a trip to the nearby park. The park isn‚Äôt a dog specific park, but it‚Äôs a large, open area where people take their dogs off the leash and let them roam and run. We always pick her up when other dogs come up to us and I‚Äôm very vigilant with her when she‚Äôs on the ground regarding poop and garbage so she doesn‚Äôt eat it. She‚Äôs eaten poop before which caused some concern but not in the past week or so, and we always catch her in the act and remove it from her mouth. 

I went to the SPCA (where she‚Äôs scheduled for last round of boosters on Wednesday) in person and explained the situation, they were unable to offer much assistance given that it‚Äôs a holiday. Our normal vet is also closed. 

Pending actual vet input regarding her symptoms our current course of action is to:

-watch her closely
-check her temperature every hour(currently it‚Äôs 101.6)
-ensure she drinks water continuously
-ensure her play with the older dog is not overly vigorous
-take frequent, light walks to ensure she urinates enough and gets fresh air

If she gets any worse between now and her appointment, or if she develops diarrhea/bloody stool we will take her to an emergency vet immediately.

Is there anything else we should look at or be concerned with?

Do her symptoms give any of you a clue as to what may be wrong? Currently our assumption is that she‚Äôs got some sort of stomach bug, but the concern is that she could be developing distemper or some sort of infection.

TL;DR puppy who‚Äôs last round of boosters is due on Wednesday has developed a runny nose and eye discharge over the past 2-3 days, this morning she can‚Äôt keep food down. She visits a large area in a park frequented by other dogs a few times a week. She doesn‚Äôt have diarrhea or any other major symptoms."

803,[fluff] Passive Aggressive Elevator Lady,dogs,t3_ab1d0i,14,False,False,ab1d0i,"Kind of a rant lol. 

Today when my dog and I were coming back from the dog park, we got into the elevator with an older woman. She looked lovingly at my dog and said: 

‚ÄúOh darling, you poor thing! Having to go out in the cold without a coat on! You must be freezing. Poor baby, your mommy needs to buy you a coat so you can bundle up‚Äù 

She didn‚Äôt say a single word to me; she just spoke to my dog. And it‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve had people say/do similar things. Something about having a smaller dog (mini poodle) makes people think my dog NEEDS to be dressed up in sweaters or else he‚Äôll freeze to death. 

For reference, it was 55 degrees today (~13C for my non-American friends). I myself had worn a winter coat to walk to the dog park, and was actually sweating and had to take it off by the time I got there. If I was too hot in a coat, chances are my dog would have also been too hot in a coat - especially because he already has own, natural, built-in coat! Which is very thick and long right now because it‚Äôs winter. And as a poodle, his fur was specifically bred to be dense and warm so that he could swim in icy lakes to retrieve waterfowl. 

And for the record, he HAS a winter coat that ‚Äúmommy‚Äù already bought him, which I don‚Äôt use unless he actually needs it. 

I don‚Äôt know why, but the whole situation just rubbed me the wrong way. Like, first of all, you shouldn‚Äôt be trying to co-parent a stranger‚Äôs dog. Second, if you think my dog is being mistreated or abused, you need to tell me directly instead of passive aggressively talking to my dog instead of me. "

He's normally a very stubborn and high-energy dog - under normal circumstances, he can escape from pretty much every attempt to contain him - but for the last couple of weeks he's suddenly been extremely stiff and lethargic. He walks with a funny, stiff gait, trembles violently and seems to have a hard time getting up and lying down. He eats some days, but other days he shows no interest in food. He also seems extremely sensitive to touch - you can usually pet him with no reaction, but sometimes if something touches his face, he starts yelping and making loud shrieking noise, and seems to be in a lot of pain. We live in an area with a lot of ticks, and I think he might have Lyme disease (the other dog tested positive for Lyme last year but has never shown any symptoms). I'm not a vet by any stretch though, so I could be completely off the mark.

We live in an extremely rural, remote area and the soonest we can get him to see a vet is three days from now. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to relieve his discomfort or encourage him to eat? Warm bath? Wet food instead of dry? Is there anything I can give him?"
808,[Help] Harness for a large dog,dogs,t3_ab4xi8,13,False,False,ab4xi8,"I've never used a harness before. My search on Amazon returned a whole bunch of them that had a chest plate not connected by an under chest band to the torso band. I didn't see any other designs/structure. Pictures showed the chest plate at chest level. The two I tried had it up at the base of my dog's neck, like a low lying collar, and not adjustable to be able to drop it lower. They were the right size according to the charts but just not designed properly in my opinion. The torso band was the only place force would have been applied if I had to stop her from a lunge.

I went to an expensive dog store and found an Easy Sport that had a perfectly fitting, wide and low neck to chest strap with an under belly panel attached to the torso strap. It is padded all around so no strap/buckle adjustment part is directly on her skin. However, the belly band part, shortened as much as possible gapped down about four inches below her belly.

The I found a Black Rino on  Amazon that has the chest/back of neck band attached to the torso strap. Easy to make adjustments that fit,  but the adjustable band parts are all in contact with her skin, which gives me pause. Also,I thought that harnesses were supposed to give you more control when necessary without choking the dog like a collar can do.  I feel that having the leash attachment in the middle of the dog's body gives very little control. Does it just feel that way because I am not used to it? 

I'm thinking of having the Easy Sport  torso band adjustments modified by a friend with an industrial sewing machine. I do not think that the Easy Sport will chafe anywhere because of the padding and because all of the banding is wide so it won't cut into the skin.

My dog is a female Cane Corso who has had at least one litter of pups (probably more because I suspect she was used for breeding before being dumped). I don't want anything that would rub on her nipples. She is large and strong.  I want a bit more security than just a collar when I walk her.

Anyone have suggestions?"

Or conversely, if your pet saw negative side effects. Above all else, I just want to make sure my pups have long, healthy lives.

812,UPDATE: Dog bit my boyfriend [Help],dogs,t3_aaznsl,5,False,False,aaznsl,"Original Post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/aavg83/dog\_bit\_my\_boyfriend\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/aavg83/dog_bit_my_boyfriend_help/)

Thanks everyone for all the advice :) I had to reschedule with the behaviorist because of the weather but we are going on Tuesday and my boyfriend is coming with me. I agree 100% with all of you that this is entirely his fault. I think I was so upset and panicked because it was shocking and scary at first but I've calmed down now and I'm more so angry at my boyfriend at this point. At first he was trying to defend himself and say that he's wrestled with him and picked him up like that multiple times and has never gotten a negative reaction which is true but there were two times that I did it and he growled at me so it's really no excuse. I told him from day one that the dog was sensitive about his underarm/shoulder area based on his reaction with me. After awhile he calmed down and isn't acting defensive anymore. Now he feels awful about what happened and guilty. He's on board with everything I'm doing. I think the primary reason I want to go to a behaviorist is so that my boyfriend can hear what he has to say. I know this behaviorist personally because I used to work at a rescue and he would take dogs there and work with them for free so I know he'll come and give good advice. I sat him down and told him that he needs to listen to me now about rules with the dog and he understands now. He completely deserved what he got and I think it's a lesson learned for him.

Luckily, there's no actual bite history paper trail because my boyfriend was already on antibiotics for an unrelated injury and stitches are not needed for the wound. I'm not sure if it's a law in every state but where I'm at nurses and doctors will actually refuse to treat you and won't even look at your injury unless you report the dog or cat that bit you so that was definitely a concern but right now it isn't a problem. So overall things turned out alright. As long as he now respects everything I say and listens to me about it I think things will be ok with us. My dog will be ok too :) He's a good boy and my number 1. If it came down to it, I'd pick him over my boyfriend any day."

I went to see the puppy in person and it is a teeny tiny (maybe runt?) puppy (we‚Äôll call her Poppy) that is 13-14 weeks old now and not even 2 lbs yet. She is in a litter of 5 other puppies and 4 of them are a bit bigger than her. I saw her parents too which seemed healthy and over 5 lbs now. The owners predicted that Poppy will be 2-3lbs full-grown. Is that normal? They never advertised her as ‚Äúteacup‚Äù so i‚Äôm not too worried about how she was bred because her parents are regular toy size poodles. I guess her being a ‚Äúrunt‚Äù, should I be worried about future health issues? 

Poppy has all of her shots, just needs rabies shots when she gets older. Owners said I could do a full health exam on her if I wanted. 

When I hold her she is just so light, I like smaller dogs, but is she too tiny??

I have been playing with the thought of getting a dog, mainly for companionship but also for basic exercise. Experience wise I grew up with both large dogs (Border Collie) and small dogs of a variety of breeds.

Since I live in a 2 room apartment* I was thinking a small/Mid dog that doesn't require too much space, which made me think of ""my"" dog from when I was a child. Thing is, the people we got him from stated that he was was a Tibetan Spaniel/Papillon mix, but searching for that online gives me pretty longhaired and kinda short legged ones while he was shorthaired and somewhat athletic.

So the question is, what kind of doggo did I grow up with?

820,Dog recognize family members? [Discussion],dogs,t3_ab3m2p,0,False,False,ab3m2p,"Our dog has always been vary of strangers whether it‚Äôs strangers on the street or friends visiting. Unless the person has been at our home multiple times and interacting with the dog a lot he will bark up a storm and back up when they try to touch him. It will take him a few minutes to warm up to new people especially men. He is fine with mostly anyone after a while but the initial reaction is fear.

Recently we had family staying at our house for the first time. And Nox was so much better with them from the start. It has been the same with my family as well as my husbands family. We had two roommates in the house for about 8 days and at the end the dog would still bark when they entered the house or woke up in the morning. Not so with anyone of our family ever and we had three separate visits in the last 3 months. He is still the same with non relatives so he hasn‚Äôt changed in general. He lets them cuddle him and listens to them, he only barks when he hears them enter the porch and stops immediately when he sees them. Like he would with us. He was just immediately relaxed around them. 

My guess is either their smell or our reaction to them. But I would think we are equally relaxed around best friends we see a lot more often than family we see once a year and that he has never met before. 

Anyone had similar experiences?

823,[Discussion] Using corrections,dogs,t3_ab4zmi,12,False,False,ab4zmi,"I'm sure most of us here know who Cesar Millan is. The Dog Whisperer is, understandably so, not very popular in this subreddit. His methods are counterintuitive at best and destructive at worst. But while the things he *does* are questionable, I find myself agreeing with a lot of what he *says*. He emphasizes the importance of discipline and setting limitations for your dog, something a lot of dog owners don't really do. 

I'm bringing Cesar up because I'm curious what people in the sub think of corrections like his world famous ""tsch"" sound. Besides positive reinforcement, is a stern but harmless ""tsch"" or ""no"" useful? Is dog discipline a good balance between positive reinforcement and corrections?

My impression right now is that corrections are fine for a dog that's fairly normal in behavior, but can only worsen things when used to rehabilitate a highly aggressive dog."
824,[Help] My family supported a backyard breeder,dogs,t3_ab36en,24,False,False,ab36en," I am 17, I have wanted a dog my whole life. Now that my siblings are old enough to also share the responsibility of a dog, my parents decided that this was the right time for us to get a dog. Initially, I was overjoyed. My dad wanted a puppy so that we could have the experience of raising a baby dog, and forming a close bond with it. So our initial look was at shelters. Any puppy we saw was either afraid or apprehensive (my parents wanted a friendly, energetic dog that was happy go lucky off the bat) or was already being snatched up.

Our second look was breeders. My parents were unwilling to spend more than $1000 on a dog, so that quickly ruled breeders out of the question since well-bred pups usually cost upwards of that (and for good reason!).

So at that point we should have stopped looking, but my parents were pretty desperate for a puppy at this point. They turned to Craigslist and saw an adorable litter of Golden Retriever puppies at $700/ea. The ad also showed a healthy adult dog that was supposed to be the mom. I tried to talk them out of it but they made an appointment with the woman anyway. She said she had one puppy left, a male.

I told them that this puppy could have any number of hidden health or behavioral issues and they seemed to be considering this in the car ride to the parking lot this woman offered to meet us in. But when she brought the puppy out, all bets were off. He was so adorable and friendly, sniffing and sitting at our feet and chasing us around. The woman said he was ""8 weeks old"" and provided some proof of him having been vaccinated and dewormed. She said that her friend who owned an English cream retriever had studded her own Red golden retriever and this puppy was one of the products. She offered to take us to a park and let us play with him.

I admit at this point I really wanted to just adopt this little guy. So on the way to the park I didn't say anything. At the park, the pup sealed the deal. He was so outgoing and lovely. The woman really pushed the sale: saying that she had other people who wanted to see him, etc. We brought him home for $550. He has no AKC papers or anything to prove his pedigree.

After a few days having had him, he is a bundle of joy. He loves people, and doesn't have any discernible behavioral issues. He has coccidia, but that is a common puppy disease. He is mostly well behaved. But I'm beginning to sense that this woman was dishonest with us. He looks much closer to 5 or 6 weeks than the 8 weeks we were told-- he barely has the bite strength to break solid kibble. He also might not be a purebred Golden Retriever-- he carries his tail curled and has small ears and an... unconventional muzzle for his breed. Either he is not purebred or he just isn't well-bred. Either is likely.

I don't know what to think. I can't stomach the idea that this puppy might have huge health issues (like hip dysplasia and joint issues) later on in his life and will have to suffer as a consequence of our actions... how can I confront this? Is it true that most if not all BYB puppies have major issues of some sort?"
825,[Help] Biting legs and going insane on the street crossing?,dogs,t3_ab64e5,3,False,False,ab64e5,"For context - my dog is an almost 7 months old border collie pup. Usually she's sweet, has some issues with scavenging and guarding whatever she finds, but that's something we have an idea on how to work on. She does well with leash, rarely pulls, can walk off leash as well around nearby meadows or woods. Does really well with training too.

The problems start when I'm walking with her around the university near my home - the area has a lot of grass, trees, a small park, lot of space for a dog - that's on the other side of a quite busy street. Blue is used to cars and public transport, it doesn't bother her. She waits for a green light like a little fluffy angel. When we start walking across, it happens around 80% of time, for no reason apparently, it feels so random - she starts growling and nipping/biting my legs, it used to be just ankles, but today she's even bit my knee. It's never enough to draw blood, but it hurts, gets up stuck on the crossing and is just... embarrassing.

I can't think of any reason for such behavior, we've been training her to cross the street with our usual wait/go commands she reacts to. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific, I don't know why it happens only on the crossings... Will be grateful for any ideas and possible solutions. Leave/calm/don't which we use when she wants to grab something or becomes ""crazy"" don't work."
826,[help] I'm so fed up with my sister who refuses to take care of her (now my) dogs,dogs,t3_aaxya3,15,False,False,aaxya3,"To make a very long story short, my sister (12, f) got a morkie last year. Then, she got 2 other puppies (yorkie and a chihuahua mix). She eventually grew to resent the first dog because it didn't seem to love her as much as it loved me. Though she liked the second dog, she wanted a white dog and made my mom's life very difficult in order to get what she wanted. Even after getting what she wanted, my sister was still unsatisfied and eventually grew bored/lazy of them.

I (20, f), who still lives home with her and our mom, had to take care of all 3 of them. My sister helped out a bit at first, but like I said, she eventually grew disinterested because it was too much work for her. We had to rehome the 3rd one early in May for various reasons and it was one of the best decisions I ever made for both myself and the poor dog.

The other 2 are sweet. I've tried my best to make sure their needs are being met, but as a full-time student who also works and whose mental health is fragile and overall poor, I am so tired of doing all the work and having no support whatsoever.

From the very beginning I thought having dogs was a bad idea, but my impulsive mother was like, hey, don't worry about it, I'll pay for their bills, yadda yadda yadda. I don't resent her for thinking that owning a dog, let alone 2, would be a piece of cake. I just resent how she enables my spoiled sister's behaviors. I am now the sole dog owner because, quite frankly, that title no longer applies to my sister anymore.

I always walk them (though I will admit where I had some days where I couldn't and it's actually getting harder to do so in the winter, but I'm really trying). On the days I go to school they go to a dogsitter's house. I always make sure they have fresh water and food to eat. I tried potty training them in the early days of getting them, but have just stuck with using potty pads. They also pee/poop outside.

I make sure they're up to date with their shots and are in good health. I love them and can't imagine my life without them. But it's hard, you know? Sometimes, I'd feel guilty for thinking that I wished they could morph into one dog so it'd take less work.

I've had to sit my sister down and talk about her selfishness, but it's hard to lecture at a twelve year old who's been coddled for almost her entire life and just has no sense of responsibility. She's super manipulative too, knowing fully well that our mom would defend her. Whenever I ask my sister to help walk the dogs, our mom always says something like, oh no, she can't because of the weather. If it's too hot, she might get mosquito bites (though, to be fair, my sister does have a rare allergy to certain mosquitos), If it's too cold, she'll get a cold. UGH. Even today, I was feeling under the weather and asked my sister to walk them for a bit. She ended up calling our mom, who called me to say that my sister couldn't. So I did.

None of this is fair. I turn to Reddit because my mom doesn't know how to put her foot down and my sister continues to be neglectful (and guess what, she has a bunny and a pet hamster now! and she takes care of them because they're more low-maintenance than dogs). This post started out as a rant, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do. My happiness matters too, right?

827,"[Help] My best friend was previously a stray, and I don‚Äôt know how to break her ‚Äústray‚Äù behavior.",dogs,t3_ab3sk4,0,False,False,ab3sk4,"I‚Äôve (25F) had the dog for almost a year now, she‚Äôs two years this month. Birdy is a Kelpie x Pitbull mix, and was a stray in a state with mostly kill shelters. She is the most affectionate, goofy, kind of ditzy dog - and our other dog is her best friend (we raised our other dog from a puppy onwards). Birdy loves other dogs, new people, but she has some behaviors I can only think is due to her history. 

1) She cannot be restrained without high anxiety. 
Ex) She‚Äôs kennel trained but can‚Äôt be in the crate without our other dog to calm her. If you cuddle her too tightly she grunts and removes herself. If you put her on a leash/harness she becomes unfocused, hyperactive, and pulls like she‚Äôs trying to get off the leash. 

2) This ties into the first one - when on a leash she does a high pitched screaming. It honestly sounds like a velociraptor. She gets so excited she gets the tippy taps, wags her tail, but she also screams - particularly when she sees other dogs. Off leash she does not scream. It terrifies other dog owners as they think it‚Äôs an aggressive behavior, although it‚Äôs been proven it is not. 

3) She scarfs her food so fast and scrounges for any and all food scraps. She licks the furniture, tables, cabinets, floors, gets into any trash no matter how secure (she‚Äôs opened cabinets and locked lids). When she eats every 10-12 hours she chokes on her food. We got a puzzle bowl that helps a lot but she still eats it in record time. 

I just want my best friend to be less anxious and for others to see how wonderful she is, but these behaviors scare new people. "
828,[Help] My dog keeps attacking my girlfriend's dog,dogs,t3_ab1wyu,1,False,False,ab1wyu,"Ok,  so some background information. My girlfriend and I have been together for 10 months now and we are very close to moving in together. We both love our own dogs as well as each other's dogs very much. We try to show equal attention and affection to all three dogs whenever we can. I have a female ~8 yr old dachshund-boxer mix (Casey), and she has two dogs, a male ~8 yr old retriever mix (Hank) and a male ~11 yr old Pit-Lab mix (Lou). The two younger dogs (Casey and Hank) are both very loving and playful dogs, and will play fight all the time. Lou, being the oldest of the group, is much more reserved, but very sweet and has gravitated towards me. I work long days sometimes and Casey has been staying at my girlfriend's house for quite some time now with no issues until recently.

So Casey has attacked Lou three times now and I've become incensed with the situation so I'm looking for help and some answers. The first time it happened, we had just given Lou a bath, and we were showing him love and excitement and apparently that riled Casey up to the point where she attempted to mount Lou from behind (size difference not withstanding). It all happened so quickly, so it's difficult to know what really happened, but apparently when Lou shrugged Casey off, she went for the neck and he was overpowered and lay on his back attempting to fight her off. We managed to separate the two of them before any damage occurred, but Lou was shaken up for a bit. He's a nervous dog regardless, thunderstorms and loud noises bother him, but for this fight he was shaking for a good 10-15 minutes. 

The second time she attacked him, they were outside and my girlfriend and I heard Lou's yelping. Again, no damage occurred, but she did not respond to verbal commands, and I had to separate them physically. 

Finally, the third time this happened occurred last night. My girlfriend and I were in the middle of some... extracurricular activities that involved a lot of agreeing with each other. We occasionally tend to get a little rough with each other and last night was no exception. Suddenly we heard Lou's yelping, and I had to separate them yet again. 

Casey has never truly been an aggressive dog. She has nipped at my kids on occasion when they've grabbed her tail, and I'll sometimes joke that she's ""in heat"" even though she's been neutered, because she'll try to hump my legs on occasion. But I truly don't believe her to be an aggressive dog. 

Lou is even farther from what you would call an aggressive dog. He's just one of those once-in-a-lifetime dogs with the soul of a saint. Which makes this fighting they've been doing even more puzzling. 

My girlfriend and I are just looking for some answers to her behavior and what, if anything, we can do to prevent it."

I was spending a great Sunday night just browsing through sub reddits. I thought I would find a new group for Kik to join. I had the pleasure of meeting someone new. Her name is Kelsey. Kelsey allowed me to join her Kik group and was very sweet and welcoming.  We got to talking chatting, and we started to open up. She felt comfortable enough to share some news with me. After showing my dog to Kelsey. She began to tell me some horrible news.

 (I may get some get some details messed up. I appoligize in advance Kelsey.)

Kelsey has a 5 year old beautiful boxer named Chloe. She explained that Chloe has been having a ton of issues the prior week. For some reason. Chloe ingested something and is not able to pass the object. They tried everything they could. Until they took Chloe to vet. The vet gave her something to to try to also pass that object. After some odd days Chloe still hasn't been able to pass this object still. She hasn't been able to eat or drink for the whole week. Kelsey was told by the vet that the best thing to do for her pup was to put her down. Kelsey almost had me in tears. A 5 year old pup, that she loves and adores has to go way to early right before the new year on a stroke of bad luck. I felt her hurting even though we are miles apart.

She sent me a pic of her boxer. I broke out in tears. Her dog is a spitting image of my boxer who I lost before I got my new dog Thomas. I couldn't believe it. I honestly thought I was staring at Ginger. It blew my mind. Then and there I wanted to do something nice for Kelsey. But I just didn't know what. Time is short. She's putting down Chloe tomorrow. And I want her to have something that shows we are right there with both of them.

Reddit dinged in my head. Kelsey doesn't have Reddit. (Well not yet.) But I wanted her to see the love and support of the community and how things like like this happen for a reason. And with new friends and new experiences, it may be a tough ride but she has support.

So to my new friend Kelsey and her beautiful best friend Chloe. This life is over but you guys will never be apart. She's not gonna have to suffer anymore and it's time for her to rest comfortable.
She will always be your bed bud. Your best friend and your most trustworthy soul. 

Everything's gonna be okay. 

&lt;/3 MUCH LOVE CHLOE. FLY HIGH PUPPERS. FLY HIGH.

Kels. Thanks for being a new friend. I hope this makes your day just a bit easier. Much love. J."
835,[Help] 4 yr old male Shiba suddenly won‚Äôt stop whining,dogs,t3_ab2449,3,False,False,ab2449,"I apologize in advance for the long post. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy!

So, we went out of town for Christmas, dog came with us. He has taken many, many car trips in his life so nothing new there. We were visiting my cousin‚Äôs house who has 4 dogs of her own, one of which is male. My dog and her male dog were OBSESSED with each other while we were there. We stayed at an Air BNB down the road so they weren‚Äôt spending nights together and my dog was totally normal during the time they spent away from each other. So we get back home Tuesday night, everything is normal. Wednesday morning I wake up and start my work day routine. I work from home and as soon as I sit down at my desk he starts whining...and whined all day long. In addition to the whining, he‚Äôs running from each window, to the front door, all over like he‚Äôs looking for something/someone. This has been going on now for five days. The really weird part is, if anyone else comes over or I take him somewhere else, he goes back to totally normal behavior again! He‚Äôs also fine at night. At some point in the evening, he finally gives up and goes to sleep for the night. 

He‚Äôs eating, drinking, playing, walking, pooping, peeing, and isn‚Äôt hurt anywhere. I can‚Äôt figure out what might possibly be going on and I feel like I‚Äôm going insane listening to him whine and run from window to window. He is intact, so possibly there‚Äôs a dog in heat around? Just seems odd this coincided with us coming from from our Christmas trip...

836,Dog bit my boyfriend [Help],dogs,t3_aavg83,52,False,False,aavg83,"So last night our dog (6 or 7-year-old male Mastiff) was laying on the floor and my boyfriend went to get him up to take him up to bathe him. My boyfriend grabbed him underneath his front legs and tried to tug him up. I‚Äôve told him multiple times that this bothers the dog because he‚Äôs shown signs like growling in the past to indicate he doesn‚Äôt like being grabbed this way. He also has arthritis in his front legs which causes him discomfort. My boyfriend has never listened to me about this and likes to try and get my dog up this way. So this time the dog snarled and bit him in the face. My boyfriend is fine, he‚Äôs on antibiotics and has a bruised eye and a torn part of his ear. I‚Äôd say it was a level 3 dog bite as our dog reacted and got him once and then ran away scared instead of hanging on or going back for more.

However, I‚Äôm very worried about what I‚Äôm going to do about it. I‚Äôm meeting with a behavioralist and trainer today that I called immediately after it happened. I also have a vet appointment to assess his legs and consider other medication options for his arthritis. My boyfriend is acting like this isn‚Äôt a big deal and is taking the blame for grabbing the dog like that because I have told him endlessly to not do it because he‚Äôs shown signs that it causes him discomfort. The rule is now nobody can touch him In that way or pull on his shoulders and hopefully the behavioralist can help in some way or enlighten us a little bit about the situation. I feel like nobody around me is thinking this is a big deal (my boyfriend, my boyfriends parents, my mom, etc.) but I feel extremely upset and like maybe I should make a big deal about it. Am I responding in the right way? Should I be doing anything more? 

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs important to note but we just got back from a trip which we took him on. It was an 18 hour car ride and our dog was already irritated because of this.

My parents let our dogs into our garage, but my most frightful dog Roger has learned to whack at the handle which connects the garage into our main home (unable to lock this door).

Roger is ruining our wooden doors with the frantic scratching and his paranoia seems to have worsen. Tomorrow is New Year's Eve and I plan on giving him CBD oil to get through the evening.

839,Eating Food Your Dog Licked [Discussion],dogs,t3_ab3fbd,3,False,False,ab3fbd,"My dog stuck his face in my chicken caesar salad and licked around a little, but I just went ahead and ate it anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

In retrospect I'm a bit concerned about bacterium and zoonotic diseases (thanks google).

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm looking for anecdotes about eating stuff your dog has licked and whether you got sick or not. It seems plenty of owners share food (like ice cream etc.) with their dogs or let them lick their spoon, or even let them lick in their mouths and are fine, but it also seems theres some pretty creepy stuff they can carry around.

Heres an interesting one. [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/2rfdih/one\_of\_our\_dogs\_accidentally\_got\_me\_sick/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/2rfdih/one_of_our_dogs_accidentally_got_me_sick/)"
840,[breeds] what are some good breeds for us?,dogs,t3_ab4zfd,0,False,False,ab4zfd,"Introduction

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, have a bc mix. My parents bred field golden retrievers most of my life and have always said a house is not a home without a dog. I helped train these dogs and it was one of my chores to take care of the puppies. My husband was raised with rescue Great Danes and Mastiffs. So lots of big dog experience but no experience with small dogs.

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a¬†reputable breeder?

Will try breed specific rescues then breeder if necessary

Describe your ideal dog.

Affectionate, gregarious, confident, biddable, athletic (ie not braciphalic), good to go everywhere including fairs, hiking trails, dog park and resturants. Husband wants a dog that he can either pet while standing or he can pick up to pet.

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Yorkshire terrier: my mom has one that is super cool and lovable but he isn't good with kids and strange dogs so I worry this breed won't work.

Border terrier: sounds a lot like Yorkies but bred to be more dog friendly. Worried about being too stubborn.

Papillons and havanese: cute little dogs that seem smart enough but worried about being too barky.

Greyhounds: they are tall enough for my husband to pet without bending down but isn't giant. They seem chill in the house, affectionate, but also athletic. Problem being we'd prefer a rescue and they usually demand a fenced in yard. Also worry they'd escape a dog park.

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I would really like to do agility and/or obiedence competitions

Care Commitments

How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Currently we do daily 15 minute training sessions and 2 walks. In the winter the walks are 30 minutes long and in the summer they are 1 hour. I'd be willing to increase these time commitments. When our dog was a puppy I use to do 3x 5-15 minute training sessions.

During the weekends we normally go for hikes or outings. Hikes can be anywhere from 5 miles to 20. Outings include dog friendly festivals.

How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Winters we go on 2x 30 minute walks due to our dog's fear of darkness and being wet. Summers it's 2x 1 hour walks that includes going to a fenced in off-leash dog park (it's the only park within walking distance).

How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We currently brush our dog out 3x a week and do biweekly baths. I'd be willing to add another dog on this mix or start taking them to a groomer.

Personal Preferences

What size dog are you looking for?

Perferably small (less than 30 lbs) for easy apartment finding but it's not a necessity

How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding is fine (our current dog is crazy). Barking is a no because we live in an apartment. Slobber is fine.

How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not at all. Everywhere we go there's leash laws and our current dog is a runner so we are use to being leash constrained.

Dog Personality and Behavior

Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly would be nice. We definitelywant an affectionate dog. Open to have either a dog that just want to hang with us on the couch or a stage 10 clinger, but don't want a super independent dog.

Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

Prefer eager to please

How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Alert bark but greet them happily. Want them to happily greet people preferably without jumping on them.

Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

Lifestyle

How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

8 hours a day

What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

We both split caring for the dogs equally but it's just me and the hubby.

Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

Just another dog. No plans for any other animals but dogs.

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, we regularly baby sit friends kids and we see kids during outings.

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We plan to rent for the foreseeable future. Currently lease restrictions is under 120lbs, no German Shepherds, huskies, ""pit bulls"", great Danes, saint Bernards, or Mastiffs

What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Nope.

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

It's the PNW so 80s and clear in the summer, 40s and rainy in the winter.

841,"[Help] Wife and I rescued a 2 year old, female German Shepard. Need advice on introducing her to our 2 year old, female Siamese cat.",dogs,t3_aaxfgg,12,False,False,aaxfgg,"Title explains the situation. My wife and I rescued the Shepard in NC. We're driving back to our home in Ohio with the dog right now. My wife is worried that they won't get along and introducing the dog into our cat's life will change the cat's affectionate, playful personality. We've done our research and are confident in being able to train the dog how we want. The dog will stay in the crate for at least the first few weeks and we plan on gradually introducing them. Our cat has never shown aggression or dominant behavior, overall she's pretty chill. In the short time we've had the dog, she has been listening well. She is pretty active and excites easily but she's never had a big backyard to play in and run around like we have. Plus she's not fixed yet (that will be done very soon). Those factors combined with being moved multiple times in the past week I would think can excite any animal.



I know it'll take time to get them acquainted and we'll have to work with both of them. I keep telling my wife this but she's worried nonetheless. Any advice, methods, and/or tips on making this process easier would be greatly appreciated."
842,"[Help] We haven't slept since our female was spayed, because of our male",dogs,t3_aax76z,27,False,False,aax76z,"We had our female spayed couple days ago, and ever since she has been home, our male is driving us insane.  He whines all day/night, he won't eat as much as he usually does, he follows her around and tries to lick her private areas.. I knew some of this was going to happen, but not this much.  It is constant, 24/7 whimpering.  Our female is doing great, she doesn't appear to be in any pain and is acting normal.   Because of his whimpering, we can't get more than 5-10 minutes of sleep at a time.  We have tried separating them, keeping them together, kenneling them both.   We tried 'calming treats' and a thunder shirt as well.  Nothing is changing his behavior.  
  
Are there any home remedies to calm him down?  I have heard people talk about giving their dog benadryl to settle them down, but I am not sure if I want to do that, nor how I should do it.  Willing to try anything at this point though.

843,[Help] Dog is weird about eating kibble,dogs,t3_ab2yj4,17,False,False,ab2yj4,"I've had my dog for about a year now and for about 8 months she's been weird about her kibble. When we first got her she loved her kibble-- we used to put it in a treat ball so she would eat it slower. Then about 4 months in she stopped liking her kibble.

What we've been doing for awhile now is leaving the kibble out so she can eat it when she feels like it. Strangely the only time she'll touch the kibble is in the middle of the night. She usually eats half the bowl, which is about half a cup (she's 30lbs and used to eat 1 1/2 cups a day, but back then she was skinny and needed to gain weight). Sometimes she won't touch her food at all. There have been a few instances where she doesn't touch her food for a few days, so I hand feed her to her and she eats the whole bowl.

Lately I've been adding a raw egg to her food at night-- the past two nights she wolfed down the whole bowl. Tonight she won't touch it. If I try to feed it to her she shies away and gets super submissive, putting her head down a wagging her tail. I think she can feel that I'm frustrated so I've given up on that.

Other than that she gets a few spoonfuls of wet food in the morning, a dental stick, and treats throughout the day. She gets high value treats (cheese, beef liver, etc) every day because she's reactive and we need them to train her. We've brought this up to two vets, one said ""she'll eat when she's hungry"" and the other said to try a different kibble (which we did, she did the thing where she ate it for two days and then only ate it intermittently)

All in all, not sure if I should be concerned or if she is just being picky. Half a cup of food a day doesn't seem like enough to me, but the food is there for her if she's hungry.

TL;DR Dog will only sometimes eat her kibble, not sure if I should be concerned / try to fix this or leave it be

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: One follow up question-- if she is potentially just getting full off of treats, is that problematic? She does eat a lot of cheese, beef liver, milk bones, and other homemade treats. Probably over thinking this but just want to be sure :)

844,[Help] My 11 year old maltese x shitzu over exerted himself by chasing a younger dog at the park and now he is limping ans having trouble moving.,dogs,t3_ab1owh,3,False,False,ab1owh,"I was walking my dog and there were a few dogs at the off leash area of the park. He sniffed this young 1 year old whippet/terrier looking dog, who looked very lean and fast and they decided to chase each other. My dog is somewhat stubborn and I could see he was determined to catch the younger dog even though he has little chance. I could see him running quite alot and when they finally stopped he sat down panting and I could see his little back legs shaking.

I gave him some time to recover and then tried to get him to keep walking. He was struggling and now he was limping off his front paw. I had to carry him to the water and he drank, walked a little but was struggling and sat back down. I carried him home and have been monitoring him.

He ate all his meal (I carried him to the food but he limped back to his spot). He's moving a little but still limping and having trouble moving. It's been just over two hours now.

Should I be concerned? Is this normal that dogs over exert themselves?

Since he is an elderly dog (11 years old) I'm a little worried. Honestly it was nice that he ran around and I could see this youthful exuberance in him, but not at the expense of an injury or hurting himself.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

We only talk to the neighbors right next to us and they‚Äôre nice, but our neighbors across the street are the source of the problem. They have two little dogs that they let run around out in our cul de sac all the time unsupervised and not on leashes. We have problems with one of the dogs that‚Äôs an ankle biter who chases us up to our front door and generally goes onto the house property (one time I saw him in our backyard after he slipped through the fence bars). We‚Äôve usually ignored the dog but he had harassed not only us but my roommates girlfriend when she comes over.

Today was kind of my final straw point. I was out walking my dog and as I was walking back up to our house the little dog ran up to my dog and tried attacking him. Now my dog is a big 7 year old GSD mix that easily has 50+ pounds on the other dog, so I wasn‚Äôt really worried about the other dog hurting him.  But still it‚Äôs completely irresponsible to let your dog do that. Luckily the kids of our neighbor were out and managed to call the dog back before I had to forcibly get the dog away. I plan on talking to them the next time I see them and let them know what their dog is doing and let them know I will call animal control if the problem isn‚Äôt corrected. Is this an appropriate response? I‚Äôm going to give them a warning and notify them, and then if the issue still isn‚Äôt corrected I‚Äôll call animal control. 

I‚Äôm wondering if this is a valid course of action to take? Am I allowed to call animal control if the dog continues trying to attack our houses residents and guests?

My sister has a big busy household and couldn't afford the cost of the high doses of daily eye drops and regular eye tests. It was never an ideal situation with myself and my partner working full time but this pup had few options.

She gets daily off the lead walks normally very late at night and have begun walking her early in the morning before work aswell.

I have a lot of ideas for breed suitability but looking for insight from those with more experience with suitable breeds on what could be a good fit for me.  This is my first ever Reddit post so if there are any mistakes (e.g. formatting), that's why.  It was dictated to my American SO, hence the American spellings, if anyone was curious.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

*1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?*

First dog, grew up with nan‚Äôs red setters and a mix breed that I did a little training with. My mum had a Rottweiler until recently that I got to see/play with and do minimal training with when visiting. Partner has experience training obedience, trick work and distraction proofing, volunteer assisted at a training facility and was at one point registered as a therapy team with her Papillon. I know birds aren‚Äôt the same as dogs but I do also have experience training birds.

&amp;#x200B;

*2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a* [*reputable breeder*](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)*?*

I have a slight preference for going through a reputable breeder, ONLY IF the breeder is offering an unfixed male, due to the behavioral/physiological impact of neutering. However, I would be happy with any dog, rescue or otherwise, that could perform the tasks I need it to.

&amp;#x200B;

*3. Describe your ideal dog.*

Active, requiring at least around 2 hours a day of exercise (my tentative plan is a 1 hour run + obedience training in the morning, 1 hour of hands-on training e.g. agility/retrieving in the afternoon, and 1 hour plus or minus of light/moderate flexible exercise in the evening), robust/rough-and-tumble (something I can potentially roughhouse with/don‚Äôt have to worry about being gentle with), minimal breed health problems (I don‚Äôt want the health of the dog to be a concern I have to manage from birth to death), attentive but not anxious, emotionally robust, fairly calm (not easily excitable), a closely-bonded (ideally one-person dog) partner.

&amp;#x200B;

*4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?*

I‚Äôm open to any breed as the important part is that it‚Äôs fit for purpose, but these are the breeds I‚Äôve looked at:

* *New Zealand Huntaway* \- The dog I‚Äôm most curious about/interested in right now. I think a herding breed would be good at the tasks I need it to perform and I like that it‚Äôs pure working stock.
* *Standard Poodle* ‚Äì Intelligent, trainable, and athletic. I‚Äôm concerned they may be too emotionally sensitive and about the potential for health issues but am optimistic about their potential.
* *Airedale Terrier* \- Suggested below.  Concerned about stubbornness/trainability for a first time owner.
* *~~Malinois~~* ~~‚Äì I understand they have good drive, high energy levels, good biddability, and good health, but I am not sure these are the right way to go for me due to being so ‚Äòtightly wound.‚Äô~~ Decided these are a definite 'no'.
* *Kelpie* ‚Äì Again, great working ability that I feel could be redirected for the tasks I need. Good energy levels, etc. Maybe a little small.
* *Australian Cattle Dog (working)* \- My favorite breed for years both aesthetically and in temperament, but for my needs I think they are too small and it is hard to find a relatively local breeder that doesn‚Äôt have very bullyish looking ACDs. If I could find something that was like a large ACD that could be perfect.

The breeds/types I‚Äôm drawn to aesthetically are primitive breeds, moderate working type dogs, lean dogs, and dogs with big teeth (not for any aggression reasons, just aesthetically I like a good smile), however aesthetic preferences will always come second to a dog that‚Äôs fit for purpose ‚Äì I will love it either way.

&amp;#x200B;

*5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?*

Essentially I am looking to self-train a service dog although as I live in the UK it will not be able to be registered as such and will not have the same public access rights as a registered or American service dog (I call it a task dog). I have severe ADHD and problems socializing that do not respond well to medication; as a result, I‚Äôm looking into ways to manage my life off medication. So I am looking for a dog to train to aid me in symptom management and reduction. Some of the tasks I‚Äôve identified are:

* Incentivizing me to both wake up and go to bed (probably by essentially harassing me)
* Finding and getting, particularly meds (for other medical conditions) but also many objects so I don‚Äôt have to be distracted from my work
* Behavioral interruption ‚Äì getting my attention to distract me from itching myself or getting agitated in public (potentially by grabbing my hand in its mouth and holding until released)
* Block/cover ‚Äì moving to stand in front of me and not letting me move, or moving to stand behind me and creating a barrier
* ‚ÄúStick and spot‚Äù ‚Äì physically blocking me from moving away from a location where I need to be (e.g. in the kitchen) until released

I‚Äôd also like to train it normal obedience commands, agility or something like dog parkour (I have done human parkour myself), and some fun tricks, because I have a lot of excess energy to constructively burn.

&amp;#x200B;

**Care Commitments**

*6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*

3 or so hours at least of one-on-one time, always at least an hour and a half of exercise and always at least an hour of obedience. I‚Äôm flexible.

&amp;#x200B;

*7. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?*

Always at least an hour of running a day, and probably at least an hour of additional fetch-type exercise. Potentially more if I‚Äôm not tired out by the exercise we‚Äôre doing. There‚Äôs a large potential the dog will be able to come with me to work even if it isn‚Äôt a registered service dog, however I won‚Äôt know for sure until next summer (I don‚Äôt intend to get a dog until I do know for sure). I intend to take the dog to parks where there will be other dogs, but not ‚Äòdog parks.‚Äô

&amp;#x200B;

*8. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?*

While I prefer a dog with an easily manageable coat, I‚Äôm happy to do basically all grooming at home, including for Poodle-type coats. I‚Äôm a big do-it-yourselfer and routine is important for me too, so incorporating grooming (including cleaning ears, brushing teeth, trimming nails, etc) into the routine could even be beneficial for me. I would be willing to pay a professional to do the things I wasn‚Äôt able to do but I would prefer to learn to do them myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Preferences**

*9. What size dog are you looking for?*

Medium to large ‚Äì it has to be large enough to block me effectively e.g. from crossing roads.

&amp;#x200B;

*10. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?*

Probably low to medium of all of these. I can handle shedding and slobbering and am happy to let a dog express itself by barking (volume doesn‚Äôt bother me), but excessive amounts of any of these would be distracting and thus not helpful for the purpose I need it for. A dog that lets out a big bark or two when it‚Äôs happy is A-OK, but a dog that chain-barks when it gets even a little excited would distract me, so I don‚Äôt want a breed predisposed to this.

&amp;#x200B;

*11. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?*

Important. I want to be able to take my dog to a park off leash and play games with it, as well as go running off leash most days. Additionally I need a high level of trust in my dog so even if it wasn‚Äôt going to be off leash in an unfenced area I would want to be able to trust that it would stay by my side.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

*12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?*

Low to medium snuggly ‚Äì I‚Äôm fine with a dog that likes to snuggle, but I want a dog that isn‚Äôt going to become a distraction (by trying to snuggle constantly) or be unfulfilled/unhappy when I can‚Äôt snuggle it all the time. Ideally I‚Äôd like a dog that was emotionally independent but liked a good scritch.

&amp;#x200B;

*13. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?*

I want a dog that‚Äôs independent enough to perform its tasks without a high degree of emotional encouragement to do them beyond what is received in daily obedience training ‚Äì it has to be self-confident and relatively self-possessed. However as I need a task dog that reliably performs tasks it does need to be attentive and have a good level of reliable obedience/responsibility.

&amp;#x200B;

*14. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?*

I‚Äôd like my dog to alert me to someone knocking on the door because I need an external motivator to prompt me to answer it. I don‚Äôt want my dog to greet strangers or visitors because I don‚Äôt want it to encourage people to interact with it (or me) while it‚Äôs working and I don‚Äôt want visitors or strangers to inadvertently un-train my dog.

&amp;#x200B;

*15. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?*

Generally yes but for my task dog no. It has to be reliable in public even if it doesn‚Äôt have legal access rights.

&amp;#x200B;

*16. Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?*

Begging for food. It is easy enough to train out but I don‚Äôt like it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lifestyle**

*17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?*

Pretty much never. Even if I can‚Äôt bring it to work with me my partner works from home and rarely goes out. I can‚Äôt imagine it being left alone for more than 3 hours at a time and that very rarely if at all.

&amp;#x200B;

*18. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?*

My partner will be helping me train this dog. She prefers small-to-medium, less active dogs for herself but has no trouble with large, active dogs being a part of the household. I‚Äôll be in charge of essentially all aspects of caring for the dog (feeding, walking, grooming, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

*19. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?*

My partner is planning on rescuing a dog suitable for her tastes (small-to-medium, less active, mixed breed) prior to adoption of this dog for me, and we would like to get birds (backyard hens, potentially budgies or doves) and a cat in the future (post adoption of this dog for me).

&amp;#x200B;

*20. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?*

No.

&amp;#x200B;

*21. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?*

Currently we are not allowed any pets (this is all research for 6 months from now when we move!). We will be ensuring the place we move into accepts whatever breed of dog we determine is best.

&amp;#x200B;

*22. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?*

We live in the UK, so no APBT, Tosa Inu, Dogo Argentino, or Fila Brasiliero.

&amp;#x200B;

*23. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?*

According to Google the average is 22-23 C in the summer and 8-9 C in the winter. There‚Äôs days where it goes up to 28ish or down to 0ish, but those aren‚Äôt the average. We get a lot of rain though."

 The last 2 months or so, she crunches down on the wood chips outside sporadically. She always stops when I tell her, but I can't be watching her every second for 10 hours when there's 25 other dogs there. She's started doing it so much that she has trouble pooping the next day. I'm getting worried about what she's doing to her stomach and intestines. 

Other dogs have done this here before; all have either chewed them and spit them out, or we feed them lunch halfway through the day and the behaviour stops. I started feeding her lunch last month, but she still does it. 

She doesn't have destructive behaviours at home - never gets into ripping or chewing anything up - but she's the only dog at home and has space to play with he own toys regularly.

Anyone have anything similar to this, or any ideas on how to make her stop? A good third of the play yard is covered in wood chips, and due to my shifts, she ends up being out there for a minimum of 5 hours each time she comes.

Harley is a bulldog mix we rescued about 2.5 months ago. About 2 weeks after getting her she started throwing up and subsequently having trouble breathing. We did xrays and she was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. She seemed to be fully recovered and completely healthy up until a couple of days ago. We picked her up from boarding/day care and she seemed fine, just a little tired. The next day we noticed she had a little bit of a runny nose and decided to keep am eye on it. That was Friday. Yesterday she still had a runny nose and a slight cough but she was eating/drinking normally and playing with her toys. We thought we'd give it one more day and then take her in. Welp, I wish I hadn't. I was up all night with her because she was struggling to breathe, vomiting and just uncomfortable. Took her to an emergency vet around 2am but they had a 2 hr wait and said she looked stable enough to go home. We went to our normal vet at 9am and they listened to her breathing and recommended the same course of treatment as the last time.

She lived a full and happy life, most people I encountered were amazed by her liveliness given her advanced age. Sadly, in the last few weeks her condition deteriorated, she had trouble orienting herself in the house, had to be fed by hand and hadn't been taken for a proper walk in months due to her fading endurance. Today we had to call the vet and we already knew it would probably not be a favourable prognosis. As we anticipated, the vet recommended we euthanise her, as there was no other solution that could have made her life easier. Of course, I knew this day would come eventually and had started preparing myself psychologically for her passing, or so I thought. The vet came to our home, to ensure that she would be relaxed in an environment she knows, but saying goodbye must have been the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life. She fell asleep forever surrounded by her family, ourselves and our three other dogs.

She was our first dog, my parents got her around the same time I was born and she had been my life companion ever since.

870,[HELP] How to figure out the right breed for my family?,dogs,t3_aay4dh,4,False,False,aay4dh,"Hi! I‚Äôm new to this sub, so let me know if this post is inappropriate.  
  
I have been a dog owner before, I had a standard sized Dachshund that lived 14 years and passed 5 years ago. Since he was my first dog, I did some mistakes while raising him, but in the end I think he had a happy life.  
  
Now I want very much to have another dog, but I am not sure if my current lifestyle would match a specific breed, or if I shouldn‚Äôt have any dog at all. I am 25, single and not planning to move or get married/have children on the next 7 years.   
  
First of all, I work from 9am to 6pm. I am able to walk the dog for 20 - 30 minutes twice a day (before and after work) and play indoors at night. I‚Äôm just worried about those 9 hours I won‚Äôt be home. We have a maid 3x a week that stays from 9am to 5pm, but she can‚Äôt give a dog full attention and walk him (unless we give her an extra pay for that). I can definitely take the dog to the city‚Äôs parks in the weekends.  
  
My family is not big, I live with my parents (60 y.o.) and a cousin (22 y.o.). My brother (22 y.o.) is there for the weekends, too. We live in a big apartment downtown and we are soon moving to a house with backyard in a quieter area. My parents are retiring soon (mom probably in 2019 or 2020).  
  
Regardless of my lifestyle, my favorites breeds are (a bit random):  
‚Ä¢ Welsh Corgi Pembroke  
‚Ä¢ Shetland Sheepdog  
‚Ä¢ Shiba Inu  
‚Ä¢ Samoyed  
‚Ä¢ Australian Shepherd  
‚Ä¢ Boston Terrier  
‚Ä¢ English Springer Spaniel  
‚Ä¢ French Bulldog  
‚Ä¢ Labrador Retriever  
‚Ä¢ Basset Hound  
‚Ä¢ Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  
‚Ä¢ Irish Setter  
  
We need a dog that is friendly towards people and other dogs, loyal and affectionate - not a lap dog though, it can be a bit more independent. I prefer small or medium sized (although some of my list are bigger). Do you think it‚Äôs feasible to have a dog under those terms or should I wait more for the right moment?

875,"[Fluff] So Much Personality, And Too Smart For Her Own Good!",dogs,t3_aatlv7,0,False,False,aatlv7," 

I work in a store that allows dogs to come in, as long as they're well behaved and either in the owner's arms at all times, or on a leash.

As I'm ringing up a woman, her dog manages to ninja her leash free of her distracted human, and comes around the counter to say hi.

I am first aware of this by the feel of something warm press against my leg. I look down, and there's this american bulldog mix pressing her side against my thigh, looking back over her shoulder at me, with her tongue hanging sideways out of her mouth. Her tail makes a very noisy 'thwack thwack' noise against the stuff behind the counter; the epitome of doggie language for, ""Hello human, I'm friendly, please pet me?""

I laugh and greet her, and her human is apologetic but I laugh it off and give ""Tasha' a petting, receiving kisses in return.

I ask if she'd be okay with a treat. (We ask because maybe the dog is on a diet, or has food allergies, or anything else that might mean treats aren't allowed.)

When I get the okay, I get a Milkbone out of the box and feed it to the happy hound before leading her back to her owner and finish up the transaction.

Just as her owner turns around to discover that the dog has ninja'd her way free once again... I hear a rummaging sound behind me.

I turn and see that Tasha is a very smart dog. That one box has goodies in it, and she has taken it upon herself to snag two for the road.

&gt;""Tasha!"" her owner scolds.

I'm trying very hard not to laugh hysterically as the dog turns around with the biggest, most innocent, Disney eyes I've ever seen, the ends of two Milkbones sticking out of her muzzle.

&gt;""Me? Steal cookies? Why would you ever think that of me?"" the eyes seem to say.  
&gt;  
&gt;""She's a bit too smart for her own good,"" I say, ""Keep a close eye on this one.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""So I see,"" her owner chuckles, and heads out with the leash firmly in her hand.

I hope her owner does a better job of keeping her dog in hand, but I have to admit, those shenanigans were funny!"

879,[Help] my dog won't sleep alone,dogs,t3_aav3rg,5,False,False,aav3rg,"Hello, 

I've had a rescue dog for almost two years and never had any problems with her, she settled in fine and was never any trouble. 

From the first night she slept downstairs in her bed and stayed there the whole night without any issues. A few months back we all went to bed as normal, however she woke up and started to bark and whine, so I went down and put her back to bed, I went back to bed but she did the same thing again. In the end I slept downstairs with her and she stayed and she stayed in her own bed whilst I slept on the sofa. 

She was fine for a couple of weeks after but then she did the same thing and I slept downstairs again, no issues. She then started doing this more regularly (once or twice a week). There was one time where when I came downstairs and opened the door she darted through and upstairs to my bed. I could not get her out at all. I was extremely poorly and just wanted to sleep so let her stay...I know I'm an idiot! 

After this night I went down and I would put her to bed and go back to bed myself but she'd continuously whine and bark (I must have tried 20 times each night) but eventually I gave up and let her up.

Now, every damn night she'll bark and whine until she's let upstairs to sleep in bed.

Please someone give me some advice!"
880,[Help] How to train a puppy to be polite while off-leash?? Super embarrassing situation yesterday..,dogs,t3_aaya8t,10,False,False,aaya8t,"I have a 4.5 month old mixed breed puppy (40lbs currently) and live very close to a super nice off leash area. It's like a combo walking path/dog area that is completely unfenced and connects to over 100km of trails, so there are dog people as well as joggers/cyclists etc. Now that puppy has all of her shots, I have been taking her out around the neighborhood and yesterday we practiced recall in the off leash area. I plan on taking her out there almost daily as long as weather permits so I really need her to learn to do this well.

The problem is, she loves everyone and right now wants to greet every single dog and person she meets. I don't let  her greet anyone when she's on her leash, but all of the socialization we did before her vaccines were done seems to have accidentally taught her that if she's off-leash she can run up to everyone she sees and go wild. She met friends' adult dogs at our house and theirs (off leash the whole time), and did a 6 week puppy class that was a combination of training on-leash and then taking the leash off and telling her to ""go play"" before letting the puppies run wild and play with each other, in addition to another socialization session with 8-10 puppies once a week. Again, off leash = party time to play and greet other people and dogs.

Which leads us to what happened yesterday. About 5 minutes after I let her off leash (so she still had the puppy crazies), a woman came walking up the path from around the corner and my puppy BOLTED right towards her and didn't hear me calling for her at all. She jumped up on this poor woman and snagged her gloves with her teeth and ripped them while trying to play. After about a million apologies and re-leashing the puppy until we were out of sight of any other people, we continued our walk and she was fine with recall, but it was bad to say the least.

How can we train her to leave other people/dogs alone unless I say it's ok? I am at a loss here, especially when it's an off leash area and I can't control her like I'd be able to on-leash?

881,[Help] Dog resource guarding and infants,dogs,t3_aaxv3o,2,False,False,aaxv3o,"Hope this is the right place to post for help, if not please let me know where to go!

I have a 6 year old Shetland Sheepdog/Shihtzu mix. She's been an only dog the whole time, though we visit family with dogs regularly.
I have a 9 month old who just started crawling and naturally wants to touch the dog's toys and food. 
Dog is doing pretty good so far, she takes the toys and runs across the room to  keep them away from the baby, but she does growl when she does it. 
She also growls and eats her food as fast as she can when the baby starts crawling near it. 
She doesn't care about stuffed animals, but higher value treats or treat dispensing toys cause the growling and defensive body language.

What we've done so far:
-We do not yell or scold. I don't want to encourage aggression by being aggressive.
-The dog has her own kennel and couch that are off limits to the baby. 
-we limit the toys out laying around, if she's chewing on one and the baby grabs a different one it stresses dog out.
-I've been giving dog high value treats when the baby is by the food and water bowls, and now she tolerates the baby by the bowls if they are empty.

Dog has never snapped at anyone and I can take even high value treats away without problems. But I really don't like the growling at the baby.  What can I do to help her with the baby? 

I really appreciate the advice!"

884,"[DISCUSSION] For the love of all things good, please LEASH YOUR DOG.",dogs,t3_aaq7g3,38,False,False,aaq7g3,"Today I just about lost my mind. My neighborhood is notorious for unleashed dogs just trotting around on the sidewalk while their owners give 0 shits about their own dog's safety or anyone else's. I've had dogs bolt across a busy street, trying to attack my dog. I've had dogs run down an entire block, owner making no effort to catch them, to get closer to my dog. 

Today, I round the corner with my girl and see a small, white, fluff ball with no collar or leash. I shorten my girl's leash and turn right the fuck around - I do not deal with off leash dogs. This woman and her free fluffball round the corner right after us and her dog sees my girl, starts walking towards her, and then the woman looks at my girl, says ""oh. no."" like my dog is a disgusting beast, and proceeds to pick her dog up right in front of my girl's face. Clearly this worked my dog up, and this woman's response was to laugh and give another, ""yeah..no.""

I'm so fed up by how many encounters I have with off leash dogs on a WEEKLY basis. Leash laws exist for a REASON. I don't care if your dog is friendly. I don't care how well trained you think your dog is. I don't care about any reason you think having your dog off leash is okay. Unless you're at a park that permits off leash dogs, PUT A LEASH ON IT. 

Lastly, why is it always the owners of these small breed dogs that do this? I've never seen a Shepherd, Lab, or Pitbull walking around on a sidewalk without a leash. But you bet your ass I've seen plenty of poms, shih tzus, and other fluffy mutts trotting around with nothing attached to them. Someone please tell me why that is - I genuinely don't understand. 

If you're reading this and you got a dog for the holidays - buy a leash and use, I beg you."

My grandmother is the worst human being on the planet because she is so fucking stubborn. I am actively looking forward to her death. Just a preface.

I have a 9 year old Shih Tzu. We got him when he was 2 months old. He's a very energetic dog, super friendly and intelligent, though stubborn himself. My mother and I work full time at different shifts, so for most of the day, the dog is alone with my grandmother. I come home pretty late and therefore wake up late, my mother leaves very early. So let's say from like 10 am to 5pm, the dog is 100% alone with my grandmother. My grandmother feeds him treats and human food only. My dog is almost obese. Anyway. My grandmother was away for 2 weeks and the dog ate his food every day. Every single day. The day she came back, he hasn't touched his bowl. He doesn't care, he's getting fucking treats! I come home from work today, and just now I found three treats on the stairs. Fucking three. On the stairs. And I know she kicks some under her bed, and I know she feeds the dog her food, when she eats (she ""accidentally"" drops stuff on the floor and he eats it). And we don't eat healthy ourselves!

I have told my grandmother to stop. She doesn't. I asked my mother to tell her to stop. I don't think my mother ever really did. And now I am so damn angry and I'm crying every fucking time I see my dog just not getting a healthy diet. We're all overweight and really unhealthy in this family but I tried my damn best to get my dog the best food even if it's fucking expensive and she's ruining it all by giving him only treats and human food.

I want to give the dog away, to people who will take care of his physical health and love him and respect him, but I'm afraid that it will be traumatizing to him. He's been with us pretty much his whole life, and he does love my grandmother. But she's ruining his health. He's almost 9 years old and for the past like 2 years he can spend months not eating his food. I am worried for him. But what is wise to do in this situation?

We scheduled a catscan to find out if surgery will be a feasible option or not, soonest they could do is still 5 days out.  He was good for about 5 days after the chest tap, but is starting to show symptoms again.

&amp;nbsp;  
  
Last night we visited the neighbor and surprisingly the old pup was outside his front door sleeping on a blanket. Up to that point we were still trying to determine whether it was a good idea for us to take him. Once we saw the dog's condition up close we decided right then and there (warning: not for sensitive souls): https://imgur.com/a/5F5KZrD

Keep in mind that my neighbor was home at the time. We were furious but we needed to get the surrender form signed so we restrained ourselves. After a very short conversation (we found out his name is Chico) this asshole neighbor signed the form and we brought Chico to our car. We had blankets and the heater on blast for him. He was scared but immediately calmed down when we started petting and soothing him.

Once we got home we set up a pen in our kitchen, with lots of blankets, space heater, and a bed for him to rest. He started snoring. It's weird but that was incredibly gratifying. A few pics of Chico peeking up at me, then being a snoozeberry, and also our two other dogs Kulfi and Bonnie being curious: https://imgur.com/a/sV8FQ8Q  

Later in the night we found that the dog's condition was pretty bad. I had details here earlier but suffice it to say that we discovered he was suffering from debilitating neurological and physical issues. Chico is a tough doggy though. This morning we took him to the emergency vet. It now seemed that euthanization may be the most merciful option. The Banfield nurses were amazing and took us in immediately. They examined him, corroborated the neurological issues, and said that keeping him alive would be difficult and it wasn't clear that the dog was fully aware of his surroundings anymore.

So, we made the decision to give him the long sleep he badly needed. Chico was a sweet boy who deserved better. While I'm not really sure what I'm feeling right now, at the very least I'm happy that his last night here was spent indoors in a cozy bed with our other pups as his friends, instead of out in the cold. We gave him a big kiss and a hug and took one last photo of him snoring (again) at the vet's: https://imgur.com/a/d42oBTe

I plan on adopting a dog but I have no idea what I should look for. I don‚Äôt want the dog to be too large. Should I get an older dog or a puppy? What about breeds?

Any advice would be lovely üòÄ"
899,[Help] [Breed] Do German Shepherds commonly have fluff/hair behind their ears?,dogs,t3_aarltw,4,False,False,aarltw,"I have a 2 year old female German Shepherd and she has fluff/hair behind her ears. Many shepherds have a tad bit of fluff behind their ears, but my dog's is a considerable amount longer than other dogs. It is also matted in some places. I have not seen lots of ear fluff on many other shepherds, so it could be some sort of genetic thing, but I am not sure. She also looks a little different than most shepherds I have seen, so maybe she could be a similar breed like a Shiloh Shepherd? If this is not like German Shepherds in general, I would greatly appreciate any advice on a possible breed or strain. \[Breed\] \[Help\]"
900,[Help] Cockapoo destroying house &amp; misbehaving,dogs,t3_aarkxc,7,False,False,aarkxc,"My friend has a cockapoo - less than 1y old, female not spayed.
Recently, she has had to take on a busier working schedule, going from working 2 days per week to 5 and due to a recent leg injury (friend‚Äôs leg, not pup‚Äôs) isn‚Äôt massively able to take the dog out for walks. 

The dog has started misbehaving - she has ripped up half the kitchen floor, she whines all the time it‚Äôs left alone (behind the baby gate in the kitchen etc. with people within eyesight in the living room) and she HATES going outside to use the toilet. Every time the back door is opened, the dog backs into a corner and most of the time starts to wee inside. 

She‚Äôs got enough toys to be playing with, she gets attention. When she‚Äôs in the living room it‚Äôs manic - constantly playing, being bitey (playfully) you know, as dogs do but non-stop.  She doesn‚Äôt rest! Every time she‚Äôs placed outside she‚Äôs running and jumping against the back door and whining. 

My friend loves the dog, but as an older woman is struggling with how much stress the dog is putting her under. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to curb the antisocial behaviour/stop the weeing inside etc? It‚Äôs like she has attachment issues - can‚Äôt stop being the centre of attention. 

Also, if anyone can recommend any dog pens (the style without the roof) with a bottom tray about 150w x 120l x 90h in the UK to stop it from chewing through the rest of the kitchen floor?

Thanks very much in advance

903,[Discussion] [Vent] Don‚Äôt trust a shelter dog,dogs,t3_aaz58l,9,False,False,aaz58l,"Disclaimer 1: This is a very sad post with no happy ending. I‚Äôm using my throwaway because it probably won‚Äôt go over well with most people. 

Disclaimer 2: This is not an anti-adoption or breed discrimination post. Rescuing dogs of all sizes and breeds is amazing and wonderful. Just be careful with your choices. 

3 days ago, my mom decided my grandpa‚Äôs 80 lb farm dog needed a friend. She went to the shelter to get a puppy, but it had already been adopted. So instead, she finds another 80 lb, 8 month old mix breed dog. 

He was very sweet. Played great with other dogs. Loved people. And showed no interest in or aggression towards our livestock (horses and cows). So awesome! Looked like he was going to be a great fit. 

2 days ago, my husband notices the dogs playing near the horses, but we didn‚Äôt think anything of it. We didn‚Äôt see or hear any of the horses in distress. 20 min later our neighbor knocks on my door. Despite the best efforts of our loyal donkey to protect the herd, the new dog had fatally attacked our beloved pony. A miniature horse named Nugget. My first horse, and our family pet. We had to put our Nugget down to stop his suffering. And we put the new dog down so he couldn‚Äôt hurt anything else. It was a tragic day. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. My husband and I could have stopped it if we had gone to see what the dogs were doing. My parents could have prevented it had they spent more time screening the dog for any aggressive behavior.  

We get these dogs with unknown history and temperaments. We know to check for the big stuff. Obvious aggression to other animals, food aggression, chasing livestock, etc., but we never thought that 1. He would be able to take down a 300 lb pony, and 2. That the donkey wouldn‚Äôt be able to chase him off. 

My heart is broken. But lesson learned the hard way. Don‚Äôt trust a dog you don‚Äôt know anything about until they prove they‚Äôre trustworthy. Don‚Äôt take a dog from the shelter or off the street and trust them to be safe around your other pets, children, elderly, etc. because you just can‚Äôt know within a few hours. It took this dog 24 hours to tear a hole in our family‚Äôs heart. And this one was just a pony, what if it had been a child?

904,[Help] My dog only likes great danes,dogs,t3_aatvk2,2,False,False,aatvk2,"I adopted my now 10 yr old pitbull 2 years ago and i believe he was not socialized before i got him.  I (naively) tried to socialize him and he had no social manners, which led to him being bitten in the face by another pitbull.  Since then, he has not liked other dogs.  He lives peaceably (mostly) with my other dog, his brother who is a beagle, but he has bitten my dog, my moms dog, and friends dogs.  He does not leave marks or cause injuries but it is not pleasant.  SO he has a muzzle on during all dog interactions except with his brother.  However, we met a great dane in the park and he actually played with him!  After two years to see my dog enjoying another dogs company was wonderful.  We run into them occasionally and he always is happy and wants to play.  This has carried over into other great danes he met, and SOME large dogs.  I think it is enormously therapeutic for him.  The great dane owners I have met have been patient, but obviously want to not arrange purposely to meet my dog.  How in the hell do I find him a Great Dane friend?  I would pay but I don't know where to begin to find something like this.  I live in NYC."

907,[HELP] Dog bit at dog park,dogs,t3_aas2en,12,False,False,aas2en,"My dog is extremely friendly and around 8 months 40lbs. Hes a Amerrican Stafford Terrier and a rescue. I've had him about 1 month

Today at the dog park he was bit by a rottweiler after about 2 hours of playing at the park. The rottweiler was a new arrival and thermacules indulged in his regular play the dog without warning snapped and bit him on the hind leg.

The owner immediately screamed no then hurriedly took his dog back to his car and fled.

I cleaned the wound and put AD ointment on it. It doesnt seem deep seems superficial. Red ish like if you fell on concrete (human) but no leaking blood..
Should I take additional steps? I wrapped it and hes acting fine but I just want to make sure. Probably more experienced people on here.

About 10-15 minutes after an episode and he's basically his normal self. He'll run and chomp his toys, and flop on them as normal. 

Saw vet, got Xrays(bone structure looks normal) , got some meds, but he's still having the episodes and it breaks my heart every time. Also noticed that the paw he limps on feels cold during/just after an episode.

Anyone have experience in making their dog feel better during these sort of things? He looks so terrified and I don't know how to reassure him when they keep happening."
