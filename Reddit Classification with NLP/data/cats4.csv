Minifig here. I've been running this place pretty much solo for the past two years. (I know, insane... right?) That means I've taken care of all the reports, all of the mourning/loss flares, all the bans, etc for almost two years. Alone.

Because of this, I need a tiny bit of a break, and with this, I've demodded the mods who haven't done anything. 

With this, I need to hire up a whole new lot of mods who are willing to mod this subreddit.

Things I need to know:

Your Age.

Your Timezone:

If you're okay with the allowing posters to post their kitties they've lost/posting kitties that have crossed the rainbow bridge.

What things you think we could change for the better of the subreddit.

Lastly; Why do you want to help run this subreddit?



Our latest mod recruit BasX can tell you that I'm completely serious about modding new faces. They sent me a message, and a few days later they were modded. 

Again, there's no rush on this, but if you want to be considered, please reply to this post, privately to me, or if you've got loads of courage (or are high on catnip...) reply to this post and I'll look it over and get back to you.

&lt;3,

Minifig"

We love him so much and he‚Äôs a great addition to our lives!  We‚Äôre moving out of our apartment in June (2019) hopefully getting a bigger place or a house. I often think about getting another cat if we have the space. Our current little one is a boy about 7 months old, pretty friendly with strangers and our other roommates. He can get bitey sometimes but he‚Äôs a good boy. I was wondering if anyone has advice on how to 1. Introduce a new cat to him. (He kind of flipped when he was approached by our buddy‚Äôs dog one time). 2. If I should get a cat his age/ sex or if I should get a kitten. I am just slightly nervous about getting another cat and it not working out because I would be so heartbroken if we couldn‚Äôt keep them both. 
I appreciate any advice!! Also Happy New Year!!"

My wonderful cat Snigglemittens is getting older but seems unchanged except for a bit of stiffness in his hind legs, which I've remedied somewhat with glucosamine.

I'd like to know what to watch out for as he ages so that he can grow older comfortably and so I can catch any age-related ailments early if I can. Also if there's anything preventative I can start doing now to extend his health. 


Here is my tubby man, he's been on a diet and has lost a few pounds so he's less tubby now than in this picture

Our male is not aggressive. He‚Äôs very chilled out. He‚Äôll actually let you pet his belly for as long as you want. And I think he may just want to play with our female, but several times a day you‚Äôll hear the male chasing the female, lots of panicked hissing from the female, and then inevitably, shrieks and screams from the female with the male on top of her.

Is there any way to keep the male from doing this to the female. The poor thing can‚Äôt walk across the room without being harassed. "

I have two lovely kitty snuggle butts but my males kitties pee was so strong smelling, even with scooping multiple times a day. It seemed like I was switching litter ever couple weeks trying to find something that would better handle the urine smell. Every litter that claimed to ""cover ammonia and urine smells for up to 7 days"" blahblah. Anyway, I had been seeing pretty litter on basically every other Facebook ad and didnt think much of it till one of their ads was a video and the user mentioned it completely absorbed the urine and prevented the smell for nearly the entire month it is used. So since I was at my wits end with litters I was buying in store, I decided to test it out. OH MY GOSH, you literally can not smell the urine at all (until the beads get saturated towards the end of the month). I am finally not embarrassed about cat pee smell in my apartment, it is amazing. Though to be 100% fair I dont necessarily put merrit into the color changing (it happens but idk how accurate it would be), but for odor absorbing ability only, pretty litter is 100% worth the money. Just thought I'd let you follow cat lovers know, if you have the same cat pee smell problem."

Our cats have allergy issues and the food they tolerate best has been nulo (petsmart) brand turkey and duck flavor.

We like nulo though since the first few ingredients are meat, not grain.   

Does anyone have another high quality food they recommend, that comes in turkey or duck?   Oh yeah, and chunks are preferred....they hate pate so much (can you blame them?)

441,What‚Äôs the best way to care for a cat and a new kitten?,cats,t3_abimir,3,False,False,abimir,"Last year we took in a healthy male cat from a family friend who could no longer care for him. He has never been unwell so never needed a vet. We got rid of his fleas a few times but other than that he has been fine.

Recently, and unexpectedly our ‚Äòmale‚Äô cat gave birth to two kittens. One of the kittens died after around three weeks, but the other seems to be doing fine. The one who died was very small and frail and smelled quite bad, I‚Äôm guessing he had an infection. 

We now have one cat and one kitten that we need to care for and would like to know the best way to go about this. 

Should I buy a pet plan from the vets or is it cheaper to just pay for appointments as they come? We really can‚Äôt afford to spend a lot on vets fees and so just want to know what our options are. 

Is it cheaper to buy worming tablets from a pet shop or just to let the vet handle everything? 

We only took on the grown cat as a favour to a friend but we really love him and would hate to give him up. We would also like to care for the new kitten as well as we can. 

The kitten has started eating slightly and can walk/ play so we think he is okay health wise. 

Any advice would be appreciated. 

Also we‚Äôre in the UK if that makes any difference to pet insurance/ vet costs. "

As it became cold she came inside a few days ago, eventually claiming our house and me as her own. We adore her. 

I treated her for fleas and took her to our vet to have her scanned for a chip and to subsequently get her shots if she was not. Sure enough, she was chipped and they took all my information and went away to contact the chip company. I was pleased with this, thinking that I would be able to find if she was a neighborhood outdoor cat or perhaps just lost and running with the ferals here. 

They took my name and phone number, told me the cat‚Äôs name, and I left without getting any other treatment for her, of course, until I could hear from the owner.

Several days later, nothing. I do not know if the people have moved and changed their number, don‚Äôt want to cat anymore, or are actively looking for her. 

I also have one neighbor who is particularly hateful and would not contact me even if my home were on fire, after an ugly court battle about something illegal going on on their property of which we were reluctantly involved in reporting. 
(Dear God, please, don‚Äôt let it be their cat for they have big dogs and act as if they hate cats.) 

What else can I do to establish who her rightful owners are while still protecting and feeding her during the winter weather? I would be glad to release her to anyone who loves her and will care for her, but if she is going to be left outside for coyote bait, I wish to protect her. She seems to adore me and doesn‚Äôt wish to leave my lap now. 

All I know of her is that she was running with the feral population over at least the last three months, day and night, and in a recent snow storm was living under a shed nearby. 

I have checked all the lost and found in our area and have posted photos of her. Have checked all the nearby vets. 

Any other ideas as to what I should do next? I would love to keep her if she does not have a home anymore, but certainly don‚Äôt want to poach someone‚Äôs full time outdoor cat or a lost one."

The one peeing on the rug doesn't go outside much in winter time and the other one is only 5 months old so i won't let her outside untill the spring or summer. The male is gone the whole day and comes home when it's getting dark. He rarely uses the litterbox"

The worst part is that I feel so guilty about bringing her to the vet. All she could do was muster enough strength to claw and bite, then flop to the ground, too weak to move her back legs. She hated her final moments, but I guess all animals do. Definitely would've been more comfortable at home, but the cost to bring a vet to our home was too much. "

But over the years she's slowly developed some really troubling respritory problems. She's constantly sniffling which leads to sneezing and reverse sneezing. I can hear her struggle to breath when I lay down for bed. I've taken her to two different vets and they all say there's nothing obviously wrong with her. No pollyps, no infection.  

I've treated her with antibiotics, anti-herpes, anti-inflammatory, air purifier, humidifier, and tried to give her steroids but she spit those back up. The only thing that helps a little are these anti inflammatory drops which she hates, and they are a temporary fix anyway. Does anyone have any expirience with this, dealt with something similar? Could it be allergies? What could I do?

The vets said I could pay to have her put under and flush her sinus out but there's no garuntee that would work and its a lot of money. 

She's my baby and I hate to watch her suffer like this. "

my house is pretty big and the downstairs is cold, i don‚Äôt want her sleeping downstairs tonight. i tried to coax her into leaving but she hissed at me instead, i already figured she wasn‚Äôt happy to see me.

as a person who knows very little on how to care for a cat, im concerned. as of now she is still downstairs and if it was under the right circumstances, i would leave her alone until she is comfortable. i personally dont think i am confident enough to own a cat, as i am probably more intimidated by her than she is of me.

My boyfriend and I are moving from LA to Austin at the end of the month with our two cats. We‚Äôre planning on shipping our stuff out there and driving with the kits. This is our first time on a long car ride with the cats so I have a few questions for you more experienced cat travelers:

1. Do you leave food in the carrier with them or feed them at pit stops? We‚Äôre going for a 12 hour stretch one day and 8 the next day so it‚Äôd be a long time to go without food or water I think.
2. Poop - how to handle this?? We plan to bring litter for the hotel but what do we do on the way there?
3. My boyfriend thinks we should let the cats roam free in the car to make them more comfortable (they hate the carrier) but I think we should leave them in the carrier since it‚Äôs safer. What do you all think?
4. Our vet informed us Texas is the heart worm capital for cats so we‚Äôre getting them medication for that before we go. She mentioned a kitty cocktail for the road but doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be necessary. We‚Äôre leaning against using one too but might get it ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. Anyone have experience with these?

Their microchips are up to date and we‚Äôre getting them collars/tags for the road too so we‚Äôre good to go there.  Any advice is appreciated if there‚Äôs something we‚Äôre missing.  Cheers!

761,Incurable biting kitten,cats,t3_abde3a,6,False,False,abde3a,"Hi everyone 
We have a 2 months old boy, who has been with us since he was 2 weeks, we fed him with bottle and unfortunately he lost his mother(deceased).
Ever since he came in, we have this biting problem with him which does not allow us to ever caress him or touch him, sometimes after he played enough, he comes next to us and rests beside us but no purring is heard while we try to caress his head and after 4to5 second,  here comes the teeth. 
We tried playing with toys with him, abandoning him after biting, saying loud ""NO"", clapping hands, but non works at all!
It is so bothering that we began to think of ""getting rid of him""!
Even when we have nothing to do with him, and not trying to caress him, he jumps and bites the foot, even when we are sleeping. 
Any different ideas for solving this matter?"

What can I do?,cats,t3_ab94m2,4,False,False,ab94m2,"I've had one cat for a few years, and we decided to introduce another cat in our house - she is a little older than our current male cat. Both fixed/neutered. If he sees her, he will chase her and attack her around the house, or try to corner her and bite her. 

Sometimes they are fine, and will both lay in bed together, with no issues at all. Other times, he can't even look at her without attacking. 

The weird part is, a third cat already lives in the house, but stays in her room for the most part. My cat (the attacker) will go into her room and have zero issues with her. She will hiss at him sometimes, but they never actually fight.

It's been like this now for 4 months. We try to give them treats when they are playing nice, and break up the fights when we can. It's gotten so bad that we have to separate them at night when we are sleeping, and have lost a lot of sleep due to meowing or other issues.

Has anyone experienced this? Really causing a lot of stress for my wife and I.

Thanks."

We have 3 indoor only cats (oldest we‚Äôve had 14 years and youngest for 7 years) all spayed. We‚Äôve lived in this house for 3 years and have a 5 year old kid. Nothing has changed recently. 

When we moved in we saw some bathroom issues but couldn‚Äôt pinpoint which cat, but they went away after a couple weeks. Now, out of nowhere, we‚Äôre having ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù all the time. We still don‚Äôt know for sure which cat and there‚Äôs been no veterinary reason for these to keep happening. 

Mostly it‚Äôs on any of my clothes found on the floor, but that‚Äôs not exclusive - my kids clothes, dolls, couch pillows and even my kids toddler bed (mostly unused) have been victims of pee. Most notably, my husbands stuff has remained safe (except for rugs and pillows in his office that would only really have his smell on them). 

We bought another litter box the other night and added that in a separate room thinking that‚Äôs the issue but still keep finding pee. And they do it while we‚Äôre home we just can‚Äôt seem to catch which one it is. 

Thinking about trying the feline calming plug ins but looking for any and all advice! TIA! "

My older cat (3years) would go to his food bowl and my kitten immediately runs up to the bowl and moves him out of the way then begins to eat. The older cat would just back off and walk away :( it makes me so sad lol.  Not to mention, the kitten refuses to eat his kitten food that they gave him in the shelter. I‚Äôve caught this and put the kitten in another room with the door shut to let my older cat eat peacefully. It gets super ridiculous when the kitten is released from the room after the older is finished and immediately runs to the bowl to eat ferociously.  I try to put the food up but cats are acrobats obviously. 

I realize a feeding schedule should be put in place. What are some schedules you guys find effective and easy? 
I‚Äôve only had one cat in a household at a time so this is kind of new to me. It‚Äôs clear this kitten is too aggressive with food and I need to also tackle his resistance to his kitten food. I bought a different brand of kitten food as he probably is over it now that he‚Äôs a had a taste of adult food. -__- 
I should‚Äôve known to do this sooner but I didn‚Äôt expect this from a kitten and I also didn‚Äôt expect my older cat to be so submissive. 
They get along great but the food issue is bothering me to no end.

Since she's the first pet I've ever had I guess I'm a bit extra cautious with her and spoil her a little bit. I don't feed her friskies or any of the cheap stuff. I get her lots of toys and play with her every day. I make sure to keep toxic things away and only use sprays and other things that are safe around pets (febreze one is a good one).

Now I'm growing a beard and want to maintain it with beard oils. I know that essential oils are hella toxic to cats and possibly dogs, and I want to be careful.

I was thinking about https://www.amazon.com/BEST-DEAL-Beard-Oil-Conditioner/dp/B078K36RQ1/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546290559&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=beard%2Boil&amp;th=1

which has Argan oil and Jojoba oils. I'm not sure if these are safe to use around cats.

I only plan to use a couple drops or so as my beard isn't large at all, but if I pick her up or she comes near my face, I don't want her to get contacted with it and potentially sick.

Are these items safe to use?"

I visited the local vet, without her, to get ear drops. The vet was examining a cat which apparently was suffering from Panleukopenia. He checked its eyes and its temperature via the rectum. Later he handed over the drops and change to me, all of this without wearing gloves.

I came home to my cat when we played for a while during which she bit my hand. I'm panicking reading about Panleukopenia and how it spreads. What are the chances she's exposed to the virus? I will get her vaccinated the first thing tomorrow, is that enough to prevent any complications?

Any help would be appreciated, thanks."
842,At-home euthanasia: learn from my mistakes,cats,t3_abb5us,4,False,False,abb5us,"I had to put down my best girl this week, and I royally screwed it up. I'm sharing in hopes that other cats will benefit from my idiocy. Sorry for the lack of cat tax, but seeing her right now is too much for me to handle.

Peaches went downhill very fast the day after Christmas, her CRF escalating into hepatic lipidosis due to her lack of eating. I just couldn't get food in her, despite mixing in a phosphorus binder. I had a vet ready to go for Saturday, but I called her and moved it up to Thursday due to Peaches' obvious suffering.

While waiting for the vet to arrive, I did all the last-minute things I thought were appropriate: cuddles, singing her favorite song, and so on. What I did NOT do, stupidly, was take the phone off the hook. I live in the semi-rural outskirts of a small town. We cannot get cell service on my street, so I have a landline to ensure that I'm always available for my elderly parents.

Less than a minute into the sedative, the phone shrieks. Peaches startles. I freak out. It's my aunt, droning on the machine about needing help with a rotting windowsill, until it times out and cuts her off. Silence. A few minutes later, a hang-up call. I'm already snotting all over myself, holding Peaches, and can't make the calls stop.

A rational person would have asked the vet to grab a receiver and bring it to me, or have her take it off the hook herself, but I was completely operating on lizard brain and unable to make that decision. I just held Peaches and tried to pretend it wasn't happening.

Finally, after the meds were done and Peaches was gone, the vet stepped outside to give me a few minutes. I tried to gather the other two cats to see Peaches, so they would understand. The phone rang AGAIN while I had the youngest (Wyatt) in my arms, carrying him to see his sister. I let out a demonic shriek of rage, which sent Wyatt flying with claws extended, shredding my wrist. I picked up the phone in a fury and unleashed an emotional bomb on my husband's former boss, who did nothing to deserve it other than be the unlucky third caller during my cat's death. I have no doubt that I seriously damaged that relationship.

It's been five days and I cannot get this shitshow out of my head. I desperately wanted a calm, quiet, dignified death at home for Peaches, and instead it was a fucking circus. Please, learn from my stupidity. When it's time for your cat to go, prepare your house properly. Unplug the landline. Turn off the cell phone, the Alexa, all the tech. Tape cardboard over the doorbell. The universe wants to interrupt you. Do not let it."

The day after I posted this, I woke up and found the swelling was extremely reduced and she wasn't squinting near as much. I cancelled my vet appointment and my wife bought some cat eye drops from the pet store. 

We administered the drops, and though she fought, they didn't seem to cause her discomfort and she shortly resumed normal activity. 

The next day, all swelling was gone and she has been fine ever since. What I think happened, and I'm no vet so this is a guess, is that she had a weird stress flair up. She had been less than a week before, went under anesthesia, rode in the car (which she hates) stayed in a different room in a strange house (my in-laws') without our other cat. Once she settled into her new routine, she seemed perfectly fine and has not had any issue since. "
864,Oily spot on cats tail?,cats,t3_ab7cns,2,False,False,ab7cns,"My 3 year old neutered male (orange tabby) cat Felix has suddenly developed an oily spot on his tail slightly above where his tail and back meet. The spot is maybe 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and on the top side  of his tail. It's not excessively oily, but I noticed it when petting him. It doesn't seem to be bothering him at all, as he's not picking at it or overly grooming himself, and he lets me touch it without putting up a fight. There haven't been any changes in his disposition either. His litter mate Gomez does not have it, so there's that. I parted the fur and the skin looks fine and clear, maybe a little dark but I think it's just because his skin looks sightly darker on his tail than his body.
Anyone know what this might be?
I'll be calling my vet once they open but that's still a few hours away, and this is causing me some anxiety.

Minifig here. I've been running this place pretty much solo for the past two years. (I know, insane... right?) That means I've taken care of all the reports, all of the mourning/loss flares, all the bans, etc for almost two years. Alone.

Because of this, I need a tiny bit of a break, and with this, I've demodded the mods who haven't done anything. 

With this, I need to hire up a whole new lot of mods who are willing to mod this subreddit.

Things I need to know:

Your Age.

Your Timezone:

If you're okay with the allowing posters to post their kitties they've lost/posting kitties that have crossed the rainbow bridge.

What things you think we could change for the better of the subreddit.

Lastly; Why do you want to help run this subreddit?



Our latest mod recruit BasX can tell you that I'm completely serious about modding new faces. They sent me a message, and a few days later they were modded. 

Again, there's no rush on this, but if you want to be considered, please reply to this post, privately to me, or if you've got loads of courage (or are high on catnip...) reply to this post and I'll look it over and get back to you.
