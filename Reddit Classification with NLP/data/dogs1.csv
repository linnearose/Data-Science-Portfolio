It's about time we updated our demographic information since our subreddit--and Reddit in general--has changed so much since the last time we did this. I put together a Google survey. All answers are reported anonymously and we won't use the information for anything other than learning about the subreddit and making the subreddit better (and for fun stats like ""most popular dog name in /r/dogs""). It should take less than 10 minutes to complete, maybe a little longer if you have a lot of dogs. 

You'll be asked for the breed of your dog(s) and I added some mixes and non-AKC breeds to the list. The mixes and non-AKC breeds appear first. Scroll down for the AKC breeds listed in alphabetical order. 

Breeds not listed: 

* Mini vs Standard Poodle -- select Poodle

* Jack Russel Terrier --  select Parson Russell Terrier or Russell Terrier

* Catahoula -- added to the end of the list

* Afghan Hound -- added to the end of the list

* Pyrenean Mastiff -- added to the end of the list

* Some other purebred that isn't listed here - select ""other"" at the end of the list

Sorry, everyone. The list is kind of a nightmare to update.

3,[Discussion] My 11 year old golden retriever's grain-free diet related heart problem is better after 6 months of heart meds and taurine supplements!,dogs,t3_a86iko,64,False,False,a86iko,"Long Post Warning, but I think it’s worth posting about and want to be thorough!

*Note: I’m using the veterinarian’s exact diagnosis throughout this post, as she would email me all her notes every time we would go for a checkup.*

TLDR: My 11 year old golden retriever was diagnosed with congestive heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which turned out to be due to her life long grain free diet and the critically low levels of taurine it caused. After six months of medication, taurine supplements and swapping her to dog food that is not grain free, she now has a healthy heart and is off all of her medication and supplements! And, she's got more pep in her step then she's had in at least a year!

Edit: spelling

—

Our 11 year old golden retriever Lilly has been a happy and healthy gal her whole life,  say except for a rock swallowing incident when she was about 4 years old and a few bad earaches that turned out to be due to a thyroid problem that’s been managed by medication for a couple of years now.

These last 6 months, though, they have been pretty tough. After a few, what we thought were minor issues and a few vet visits, we were hoping we were yet again being overly cautious when we took Lilly back to the vet in June. She had been coughing, had lost a lot of weight even though she was eating (being picky but still eating, nonetheless) and just seemed off… Unfortunately, it turned out that we weren’t being overly cautious. Something was wrong and our vet wanted us to take Lilly to the local emergency/specialty clinic right away. We knew she had quite a bit of fluid around her heart, but by the end of the night the admitting ER vet was discussing everything from potential cancer to even putting her down. We decided the plan of action would be to drain the fluid and see what we were up against and go from there.

Here is the exact diagnosis from Lilly’s specialist, at the clinic:

*Based on today's evaluation, we have diagnosed Lilly with congestive heart failure secondary to a heart muscle disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM. In Lilly’s case, the degree of changes to the heart are severe, and congestive heart failure (retention of fluid) has developed. After diagnosis of heart failure due to this disease, the average survival is about 3 months, though some dogs do not respond well to therapy and some dogs live well for much longer times (even years).*

Three different medications (Lasix 50mg, Enalapril 10mg and Vetmedin 10mg)/ three pills, twice a day was what we were sent home with. That, and the best-worst-case scenario we could have got. It wasn’t cancer, and at least we could try to keep her feeling better, and pray for the best outcome. 3-6 months (which was average) left with her was not what we were wanting, but at least we wouldn’t have to put her down right away. We were going to enjoy whatever time we had left with her.

Next check up comes a few weeks later and this is where it gets interesting. (If you’ve hung in this long, keep going) Lilly had perked up and was doing well on her meds. Our doctor at the Specialty Clinic was pleased with how she’s doing, and we end up discussing Lilly’s diet- specifically if she was on a grain free diet. She was her whole life, up until about March 2018, and I only stopped the grain free diet because I thought she was getting picky in her old age, so I was trying anything to get her to eat… Here again is her specialist’s exact notes at this visit:

*Lilly’s case is very interesting in the fact that she has been on a grain free diet historically. As discussed today, there has been a trend in veterinary medicine with grain free diets and development of dilated cardiomyopathy, particularly in Golden Retrievers. Although the mechanism is not known as to why this is starting to occur, if low taurine is identified, supplementation with taurine would be recommended. With taurine deficiency related dilated cardiomyopathy, the prognosis may be improved with supplementation. We have sent taurine levels out today to investigate if supplementation is needed for Lilly.*

Here’s the thing- we had Lilly on a grain free diet because we thought that’s what we were “supposed” to do. Only the best for our girl, right? You’d have to be living under a rock to not see all of these grain-free pet food commercials. It seemed like the responsible thing a pet owner should do for their 4-legged companion, but after speaking with the specialist she suggested we stop feeding Lilly AND our other two year old golden retriever grain free food right away. She let me know that there’s not been any studies showing grain-free is any better than food with grain in it, and unless your dog has some sort of legit reason to not eat food with grain it in, there’s really no benefit from doing it.

When Lilly’s taurine level panel came back, it was pretty alarming. Normal range for a dog is 60-150 nmol/mL (whatever that means). Critical level is less than 40. Lilly was at a 15!

Specialist’s exact diagnosis:

*I am so happy to report that Lilly’s taurine levels came back at a critically low level, indicating that this may be the reason for the dilated cardiomyopathy. I would like to start supplementing her with 2000 mg twice daily of taurine and would like to recheck echocardiogram in 3 months. Typically in taurine-responsive DCM, we expect a generally longer prognosis than in idiopathic DCM and our best hope would be to able to reverse the cardiac changes and be able to wean the cardiac medications and just maintain on taurine. Lilly's grain-free diet has already been stopped (important as this has been recently implicated in possibly causing the taurine deficiency).*

6 pills in the morning and 6 pills in the evening, supplementing with taurine and taking 3 different medications for her heart. We got to celebrate her 11th birthday in July and she (along with our two year old) were absolutely loving their Kibbles ’n’ Bits!

Three months later Lilly went to her normal (amazing) vet, for her normal yearly check-up and things seemed pretty good! She was tolerating her meds well. We were happy. Normal vet was happy and after getting her check-up results, Specialist was happy. They told us to keep it up and we would check her again in 3 months.

Last week Lilly went in for that six month check up. I’m not going to lie, we were nervous. We had made peace knowing that if these test results did not come out the way we were hoping that we had 6 incredible months with Lilly, where we really got to love on her and learn from her, but we were praying for not just good results, but great results. Still, in the waiting room, I was nervous.

I couldn’t have possibly imagined how that visit would go, but miraculous is a great word to describe it! After 6 months of supplementing her with taurine and giving her the heart medications she wasn’t just doing good, she **is** doing great!!!

Her specialist’s exact diagnosis:

*We are beyond pleased to report that Lilly's echocardiogram is now normal, with the diet change, medications and taurine supplementation. Her cardiac ultrasound now shows a very normal heart. Therefore, we can discontinue her cardiac medications and taurine and continue her current diet. Her prognosis is now great and she does not have any residual evidence of heart disease. Wonderful news for sweet Lilly!!*

No more congestive heart failure!!! Our girl has a healthy heart and we are beside ourselves with joy and praise and thankfulness for answered prayers!

This has been a long post, but it’s been a long six months. As many of you surely know on this sub, there is now an FDA investigation into a potential connection between diet and cases of canine heart disease. The internet, like always, is fuuuuuuuull of opinions. I not only have an opinion but have first-hand experience, and it’s worth sharing. This happened to Lilly. This is not just a post on the internet now, my girl went through this.

&amp;#x200B;

I would bet that all of y’all on this sub love your dogs like we love ours and I want everyone to know what happened here. Maybe this will help someone else, if not about choosing what type of dog food to buy, then giving you something to consider if your dog is having these type of heart issues, then perhaps it would be worth getting a taurine panel ran. But, beyond this, don’t get caught up in the latest and greatest, just because everyone else is doing it. You got to do what is right for you. Sometimes that is high end, never-even-touched-a-kernel-of-a-grain dog food and sometimes it’s Kibbles ’n’ Bits.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry to ramble, but thanks for reading. If you have any questions, I'll be glad to try to answer as best that I can- if not tonight, I'll check back tomorrow and as needed.

Thanks for reading!"

5,[fluff] reading your RIP posts has made me a better dog parent.,dogs,t3_a84i47,8,False,False,a84i47,"I read the RIP posts often. I can only imagine the heart break that people feel when their beloved puppers passes. Inevitably it makes me feel like I should be spending more time with my dog, Clyde. He's 3 and a half and I hope that I have a lot of time left with him, but nothing is for sure. He is so sweet, and even though he's not my whole world, my wife and I are his whole world.  Not to say that I ever felt like a bad dog parent, but now when I'm home from work,  I play lots more tug of war, we go on much longer walks, and I spend a lot less time on my computer or watching TV. So, thank you. "
6,[Discussion] Couple from which we got our dog 2 years ago trying to invite themselves over. Extremely inappropriate or am I overreacting?,dogs,t3_a87n61,22,False,False,a87n61,"My partner and I got a mixed-breed puppy in March 2017. I emphasize mixed-breed to make clear we didn't get it from a breeder, this was just a middle-aged couple whose own dogs had had a ""happy accident"".

Now, when they came to hand over the puppy (we even paid for it, signed a contract etc.) the wife was quite emotional - cried, even. They have eight other dogs at home and Just got this litter of three - if it had been her way I'm sure she would have wanted to keep them too, but I suspect her husband had the last say. Since they came over to visit us to see if the pup would be getting a good home, they now knew our address. 

Since then, the lady has continuously attempted to contact us and arrange a visit several times per year. At one point, around our dog's first birthday, she called and asked if she can come over and bring him a toy. We said it's not a good idea. She said ""Oh but I'm in the neighborhood, it'll only be a few minutes!"". We said we're going to see family and are getting ready to leave. That was the end of it, or so we thought. 

My partner's sister came to pick us up and as we got into the car she said ""X was just here asking if I lived here and could let her into the building. I said I'm just waiting to pick you up and she flustered and said 'oh you must be Y's sister, you look so alike!' Then she gave me the present for Pup and left.""

So apparently she thought we were lying/hurried over regardless and was looking for a way to get in and catch us at home. I freaked out. But anyway, after that there was radio silence for a while and I thought she got the message that this isn't her dog anymore and she should back off. Until a few months back, when she tried to call my partner again, several times. Then texted him, asking if we could meet up. He didn't reply.

Yesterday we got a Christmas card from her, her husband and ""the doggies"". Nice gesture if it had come from anyone else, but for me personally now it just makes my blood boil. I'm having nightmares that this woman will somehow, some day, make her way into our building, knock on our door and kidnap our dog once we open. I'm overexaggerating, I know, but I am kinda angry, so forgive me.

7,[Vent] My cousin bought a yellow lab and literally never walks it,dogs,t3_a7ybfw,114,False,False,a7ybfw,"Need to rant a bit about shitty pet owners.

So I've come home to see the fam for xmas and today my aunt tells me that my cousin (SC for shitty cousin) never walks her lab puppy, not even once a week. SC is always working/going to uni/interning and isn't home most of the time, so she says she doesn't have the time to walk the puppy. The poor pup was shut in a cage for the majority of the day until she outgrew it, now she gets to roam around my cousin's bedroom (which is the apartment's living room) and the covered concrete courtyard... so \~40m2 of space with no sunlight. ALL DAY. EVERYDAY.

SC bought the puppy on a whim, never trains her (although she said she's trained the puppy to not need walks?!) and has no plan to spay the puppy because of the cost. I think the puppy has been taken out in total about 5 times and she's now about 8 months old.

I've just been pissed about this for the pass few hours and thinking about what I should say to SC when I next see her. Welcome to suggestions

EDIT: SC lives at her own place with two flatmates, doggo is locked out in the courtyard these days when nobody is home so that's where she does her business. SC can definitely afford vet bills/a dog walker, but doesn't want to fork out it seems. My aunt isn't her mum, so there's only so much she can do/say, SC is going on another 3 week holiday in 2 months and my aunt's already offered to dog sit for free.  She and my uncle loves dogs so the doggo will at least have some free air and walks with them.

I would help her rehome doggo in a second, I'm just don't think SC would want to part with her because she's cute, quiet and doesn't make too much of a mess. There's only so much I can do because I live overseas for work and I hardly come home. The ideal scenario is that SC steps up, I'm just afraid that she'll agree to everything I say, promise to do better, do jackshit in reality and I'm a 9 hr flight away do anything about it. "

10,"[Rip]Pepper, 1.5 year old mexican mutt",dogs,t3_a7zmws,29,False,False,a7zmws,"Dear Pepper,

I had been searching for a dog like you for months, and got lucky when a rescue agency immediately replied to my request to see you. Most places wouldn't even respond to me, as I have a normal job, and would be a single dog parent. I'm assuming most didn't think that was ideal, but I was allowed to come see you anyway.

I got you when I had finished working on the movie The Incredibles 2, and took a few days off to go [meet you](https://imgur.com/NctPube), fall in love with you, and take you home. I remember being so nervous, I didn't have a crate to put you in, and I didn't have a harness to keep you still while I was driving, but [you just sat there, watching the world go by, completely happy and perfect.](https://imgur.com/jM81rbH) I had never taken care of anything else on my own. I've almost always been alone, and you fixed that.

You adjusted to my life so fast. You didn't bark, you learned how to use the doggy door in a matter of days, and you were so easy to take care of. You had walks every day, by me and a dog walker, and you barely pulled, but you slammed on the brakes all the time to stop and sniff everything. You had so many beds, [a bed in every room](https://imgur.com/Tl89iVZ). So many treats. I put my heart into you and you always just gave me as much love as you could. [You would fall asleep on me](https://imgur.com/pcLVSqu), and I'll never forget how I would let a big sigh out before going to sleep and you would always do the same. Just a deep breath before bed. Just like me.

There were some tough times, you had a bad case of [puppy warts](https://imgur.com/Yzk1zS0) that scared the hell out of me. You got over that, and then had urinary issues, which pills fixed, and then allergies, which pills fixed, but of all things I wish I had known the state of your kidneys.

We did so many things together, so much of my time and life over the past 10 months has been dedicated to you. I made you [puzzles and toys](https://imgur.com/xLJ3YWo). I learned how to dremel your nails and clip your toe hairs. You hated this at first and would shake and tremble when put in the harness, but eventually [you got used to it](https://imgur.com/iUCxx1l) and I hope you realized it was necessary.

You always went wild [at the beach,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WYEeFiWUWg) and you loved all the other dogs. Never aggressive, but a little shy. I remember when we would go on hikes and you learned to [sit and wait for other dogs to come up to you, all on your own.](https://imgur.com/6MUac6M) You were perfect in so many ways and you learned tricks incredibly fast. You were such a good girl.

You learned [how to sneeze on command in a matter of minutes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgpTScP374s) You learned so much and could have learned so much more. The [list of tricks was constantly growing and you loved it.](https://imgur.com/cMsaC8L) 

You helped me meet a [wonderful and caring woman](https://imgur.com/2VTzppj) who was there for you until the end. She spent days with you. Took you on adventures. To dog parks, beaches, all over when I couldn't due to work, and taught you even more tricks. But you didn't always need attention and stimulation. You were content just [sitting in the sun.](https://imgur.com/SVkUOaI) You were so chill, and exactly what I wanted in a dog.

Only a month ago we [hopped in the truck](https://imgur.com/8facWri) and I took you to Tahoe to [see my parents for thanksgiving.](https://imgur.com/Srn6oOi) You got to see snow for the first time and [you absolutely loved it.](https://imgur.com/Zp7kjd4) This week we were supposed to go back there, you would have loved it, like you loved everything.

Heather took you to the beach last Tuesday while I was at work, and you [ran and ran for 3 hours straight.](https://imgur.com/KU9p08q) You probably had the time of your life. When we broke up, you seemed to slow down a little. You were less excitable, and I assumed it was because you missed Heather. But that night, after the beach, you woke me at 4am, yelping in my face. I pushed you away and couldn't figure out what was wrong, so you went to the vet the next day. They did xrays, and poked and prodded, and gave you pain killers. They assumed you strained yourself running around at the beach, and I believed you would get better with rest.

But then you started yelping and screaming whenever you had to get up. You trembled and shook. And I thought you were just being a wuss. I've had sore muscles, and you just suck it up! But it got harder and harder for you to get up off the ground. The vet saw you again and prescribed different pain killers. You had such a hard time this last week and I became so frustrated. I was so scared that I would have to deal with a dog that gets sick every 2 months. This last week I watched you slowly die and I was so selfish and scared. You wouldn't lay down because it was so hard to get up. You would just come by and stand next to me, and [put your head on me.](https://imgur.com/q4pSMSD)

I went out and got you new toys, food, treats, doggy bags, expecting you to power through and recover. But 2 days ago you started to lose your appetite. You would wake up and [stumble even more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmglkILRZtM) but then be completely [normal a few minutes later.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCBxVdjeeaw) I got so annoyed with all the accidents around the house. At 4am I tossed you outside because you started peeing on me. I wish I knew you were failing from the inside out. I was running on so little sleep, you woke me every 3 hours for days.

I took you to the neurologist yesterday to get an mri done because I wanted more than anything for you to get better. I never considered that your kidneys could have failed. They said it was congenital, and there was nothing I could do. I wish I could have shown you the love I had for you over the last week instead of assuming it was a small speed bump in your life. This last week was tough. I didn't know and I'm sorry. My house is so empty. Your toys are still everywhere, your beds, your leashes and harnesses. I only had you for 10 months, but I wanted to have you for as many years as I could. [I love you Pepper.](https://imgur.com/HbYfOCI)"

Yesterday, I brought home my first dog. I've fostered a lot of dogs in the past but this is my first time figuring out issues without a rescue backing me up. And boy howdy, she has some issues.

She's a 4 year old bulldog who is SEVERLY overweight, has next to zero social skills, and has lived up to this point in either a kennel or run. She has diarrhea, and was being fed probiotic pills like treats (they gave her 3 while I was talking to them). She was being kept outside and smelled so bad that I had to ride home with the windows cracked.

I've got an appointment set up with my vet for after Christmas. We stopped by the office to introduce her and make the appointment, and the main thing she was concerned with was her weight. She weighed in at around 67lbs.

So I need a little bit of advice.


How much should she be eating a day? Should I wean her down to a smaller amount slowly? She was being fed 2 cups of food, 3 times a day.


How fast should we increase our walks? She can almost make it around 1 city block before she starts getting tired right now.


My vet advised rice water and pumpkin for the upset tummy. How much of this should I offer her? How often? If this doesn't help, whats the next step until her appointment?


Do you have any tips for socializing her safely? Or anything else that I might find helpful?"
15,[Help] Does my aloof dog like paw massages?,dogs,t3_a8b1jm,2,False,False,a8b1jm,"She technically belongs to my parents. They adopted her as a puppy thinking she would be a small lab mix.

Aside from that she doesn’t show a lot of love for her people. We love her just the same. 

In the last few years we have noticed she does something kind of odd. When we’re sitting down she’ll paw at us pretty persistently. Again, she’s big so you can’t exactly ignore it either. We give her pets but  that doesn’t seem to be what she wants. Food is in her bowl so that’s not an issue. The only thing that seems to stop her is holding her paw and kind of squeezing it a bit...like a hand massage for her paw. Obviously she will stop (because her paw is in our hand) but she genuinely seems to enjoy it. When we stop, she’ll paw at us even more aggressively. 

Does my dog like paw massages? Is this totally weird or does anyone else’s dog like that? Is she trying to tell us something else?

I just have one small concern and curious question. Hopefully some of you can give me your opinion on this.

My dog has never shown any breathing problem and health problems in general and i'm surprised after knowing a lot of people have bad experience with this breed. After a tons of research they can get health problems and/or breathing complications as they get older.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Pictures of my dog here**](https://www.instagram.com/frenchie.shiva/?hl=en)

&amp;#x200B;

**I contacted my breeder and after looking at my dogs picture he said my dog looks fine with the nose she has.**

**All the times I went to the vet they said my dog doesn't need a surgery.**

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions are the following:**

*•Did you still have your dog have a Stenotic Nares and Soft Pallate surgery even though they look fine?*

*•Can my dog get breahting complications when she gets older even though she's doing fine now?*

&amp;#x200B;

I just want whats best for my dog and to be able to avoid complications.. one thing that my dog does a lot is Reverse Sneezing when she get super excited and agitated, not sure if its because there's not enough air flowing.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? thanks"
18,[discussion] Stop approaching my dog and petting him without asking first!,dogs,t3_a8067t,70,False,False,a8067t,"I recently adopted a 15 lb, 5 yr old shih tzu mix! He’s sweet as can be, and loves to be scratched.

What he and I don’t love is when random people approach us, and randomly start petting the dog without asking first. 

My dog does NOT like to be quickly approached by strangers, and WILL bark at you if you come at him too quickly. This gives people the notion that my dog is “mean” or “aggressive”. 

He’s nothing close to mean, he just hates being randomly approached with a hand in his face to pet him. 

Please ASK to pet my dog, I can’t stand people who don’t ask. Not only is it rude, you never know how my dog or anyone’s dog will react to you randomly petting it.

Anyone else have trouble with this? "
19,[DISCUSSION] Kids in dog parks,dogs,t3_a87rwu,9,False,False,a87rwu,"A few weeks ago I was at the dog park and a family with kids came into the park. Everyone went silent, and held their breath each time the kids would run up behind a random massive dog and pet it. The kids would run around screaming charging at all the dogs saying ""MOM A DOG ITS SO CUTE I WANT TO PET IT"". 

Once the family left everyone took a sigh of relief, glad it was all over and no one got hurt. 

Seriously, why don't parents teach kids how to respect/approach unfamiliar dogs? It seems neglectful to let their kids be in a position where they could get hurt. "
20,[Help] Luxating patella surgery in small dog,dogs,t3_a8a5jv,1,False,False,a8a5jv,"Hello,

I have a Maltese who's recently gone through Luxating patella surgery. She's about 3 weeks post op and tonight we noticed dark red marks appear on the inside of her leg, kinda like bruising. She's about 2.5 years and 4.5kg

She's been a nightmare to try and keep relaxed. She constantly wants to jump and run even in crate confinement. She's actually knocked over the pen we've been keeping her in while trying to escape. This was just 2 days after the cast came off

To be fair, she's calm for the majority of the time. For the most part she's just lying down relaxing. The problems come when the door bell or phone rings - she gets overly excited and jumps. 

Today, the doorbell rang and she jumped a few times. We picked her up to stop that and we noticed these marks appear on her leg. She has no (apparent) pain, she can still walk like she has been and it seems like nothing's wrong. 

She's going to the vet tomorrow (well, in 9 hours) but just for peace of mind, we're hoping it's just some bruising but we don't like that it happened right after jumping. 

Does anyone have experience with this surgery, and what could have happened to cause a bruise/internal bleeding like that? Keep in mind she seems absolutely normal like nothing's happened.

Thanks all"

23,[Breeds] Need help choosing a breed,dogs,t3_a88wql,3,False,False,a88wql,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I've never owned a dog before, but I have some experience looking after them. I've done a lot of research though, and will do more once I've decided on the breed.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Either is fine. I just want it to be the right one for me.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Loyal, intelligent but not too stubborn, quick to learn and quick to obey once trained.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Vizsla has always been dear to me, but from what I've heard, they're only sold to homes that hunt.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Advanced obedience, some agility as a hobby. Running off-leash so we can go hiking together.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2 hours on average.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours. Dog park a few times a week, hikes and swimming whenever possible (summers are short here), agility once a week and long walks daily. I don't have a yard though.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'll do the nail clipping and such myself as needed, but I prefer dogs with shorter hair that only needs to be brushed maybe once a week and are easy to keep clean and stink free.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium. I prefer bigger dogs, but they're not always good for apartments.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I can handle, slobber is a no-no. I want a breed that either barks very little, or can be trained to not bark.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Doesn't matter that much.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Preferably not by barking. Can either be friendly or aloof, but not aggressive.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Preferably not. Will have to get along with my sister's smaller dog, as they'll be spending a lot of time together.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* High prey drive. I don't want the dog going after my cats, or any wild life when off leash.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* There's always someone in the house, or I'll take the dog with me.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* No preference, walking and playing with the dog occasionally.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have two cats.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, whenever I'm visiting my family. The kids are old and respectful enough to handle dogs with care, but obviously can be loud and energetic.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Yes. No restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* No such laws.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Short, mild summers and long, cold winters (up to -30c). If the dog is averse to cold, I'll get a warm doggy coat for our walks.

We have two medium-size dogs, a five-year-old male Brittany spaniel/blue heeler mix and a female three-year-old pointer mix. I've done a lot of work with them individually on loose leash walking. And, one-on-one, they are pretty good. But it is hard to walk them together. One will see something and want to stop or mark or see another dog/person and want to interact. They also get a little competitive with who is in front of the other dog, and they react to other people/dogs/animals on the walk differently than if they were alone.

They are not small dogs, so it requires a lot of energy to keep them in check on a walk together. Any advice? I have been taking turns walking one in the morning and the other in the evening and swapping who goes when, but it takes a lot of time. And, always, always, the dog who is left home is upset. My husband can walk them both together, but he is able to keep them at a moderate jog -which minimizes chance for distraction--the whole time. I am not as fit.:-( Are there strategies for walking multiple dogs that are different from walking a single dog by your side?

28,[Discussion] Adoption process frustrations,dogs,t3_a8b5i9,2,False,False,a8b5i9,"We've been trying to adopt a dog for more than two months and are starting to get really frustrated.


Neither of us are first time pet-owners (we have cats, and have fostered dogs) and by all means our application doesn't seem to be the issue here. I don't know if it's just my luck, the rescue foundations near me, or the time of the year, but it seems that none of the rescue organizations care about responding back. I've been in touch with 3 organizations near me and 2 in other states and it takes days, sometimes weeks, to get any kind of information from them about a dog who I think might be a good fit and would like more information on. When they do end up responding it's usually a one-line unenthusiastic email about the questions I've asked with no interest in a follow-up, or the dog has already been adopted so I have to start the process all over again. Two shelters have said that they'll get back to me about another dog because they have my information and I've been through the application process and gotten approved, but then...nothing. Silence. I have to keep prodding to ask them to respond to my last email or phone call. I understand that people who work there are volunteers taking time out of their day to find the perfect home for these pups and are overwhlemed with all the responsibilities, but I'm getting so frustrated that I'm thinking of giving up.


I assumed working with a shelter or dog adoption agency would be easy but this process has been dragging on for way too long with what seems to be a one sided attempt at adoption. It seems I'm the only one who is excited and invested in giving a home to a dog. Is this normal and am I being a nuisance, or should I make more effort into getting in touch with the shelters/try my hand elsewhere? This is my first time adopting instead of fostering so I'm super confused why this is so incredibly different and difficult than fostering. Any advice would be really, really appreciated. Thank you!"
29,[Help] My dog has been having paw problems for over a year,dogs,t3_a8b28h,0,False,False,a8b28h,"My Febe is a Maltese, and she’ll be 11 in February. For the past year and a half she has developed a nasty habit of licking and sometimes gnawing at her paws. It’s not even a specific paw; she alternates between the four. Because of this, the fur on her paws start to thin and her skin gets dry, flaky, and generally inflamed. Sometimes she even chews them to the point of bleeding.
We’ve tried many things. This includes numerous visits to various vets, and for the most part they just brush it off as allergies, but it’s rare that they actually attempt to fix it. One vet gave us medicine to give to her daily, and it seemed to work for about a week before she started at it again.
We purchased lil booties for Febe to wear to prevent her from chewing, but they’re a little loose (she has tiny feets) so they always manage to slip off. 
My dad read somewhere online that it helps to give her a little spoon of coconut oil every day, and we’ve been doing that for about a week, but still no change. We’re also concerned about the coconut oil because you know how those home remedies can be. I don’t wanna make her sick.
I love my Febe more than anything in the world. I completely adore her and I’m worried! I don’t want her to be in pain. She just won’t stop chewing her paws.

We have never had any issues with them before, both my pets have had surgeries there and they have always handled all the issues well.
However my dog recently got a bath and a shave there as she got lots of gross stuff stuck in her fur, and she came back itchy and distressed.
She felt discomfort in one ear and had a few missing patches of fur, as well as a lot of redness around her face and her underbelly.
We didn’t think too much of it as we thought it was just from the gunk pulling on her fur before. However the next day we saw she had scratched her chest raw and had lots of dandruff-like bits all over her.
I was worried it was dermatitis or something like that so I immediately scheduled an appointment. They did blood tests and skin scrapes and when they came back, they said it was probably an allergic reaction to the bath they gave her and that I should just wash her again at home with a special shampoo they gave me. 
I thought they would apologise for not spotting the problem when we went to pick her up after her bath, or some form of compensation, like the shampoo on the house. Instead we got charged about €100 for the consultation.

34,[Help] Anyone have experience with tooth root abscesses?,dogs,t3_a87spk,4,False,False,a87spk,"Hi everyone, my 12 year old Chihuahua/Pom mix has had swelling under his eyes on and off for over a year now. His cheek would swell a little bit and then burst into a little pus mess. The first time it happened we figured it was just a bite from something? So we cleaned it up and it seemed to go back to normal. But now it seems his cheeks are always pus-y. 

So I looked it up and I believe it might be because his teeth are infected. I found that infected teeth can push against the dog's cheeks and cause the swelling followed by eventual burst with pus coming out. 

I'm pretty sure that is what my dog is suffering from but I'm not positive.  To be honest, it doesn't seem to bother him at all. He doesn't show signs of discomfort. We can pet his cheeks and head and he won't pull away. He still eats food normally. But it is pretty gross and I feel bad for him.

We are currently feeding our dogs Orijen (by Champion Petfoods) senior dog food which they have been eating since 2015 or possibly earlier.


In regards to heart disease... In 2017 the vet mentioned that my dog had a low-grade heart murmur. Fast forward to last month. She started coughing a bit and when we took her to the vet, we learned that she has a grade 3 heart murmur now and the radiograph shows an enlarged heart. She is currently on some heart medication. I believe one of the medications caused loss of appetite and heavy breathing but did resolve the coughing (Furosemide). She is on Vetmedin now and has regained her appetite and breathing normally!


As for diet... I recently learned two things:

1) The current FDA investigation about the potential connection between DCM and diet containing peas, lentils, other legume seeds, or potatoes

2) Orijen, which I always thought was a high-quality locally-made dog food (I'm from Canada), changed their formula and moved their plant to the US in early 2016 or late 2015. Based on some posts in this subreddit, apparently the new formula uses less meat and more peas/lentils/legumes for protein which I have noticed in the ingredients list.


I am not saying there is a connection between Orijen (by Champion Petfoods) and my dog's enlarged heart but I want to be safe than sorry and avoid those ingredients. (Though I have found some news articles about this brand and heart disease, i.e. https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/investigations/-we-were-in-tears-heart-disease-toxins-among-growing-fears-in-boutique-dog-foods)


Please recommend me a good dog food brand! I have been reading as much as possible on dog nutrition and there is so much misinformation out there still.

I have decided that I’m not going to take her with me when I move at first. I feel like I won’t be able to give her enough attention, as I’ll be stressed myself from moving to a new city AND starting a new job. 

I want to be able to get settled and then have her come so I can properly acclimate her. Also, I know she will freak out when we are trying to move everything into my new place. My parents have agreed to take care of her. 

It will only be about 3 months or so but I am so sad. I want what’s best for her but being apart from her for even a few days makes me cry. 

Am I doing the right thing? "

What should I have done?",dogs,t3_a88xao,10,False,False,a88xao," I was just walking my dog minding my own buisness when an older man came up to me and screamed in my face to ""pick up this damn dog shit."" Thing is, my dog pooped about 20 minutes earlier and I definitly picked it up, as I ALWAYS do. There's no way she took a poop where he claimed she did as my eyes are always glued on her and she takes foreeeever to find a good position to poop, so I would've definitly noticed. She didn't even pee, so I have no fucking idea how he thought she took a shit.   


I tried to reason with him like ""Oh sorry, you must be mistaken, my dog didn't poop, I would've picked it up. Sorry for the misunderstanding."" But he continued to scream in my face saying that he watched me and to pick up her damn shit. I said to him if he was so sure to please show me where it was and I'd gladly pick it up but he just continued to scream at me. I was seriously scared. What the hell should I pick up if she didn't poop????    


He went on about how he wants to kill all dogs and their owners and how disgusting we all are. I slowly took off in the other direction being scared shitless and not wanting to be screamed at any longer for something I didn't even do. What should I have done in a situation like this? What would you have done? Do I need to be afraid of the safety of my dog? Should I look for another route to walk from now on?"

A couple weeks ago a bump appeared on my dogs brow. in less than a week later it was the size (and feel) of a golf ball. We took her to the clinic and they prescribed antibiotics. However, it didn’t get any better, nor did it get worse. We took her back and they said not to worry that it was an infection and puss. Again, more antibiotics. 

Finally I decided to take her to the animal hospital (expensive but worth it) and turns out she has cancer. Her oncologist really explained the process and connected to my dog even though it was her first time with her ❤️ She didn’t immediately give us “the sleep talk” but rather explained options and customized treatments. 

although the treatments won’t rid her of cancer we want her to be happy and live her best life. She’s a happy baby, she isn’t in pain, and we are picking her up soon.

48,[Discussion] [Walk] [Tail] Why might a dog love taking walks but his tail doesn’t show it?,dogs,t3_a86cce,3,False,False,a86cce,"So I have an 8-year-old hound mix who my family and I rescued when he was 10 months old. He’s very anxious in general as he has undergone multiple surgeries as a puppy to ensure a healthier life as he grew up. 

My dog’s name is DJ. Every time I pick up the leash and collar, he goes NUTS (in a good way)! His tail wags uncontrollably, he runs to the door, and bursts to the sidewalk when I open it for him. 

He does what every normal dog does on our walks: He looks around, he sniffs the trees and what-not, he focuses his attention on nearby dogs. But for some reason, his tail usually doesn’t wag while we walk. I know he loves to walk because of his reaction before and after. But it seems like he’s just a little nervous while me and him walk. His tail isn’t COMPLETELY in between his legs, but his tail is typically down and somewhat hunched inward (sometimes - not always). It could be because he’s an anxious dog in general - He doesn’t like aggressive behavior from other dogs and he’s extremely gentle.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience about this. He’s an amazing dog - my best friend! It’s just weird. Why would he love walking, yet act anxious on the walks? This isn’t a serious concern as he’s been like this for as long as I’ve known him, but I’m new to reddit and wanted to see if anyone wants to talk about it. Thank you!"

52,[HELP] Advice for reducing barking,dogs,t3_a863kt,2,False,False,a863kt,"I just moved into a triplex and my dog barks every time someone comes into the building. I was trying to just call him to me with treats and make him sit in his kennel or come to me on the couch, but that has stopped working and he is barking with a lot more intensity than before. He no longer barks every single time someone comes in, but the times he does he is really barking, sometimes growling also. 

Honestly I think part of the problem is the people in my building seem to have a lot of short term ""guests"" who just come in the main door, go to their unit, knock and then leave again within 5-10 minutes. Some times they'll have people coming in and out like that for a couple hours. This also means that hes barking when they first come in the building, when they knock and then when they leave again and it is pretty disruptive. 

My neighbors have already complained to the landlord about the barking and I feel lost for what to do since a lot of the advice I see is to ignore it or call him to me but that's not working anymore. I'd really appreciate any other thoughts or advice. 
Thanks so much! "
53,[Help] My dog is obsessive and has severe seperation anxiety,dogs,t3_a87mbl,0,False,False,a87mbl,"I rescued my grandmother's dog, and she is roughly 10 yrs old.  We don't know anything about her past, but she has always had a rather fearful side to her which we believe could be from abuse based on how she reacts to certain movements.  I am only watching her temporarily, most likely for another month.
She has grown extremely attached to me to the point where I personally don't believe it is healthy.  She cries if I just go upstairs, she cries at night because she wants to sleep in my bed with me, she cries when I leave as well. When I am holding her she growls at my dad when he comes near.
She reacts very inwards towards others and becomes very stiff and alert.  She does not care to socialize at all with other dogs either. She also does not really know how to play. She just wants to be with me 24/7. It's one thing for her to be a lap dog but is it normal for a dog to be this obsessive? What can I do to help with her severe seperation anxiety? This issue has really put strains on my daily schedules as well as my sleep.
Many people say to just wait until I take her back home but she is not as happy when she is not with me and I want her to be able to live a happy life with my grandmother.  She does love my grandmother more than others but she is obsessed with me.

TLDR: My grandmothers dog has extreme seperation anxiety and is very obsessive and possessive over me.   "

55,"[Breeds] [discussion] my dad wants a dog like Spot, our dog who passed away last summer",dogs,t3_a87iq9,3,False,False,a87iq9,"My dads one wish for Christmas was for a dog like our old dog Spot. Spot was a great dog, and can’t ever be replaced by any other pup. He was from the humane society as a puppy when I was 7 (I’m now 22). I picked him out because of his stripe and spots on him. He was a terrier mix puppy. Black and white, not soft except his ears and head. 

Anyway, he says he wants Spot back again and I do too. Spot was my first dog ever. What I’m asking is a good breed or mix of breeds that will have similar traits as my old dog if possible. Or if we should just get another mix rescue dog. We are leaning toward rescue dog right now. 

Some things about Spot that my dad would like in another dog: 
1)Small but not miniature. Spot’s head I think was still below knee level for humans. He doesn’t want a big dog or a small yappy dog. 
2)He mentioned he wants a dog that will check if the “coast is clear” because Spot always did that. 
3)A dog that doesn’t whine 
4) a dog that doesn’t bark a lot or wonder away a lot
5) a dog that can handle being without humans for some time each day (because of work)

We have a large yard but we live close to a busy-ish road. We have a nice clean house with a small/ medium dog door. Our yard is very open and is near a forest. 

We have a mini pincer pekingese mix (Bandit) who whines a lot and always wants my mom. (Dad doesn’t like it, says he doesn’t want another Bandit). We also have 3 cats. Spot and my oldest cat were best buddies. Spot was the one who found him under the porch. I think ever since then my cat has been grumpy. 

Other traits:
Affectionate but easily trainable. 

I would appreciate any opinions or advice. I know we cannot get another Spot, but a dog with Spot traits would be ideal.

We are leaving him with a couple we found on Rover. They have a golden retriever that is very playful. They two of them have already met and we had a chance to walk around the sitter’s house and speak to them about our pup’s daily routine.

The only problem is, they haven’t watched many  dogs before. They are somewhat new to Rover and have only watched two dogs in the past few months. For some reason, I am nervous to leave our dog with an inexperienced dog sitter but we don’t have many options due to the holiday. Our last sitter fostered and boarded dozens of dogs and was also a vet at banfield animal hospital so I felt more comfortable leaving our pup with her.

We are leaving him for 4 nights. Has anyone had a bad experience on Rover? Any professional/experienced dog sitters in this subreddit that could lend some insight? I want to know if we are being too protective of him or if we should be concerned that this couple lacks experience dog sitting. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks!

60,[Help] My dog bit my Girlfriend. Unsure about what to do.,dogs,t3_a86r8n,2,False,False,a86r8n,"Two days ago our dog Frank bit my GF when she called him away from his bone to pet him. She told me she was giving him some scratches when he randomly freaked out and bit her on the face. **She has since been to the ER and everything is fine.** Frank is a 2 year old Male Flat coated retriever. We got him from the pound 4 months ago, besides all this he's a very smart and intelligent dog. He knew the standard sit, stay , don’t piss in the house when we got him. He was very sweet and non aggressive but since we got him he has shown signs of protectiveness. A little with me and a lot with my GF. 

This is not the first time Frank has bitten before. **He bit me on the face** for laying down on his tail (by accident) and **bitten one of our close friends**. In that instance our friend had entered the door, Frank had given them the sniff test and was walking around just doing dog stuff and our friend felt un-easy, they turned away from frank then he bit them on the leg. 

Before he bit my girlfriend and I, we started taking him to dog training classes and even got a personal behavioral trainer, he was doing great. 

Once my GF parents find out about the bite they will demand that we either **give the dog away or kill him.** 

He’s generally a great dog besides all of the biting. My girl and I are unsure of what to do. Is there any hope of getting him to stop this shit or do we have to bite the bullet and give him away.

I had a few bad encounters with friends aggressive dogs when I was young so when a dog shows aggression I get extremely scared. My Aunt came to Visit and is staying for two weeks with her rat terrier, her room is directly outside my room.

My aunts dog has started to consider where my aunt sleep her territory and barks, growls and snaps at me when I leave or go to my room. My aunt at the start just laughed it off, I thought the dog would relax and realize I don’t care about my aunts stuff and just want to go to my room, but she continues to freak out and it is causing me immense stress. It prevents me from using the bathroom or getting things from my room or checking on my cat. My parents gave me the squirt bottle to spray my aunts dog whenever she does this. My aunts dog has also been only targeting me, I’ve given her treats, I’ve ignored her, I’ve tried to be as least threatening as I can be, then I’ve tried telling her no, now trying the squirt bottle.

&amp;#x200B;

She was at the hospital for a day or two and now she's back at my home. I have two other dogs and since she's not vaccinated, dewormed and no flea medication given yet she has to stay in my garden in case she passes anything to my dogs. She's currently on antibiotics for the next 5 days then I will bring her to the vet again. I walk her 2x a day and keep her company as much as I can but I have rescued kittens as well + my existing pets so I can only be there for her so often.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think she is afraid of me since she does come to me when I call for her with a tail wag. Her appetite has been ok, not really ravenous so she does refuse food sometimes and her stool is normal, no diarrhea of sorts. The thing is, she always tries to escape and every time after her walk she refuses to come back home and it breaks my heart. I feel back for removing her off the streets even though I think it's the right thing to do.. maybe she had someone caring for her while she was a stray or had dog friends. I don't know if I'm being too sensitive but I just feel bad for her. I want to immediately put her in my home with the rest of my dogs in a week's time after the vet visit but for now she has to be alone for awhile. Every time I think about her I just cry cos she must be sad or lonely 😭 please advice me and let me know what I can do to make her comfortable until she can come inside my home. Thanks everyone ♥️"
63,[DISCUSSION] My dog keeps urinating on the floor.,dogs,t3_a86hoq,6,False,False,a86hoq,"My dog Cassie (half Golden Retriever, half Border Collie) is a bit older than three months but not four months old yet. She seems (fingers crossed) to be fully housebroken for poop.

However, she will still pee on the floor. No signals or anything, she just squats and goes. It's completely healthy-looking urine, no blood or cloudiness or anything, and she doesn't seem to be in pain so I doubt it's a U.T.I. I also doubt she's incontinent because she doesn't pee in her sleep.

I don't think it's psychological either. She doesn't really seem nervous when she urinates on the floor and while she sometimes does it while excited, I doubt being excited is a necessary condition because she pees on the floor plenty of times when not excited. There is no apparent pattern, it's just random; she seems to be past the ""peeing thirty seconds after drinking"" stage, too.

So why do you think she urinates on the floor and how do we stop it (we're already taking her out heaps of times)?"

68,How do I get my dog to stop barking. [Help],dogs,t3_a82xmi,3,False,False,a82xmi,"Hello, this is my first time posting on this sub, so if this should instead be moved to another subreddit, lmk. Also very long so tl;dr at the bottom. 

So in our family, we have had 3 small dogs at different times. Our oldest, a Yorkie terrier, has been with us for 12 years and is extremely sweet. Around 5 years ago, we got 2 other dogs, both Pekingese. We gave 1 to a family member, and kept the other as a gift for our kids. The Yorkie has always been extremely friendly, and didn’t mind the new member, while the Pekingese has always been very docile, so was fine living with the Yorkie. After being with us for 4 years, someone broke into our backyard and took our Pekingese while my family slept. Our Yorkie has always been very fast and agile, so he wasn’t taken, but the Pekingese, being very docile, was probably taken without much resistance. 

Fast forward to the next day, our kids were heartbroken, because their dog was gone, and were very distraught. Both dogs were chipped, but after several weeks of making signs and calling local shelters to no avail, we gave up. Very quickly we decided to get another dog, and we adopted from a friend a Pomeranian. 

This Pomeranian was a puppy, only around 6 weeks old, and was never very aggressive towards our Yorkie, as our Yorkie wasn’t aggressive towards it. While raising it, I was the primary caregiver; bathing, feeding, and taking this dog for walks. While on walks, he was never aggressive towards dogs we encountered, simple looking at it and continuing walking. 

During the next few months, we’ve had several parties, and during some parties we had a recurring guest who liked to bring her dog as well. Whenever that dog was near our Pomeranian, our Pomeranian would bark NON-STOP. Never getting near it, but continuously barking at it from a few feet away. That other dog is was very friendly as well, not barking back or going near it, but our dogs constant barking was annoying, so we simply separated them and that was it. This happened a couple times afterwards, but we did the same thing. 

Now, fast forward a couple more months, approximately 6 months since our dog was stolen, to this week, and we get a call from the next town over, saying they have our dog. We rush over the next day, and our Pekingese is there, a little fatter then he left us, but it was him. Our kids were ecstatic about this news, as was I. On the drive home, in the back of my mind, I had the thought of how the Pomeranian was going to handle the new dog, and became a bit worried.

Upon coming home, the Pekingese was very happy, wagging its tail and running around, obviously overjoyed to be back home. I was the only one home, so I brought him to the backyard where the other dogs were, and let the inside. I held the Pekingese in my lap and sat down. Letting the other dogs smell him. The Yorkie remembered him, and reacted happy and went about his day. But the Pomeranian smelled him for about 5 seconds, and began barking loudly. 

The Pekingese smelled him and looked at him, but aside from that, more or less ignored the Pomeranian. I had work to do at my desk here at home, so I left them inside and began to work. For the rest of the day, the Pomeranian would NOT STOP BARKING. It would bark for and hour, take a 5 minute break doing something, then look at the other dog, the begin barking again. I got tired of it and put the Pomeranian outside and let the Yorkie and Pekingese stay inside. At night, I put them all outside, fed them in separate bowls, and stayed outside to make sure nothing happened. They all ate their food, but after the Pomeranian finished eating, he began his barking again. They sleep inside, so I had to have them sleep in different rooms for the night, because the Pomeranian wouldn’t stop growling and barking. This proceeded for the next 2 days, with me trying different things I read online, like taking them for walks together and just trying to let them get used to each others smells, but to no avail.

During this, the Pomeranian wouldn’t do anything but bark, while the Pekingese wouldn’t do anything to retaliate. Finally, the Pomeranian started to nip  at the Pekingese’s legs or face, and the Pekingese started to bite and bark back. This has been happening for the last day or so. So my request for you guys is if there is any other ways that we may get the Pomeranian to stop being aggressive towards the Pekingese, or at least to stop barking, because I am getting very close to just buying a muzzle. I can’t stay home all day and keep them separated, nor can I leave them alone in the backyard in fear of them hurting one another. 

tl;dr One of our dogs was stolen and we got another dog to replace him. After 6 months, our old dog showed up, but the replacement dog is extremely aggressive towards the old dog and won’t stop barking and fighting. What do I do?

Warning those images are quite ""graphic"" they're what my bloodstained clothes and leg looked like after running barefoot so fast for so long, I held out a shred of hope when I got there but it wasn't enough, she passed and I had to bury her in a shallow grave, It was a very hard thing to do since I had a ton of fantasies of freezing her once she gets old or perserving her brain but that was taken away from me in a second, Hug your dogs tight please, and I just want to know people will never forget my dog the only thing I love in this life my terrier pinscher, Another womans dog was attacked but fortunately it survived, she took a pic of me to use against the man who owns the 2 rotwillers that attacked both our dogs, I'm not sure how this story falls into the rules but I had to put it out here, I love her so much and she is still with me, forever.

I Just don't want to forget and I still can't digest it, I still want to pass out."

72,[HELP] House-training two dogs,dogs,t3_a83yag,6,False,False,a83yag,"I’m moving back in with my mother on the 1st and I need help with her dogs. For most of my adult life we’ve lived across the country. I visited for the first time yesterday and am lost for words. My mother has basically been letting her dogs use the bathroom inside. On the carpet. She shampoos the “trouble areas”, where they piss regularly, everyday she says. I think it’s more like once a month. 

I don’t have any other options especially considered we’ve made plans for me to move in. I’ve already spoken with a professional carpet cleaning company to start cleaning the carpets regularly for the smell. 

These are two older dogs. Probably about 7 and 10, both chihuahuas. How do I house train these dogs in an environment they are used to shitting and pissing in? I need help. ): "

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Introduction\*\*

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* We are looking at GSPs, Weim’s, Dalmatians, Aussies, Rhodesian Ridgebacks. (I know all of these dogs besides the sporting ones have much different temperaments and needs, but just giving you all a wide scope of what we have looked at)

\* On average we can spend 1.5 to 2 hours a day exercising. When the pup is old enough he or she will also be my running companion (up to 30mpw). Can also bike the dog. We live close to a dog park and can go there 3-4 times a week. Hiking on the weekends.   
8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

9) What size dog are you looking for?  
\* 45-75lbs

\* Very  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
\* My girlfriend prefers a large snuggly dog. Wants to feel comfortable walking with the dog at night. The involvement will be just about 50/50 except most of the exercise will come from me. Olive (our 1 year old kitten) would love a play partner and snuggle buddy as well.

74,[Discussion] What do you do when someone says they want a designer dog?,dogs,t3_a7znr0,152,False,False,a7znr0,"My future brother-in-law recently moved into a small townhome with his other brother. He's a major dog lover, so we've been talking to him a lot about our soon-to-be-puppy (picking up our golden retriever in 3 weeks!). He mentioned he hopes to get a dog in the spring, and that he's looking to get a mini goldendoodle or mini australian labradoodle because of the size and no shedding. 

What do you say in these instances? Do you just let people be ignorant and support BYB? Do you call them out on it and try to tell them why they shouldn't? The situation is a bit tricky because their family dog is a goldendoodle and they love her, so having to tell them that they shouldn't support designer dogs would probably be seen as an attack on their current beloved dog. What would you do?"
75,[Help] I'm in rehab. Should I see my dog over Christmas? A question about time and separation...,dogs,t3_a85p5g,2,False,False,a85p5g,"Ive been in an out-of-state inpatient rehab facility for 5 months now, away from my 2 year old Beagle for 6 months in all. Ive been fortunate enough to have a friend take excellent care of him while Im gone and we are both doing very well. I get to go home for Christmas on Monday and have to come back on Friday. After the holidays I will be spending another 6 months here but will be going home for other various reasons for a few days at a time. Im wondering, for his sake, whether or not it would be a good or bad idea for me to see my dog during those times. Would it be detrimental to his mental and emotional wellbeing for us to be reunited after so long only to leave again? Or would it be better to not see him until I am able to take him home for good? As much as I miss him and want to see him, Ill do what's ultimately best for him in this situation. Thanks!"

So I have my beautyful baby Maxxie. His dad is a Rottweiler, and his mom a blue Pittbull.
Maxxie is 3, almost 4 years old. We recieved him as a gift from his parents owner. We didn't plan to have a dog, but soon the little one stole our hearts.
He grew up healthy and happy. The vet checked him up for vaccines and stuff. 
He was pretty normal untill about 20 month ago slowly some weird sores appered in his paws. The vet told us that it was due to walking on heat surfaces, but we only walked him at nigh.  Anyways, the walks were suspended. He recovered with some antibacterial spray the vet gave us. 
He took month but he was healthy again. Then about 14 months ago he developed some weird bald patches in his back. The patches soon became small sores covered in what I though it was fat or oil. Another trip to the vet reveled it was some infection. He gave us some antibiotic and then steroids. That only worked for a while. Then the vet suggested too much fat on Maxxies diet. So we switched onto another brand of dog food. That didn't work.
Antibiotic soap baths? Done. 
So we tried a second opinion. Was Maxxie allergic to pollen? Leaves? Fabric softener? Even tap water?  We stopped the walking again, washed all his clothes, only feed him bottled water and specific food. Nothing.
Im so sad right now. Seeing my poor baby like this. The sores started bleeding. He bites himself and make it worst. 
Third vet opinion: maybe he has fleas. No he doesn't but anyways we bought some liquid to prevent fleas. 
I don't know what else to do. Please, please help.
I would like to post some pictures but it might be too graphic. "

Background: I moved over the weekend and I’m crashing in my parents’ basement for the next few weeks until my new lease starts. I also started a new job on Monday so my dogs have to stay at home all day. At my last job, they came to work with me and sat under my desk all day every day, I could take them out as much as they wanted and they could play with the other office dogs all day. So naturally they are a little freaked out about all of the sudden changes happening all at once, moving out of their house, in a new place without their mom 40+ hours a week.

Any tips on getting them to stop having potty accidents in my parents’ basement? I have a potty pad out and they blatantly ignore it, popping a squat on the carpet a few feet away from it. 

Also wondering if maybe my girl dog has a UTI? She is peeing two huge pees in the middle of the night when she normally would go all night without having to go to the bathroom. When I take her on walks she stops every 10 feet to pee and nothing comes out (obviously after she emptied her bladder first time she popped a squat). Help!

Potty schedule: 

7am our for a quick pee
7:30-8 long walk for pee/poo
Noon: my dad take them on a walk
Late afternoon: my dad lets them out in the backyard to go pee
7ish home from work: we go on a quick 15 min walk
Bedtime: pee break before bed

This is more than enough potty breaks, so how do I get them to stop peeing?

86,[Breeds] - Please recommend a breed for me,dogs,t3_a7zd22,18,False,False,a7zd22,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I owned a shepherd mix rescue for roughly 12 years.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescue

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

 My ideal dog would possess the following traits:

* Relatively small and quiet breed (I live alone in a 2 bedroom apartment)

- Calm demeanor, somewhat lower-medium energy level. I don't have the right type of space for a hyper dog, but I'd still like a dog that will have enough energy to go out on hikes if possible.
- Will travel well, as I spend a lot of time traveling back and forth to my GF's place
- Low prey drive (GF has two cats)
 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I don't really have too much of a preference, but I've never liked beagles, schnauzers, or other curly-haired dogs. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands, and to stay with me off-leash.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I mostly work from home, so I have a lot of time to interact with the dog

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Same as above, I am home almost every day, and have a dog park on-site, and can generally spend as much time exercising the dog each day as it needs. I do live in the northeast, so heavy snow can affect my ability to provide exercise for short periods of time. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'd likely pay a professional to do this, so a dog that requires less grooming is preferred.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Something less than 50lbs

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I can tolerate, but the less barking the better (apartment), and not a big fan of slobbering dogs.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Fairly important. There is a dog park at my apartment, and I'd like for the dog to be able to interact off-leash. I also do a lot of hiking, and would definitely enjoy having the ability to have the dog off-leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in the middle. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Somewhere in the middle

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I'm fine with a dog barking at a door knock, but I would like a dog that will warm up to visitors quickly

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. The rules of my apartment do not allow any dogs that are aggressive.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I think I've covered them

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not often at all, since most of my work is done from home. Occasionally, I go into work, maybe 2-3 times a week, and am gone for 3-4 hours at a time.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone, but when visiting my girlfriend she only requires that the dog doesn't eat her cats.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* I don't have kids, so no. If I brought the dog to work, it would interact with kids often, but that's not a requirement.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent currently. The restricted breeds are: Pitbull, American Staffordshire Terrier, Rottweiler, Doberman, Akita, Chow, Mastiff, Great Dane, German Shepherd, Bull Terrier, Husky, Dalmatian or Alaskan Malamute or any mix of these breeds.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

87,[Help] Food changes after life changes?,dogs,t3_a82fdd,1,False,False,a82fdd,"I have a 7 year old female Beagle. She's always been a chow hound - will take as much food as you'll give. Because of this, I've broken her feedings between two meals a day.

I give her half a cup (not an actual Cup, just the cup I use to draw food from the bag) in the morning before I leave, and half a cup in the afternoon when I get home.

She's always devoured her food as soon as I've set it down.

Until last week. Last Thursday I took in a coworker who was about to be homeless and I'm letting him crash on my reading/coffee room's couch for a while. I try to keep her out of that room because she's been known to pull some books and decoratives off of low shelves, and I have some expensive editions, collectables, and such in there, alongside my (religious) altar.

So when my guest is staying in that room, we keep the door closed. She's spent some time around him, however, and they've become quick friends, she lets him pet her and is generally welcoming of him in 'her domain'. But she has seemed a little more alert, and she's spent a good deal of time watching that closed door.

However, she's been eating much less since he came. When I feed her in the morning, I've been coming back to an untouched or half-eaten bowl, and she'll eat the rest later on, without prompting me for more, like she sometimes does by pawing the bowl- which she normally does when I get home and don't feed her immediately.

Any ideas? Thanks!"

She also had an episode of paralysis in her rear legs last week, but I held her up until she managed to walk it off. 
All of this is devastating to watch. I don't think she's in pain, but it's heartbreaking to see her unable to live as she used to. I'm thinking it might be nearly her time, but I don't want to give up on her just because she's old. I suppose I would like advice or reassurance from any of you? "

From the start, though, it has just been an incredibly stressful and un-fun experience. We work opposite schedules generally, and there are only 2-3 days a week where the dog would need to be crated for at most 8 hours (we are sometimes able to come back for a walk at lunch, but not always). We were told by the rescue that the dog's previous foster worked similar hours so it would not be an issue. From the start, however, whenever we left her alone she would be obviously stressed out and break out of her crate. The rescue gave us some info on crate training but after a few weeks of that there was no improvement and the dog was getting even more stressed out. It is also worth noting that the dog only had these problems when we left, otherwise she was perfectly content to sleep in her crate and went in voluntarily very often. She howls incessantly during the day, according to our neighbor. When the rescue got us a gate and suggested we try gating her in a room, she tore down the sturdy gate. She has scratched the hell out of exit doors in our house (the front/back doors she sees us walk out of).

Some of the chaos she's caused when alone is just inexperience. Every time we come home and find something chewed up, it's a new lesson in puppy-proofing the house, and that's fine and to be expected. But the rescue kept blowing off the clear symptoms (not necessarily officially diagnosable behavior) of separation anxiety. We understand that many rescue dogs go through a decompression phase and that the amount of time can vary drastically, but this dog is incredibly stressed out when left alone and even if it is a temporary problem, she deserves help getting through it. We are more than happy to help her but we have never done this before and need help ourselves as we do not know how to approach the problem. Our inexperience and need for help should any issues arise was made abundantly clear when we were asked to foster (the president of the rescue asked us to help out, which we were happy to do since we were considering it anyway). No matter how much we asked for help, we rarely get an answer.

We had previously looked at adopting an adorable malamute mix with separation anxiety, and decided against it because we thought our first dog having anxiety issues would be a bad idea as we were not confident about our ability to properly handle it without any experience. Again, I totally get that it's way too early to diagnose anything, but after weeks of dealing with howling and scratching and chewing and getting silence, if anything, from the rescue I was ready to go insane.

It really just comes down to the lack of communication - and this is where my main question is. What sort of help do you expect from a rescue organization when fostering a dog from them? I know they're probably dealing with a million other things and may not have time to walk a pair of panicking first-time foster parents through how to handle anxiety symptoms, but I feel like we were crazy for asking for help so many times. We had larger problems getting things they said they would provide for us - a lead for our backyard, harness to help with her pulling, some more durable chew toys - but again I have no idea if those are things a rescue will typically provide or if they're supposed to come out of our pocket. The rescue told us they would be providing anything we needed but the only things they have actually delivered on are a gate and food.

Are we crazy and needy? Was it just a shitty situation, having two people who couldn't have someone home at all times handling a dog who hated being alone?"

94,[Breeds] Whippet vs. Border Terrier,dogs,t3_a83nyt,8,False,False,a83nyt,"Hello r/dogs! I’d appreciate some advice on picking the right breed for my partner and I. I filled out the breed questionnaire a few days ago but only got one response. I’m on mobile otherwise I would have copied and pasted.

After a lot of research and lengthy discussion, my partner and I think that either a Whippet or a Border Terrier might be right for us. We’d love to hear some opinions about these two breeds with regard to our lifestyle. In summary - we are a moderately active couple living in a one bedroom apartment. We have multiple parks around us and enjoy revolving our life around our dog! I go into a lot more detail in the breed questionnaire.

We keep tossing up between the two (very different!) breeds. We don’t want to start contacting breeders before we are absolutely sure on the breed we would like. In saying that, registered Whippet breeders are a LOT more common in Australia (100+ Whippet breeders vs. &lt;40 Border Terrier breeders). But that shouldn’t be the deciding factor.

I’d love to hear your thoughts if you have had experience with either breed, or if you have any other breed suggestions we are very open to hearing them. You should be able to find all the information that you need in the breed questionnaire (my post history), but feel free to ask further questions. Thanks in advance!"

Today i noticed she didn’t eat her AM food and it was PM food time, so I put her old food back in, spilling some on the ground.

96,[Discussion] How Frequently Does A Cattle Dog Puppy Need Care?,dogs,t3_a7zx3m,3,False,False,a7zx3m,"3 years ago I had IT admin job where I worked from home. I was able to get a Cattle Dog puppy and raise him and give him training and play myself multiple times during the day. It was cool how he even as an adult he would still try and sit in my lap like he did as a puppy, even though he grew to 70 lbs. Unfortunately he was attacked unprovoked and killed by a pitbull off it's leash 2 months ago.

I really miss him and would like to get another puppy, but I work in an office now so I can't be home to let him out every few hours. I can look for another job that works remotely, but was curious what the recommendations are for how often they need interaction during the day.

Also, is getting an older puppy an option? I got my last puppy right at 6 weeks, but if I get one at 3-4 months does that affect thier bond with you as the owner at all?"
97,[help] Dog refuses to poop on a leash.,dogs,t3_a7zwne,2,False,False,a7zwne,"Zero is a 6 your old Great Dane, lab mix. He has lived in the house with access to a backyard for 5 years and has never had to poop on a leash before. He is completely fine on walks and marks everywhere, walks are actually his favorite part of the day. However, no matter how often or how long I walk him, he will not poop while on a leash.


I just moved to an apartment complex so there is no way I can take him off. There's no dog park nearby that I can go to to let him loose, so I don't really know what to do at this point. He gets fed only at night and hopes that in the morning he'll have to go bad enough that he'll just go on our walks. When I was feeding him twice a day, he would poop on my rugs in the house while I was at work.  He has never once had an accident in the house before this, and I know that he feels really bad about it.


I'm kind of at a loss. I walk him 15 to 30 minutes per walk and about 5 walks a day. We go all over the complex, even to the parts where it's mainly trees and no people or cars are around. His recall is 50/50 so I don't feel comfortable taking him off. I've tried a regular leash and am now using an extendable (I know everyone hates these, pls just spare me) in hopes that he feels less ""forced"" to be near me.


Does anyone have any advice? He feels bad. I feel bad. We all feel bad. Thank you. "

106,[Fluff] Love your dogs (And/Or your cats... I guess... ;) ),dogs,t3_a7ueeg,1,False,False,a7ueeg,"2016 was without a doubt the worst year of my life. I nearly lost my Mum to Cancer. End of a 10 year relationship. ""Homeless"" for a moment (Not truely. I was in a hostel, so thankful for that). And June that year marked the start of a 19 month saga whereby my ex did some shady things and essentially stole my dogs. 

It cost me $10,000 in legal fees to get them back. But worse, it cost me 19 months without my two beloved rescues, in a deep pit of depression. That's all I want to say about that (unless anyone wants to ask me stuff. I'm an open book).

But in March this year, I got them back. My Lab, and my Husky are home. I have legal bills to pay, and I'm ""behind in life"" because of the stress and anxiety of that situation and the time I devoted to fighting for them.

But they're home. You can forget about everything sad I just told you. That's why this is [Fluff]. My dogs fixed me. They are my world. The worst days I'll have going forward won't be half as bad as they would have been without them. They are the joy of my life.

I know if you're on this thread, there's a good chance you feel the same way. But promise me you'll never neglect them. Never take them for granted. Never look at them as a burden. They'll never ask for more from you then food and love. 

As bad as my situation was (and it was bad), I consider myself to be the luckiest person in the world. My dogs were taken from me. It was as if they were dead, but then I got them back. Very few people can call themselves that lucky.

I had a few good friends who lost their dogs this year. And I'm sure that's happened to many of you this year, or in the past as well. And if you have a pet, it will happen in the future. There's no softening that blow. So to anyone who is going through that loss, or know what it feels like, I wish you well, especially at this time of the year.

If you're near a dog right now, hug it for me, and for yourself. :) I am."
107,"[Discussion] If your dog has unexplained seizures, check his/her dog food for Rosemary extract",dogs,t3_a7kg4q,242,False,False,a7kg4q,"Both of my dogs were on a diet of Blue Buffalo kibble. My youngest started having grand mal seizures around 1.5 years old. I took him to the vet and they concluded that he has epilepsy. They wanted to put him on medication for it, but I knew that the meds had bad side effects. 

His seizures were still coming pretty far apart and never more than 30 seconds so I did some research and found that spices like rosemary, sage, and fennel could trigger seizures. Lo’ and behold, all the Blue Buffalo kibble and treats had rosemary extract in the ingredients list. 

I started looking for a kibble that didn’t contain rosemary, which is surprisingly difficult! I’d say 95% of the kibbles I researched contained rosemary. Taste of the Wild doesn’t, however, and since I’ve been feeding him that, he hasn’t had a single seizure. We’re just about a year seizure-free! 

Edit: I’m not trying to pretend to be a scientist and say that rosemary is definitely the cause of your dog’s seizures. I know this is anecdotal, but it’s something that’s worked for me, and rosemary is a trigger in some dogs. It may not end your dog’s seizures, but it’s an option to look into. "

I just feel like this is political and the dogs should not be suffering because of it.

Basically the city is saying its a liability to have them there when they lost their non-profit status by the state...

Shelter: ""Figueroa, who became director of FOCAS in October, said she was the one who notified the city about the nonprofit’s Franchise Tax Board violation. According to Figueroa, the former FOCAS head did not file taxes in 2014 because the organization did not open a bank account or receive nonprofit status until 2015.
She says the problem is expected to be rectified soon, and that she has offered to work as a volunteer to care for the dogs during the 90-day deadline issued by the city, but officials have so far declined that offer.""

City official:  ""The city gives $2,500 a month to FOCAS and owns the Second Street building that is home to the shelter, but when government officials were notified the nonprofit is suspended by the state, it became a liability for Orange Cove, said Mayor Victor Lopez.""

“They are in violation and the council had to take action. Somebody’s got to be held accountable for not reporting those funds that were given to them,” Lopez said.""


Please follow the link below to sign the petition to at least allow the volunteers who know and love these animals to be allowed to care for them again.


Update: The paperwork has been sorted on the tax issue as of yesterday morning 7am. They had an email sent to the city and the city is saying they can't accept an email.

The shelter said it would be posted by Friday morning but the city's response was that they can schedule them for the next city council meeting in JANUARY.

There are people who are genuinely mean inside and I'm wondering if dogs experience the same to varying degrees?

I might be anthropomorphizing. I have a Shiba who's been pretty stereotypical of an aloof and independent Shiba. I know we're not supposed to call our dogs jerks but he really is sometimes. One time when he was much younger, I made a horrible training mistake where I was giving him frozen peanut butter kongs to eat while crated to help him adjust to being crated. The mistake was me taking his kong away before he was done because I put so much PB in there and through some trust/exchange exercises, he lets me take his treat without growling at me. 

When this was happening, he had this weird look in his eye, like an upward angry warning glare right before he would growl. The closest I can compare it to is like a wolf stalking its prey? 

Lately I've been training him to stay out of the kitchen because he's been pushing his boundaries and whenever I tell him no, he gives me the same kind of glare instead of his usual puppy eyes. I don't know if I'm uncomfortable because I was so shocked that he snapped/growled at me the first time. My husband says he senses weakness (I spoil him).

The past 2 years she has been suffering from kidney failure and a progressing heart murmur. It's long beem to the point where she's needing a diaper 24/7. Of course, her personality still showed, until I went away to college. She started sleeping more and more and eating less and less, up until these past 2 weeks where she stopped eating entirely.

I'm also worried about our other poodle who was raised by Scully. Scully was a breeding dog before we adopted her and she came packed with motherly instincts. Our toy poodle, Zoe, was adopted so she could have a puppy to raise. I'm worried Zoe is going to become heartbroken. I know I certainly am.

117,"[Fluff] As a first time dog owner, I just feel I need to share.",dogs,t3_a7z19z,3,False,False,a7z19z,"Hi r/dogs! Just after moving in to our new apartment, my gf and I adopted two 8-month old mutt sisters, Mari and Juca. I know a lot of posts here by new dog-owners are all about puppy regret, so I was kind of ready for that. Luckily, in the week or so we've had them, I have been feeling nothing of the sort, at least yet! I love them, cuddle with them, and don't mind their doggy smell, picking up their poo, or, you know, not having a life anymore, which were some of the stuff I feared I would not adapt to. :) Still, I would like to share some concerns and questions, more to know if these things are normal and hear other's experiences, either to reassure me or to tell if I'm doing anything wrong. I have been all over r/pups101 and youtube for a long time leading up to this, but of course practice is harder than theory.

1) Potty training is hard! Right now I'm on vacation and so can focus entirely on them, but there will be days when me and my gf will both be working long hours and will only be able to walk them once a day. So, when they *must* go at home, I would like them to go on the newspaper in a designated area in the laundry/kitchen area. The problem is they sort of elected the middle of the living room as their preferred spot for pooping! Everywhere I look on the internet, people tell me to praise them and give treats when they do the right thing, but how can I do that when they have not once pooped in the right place? When walking them, they are inconsistent. Sometimes they poop, sometimes not, sometimes in the morning, some in the evening. Everytime, I praise and give treats, but just this morning Juca didn't poop even after 24h since last time, and after eating (and I walked 1h30), so I'm just sitting at home vigilantly watching her. I know she will go in the living room but I'm not sure what to do if I catch her in the act. Is all this normal and will it come with time, or can it go on like this for ever?

2) As this subreddit seems very US-centered, please bear in mind that, culturally, people differ greatly in their attitudes to dogs. Where I live, while people adore their dogs, crating dogs is virtually unheard of. We are keeping them at night locked in the kitchen/laundry area (and also when home alone), and just this is almost shocking to my gf (who is a native). So crate training is out of the question...

3) I know adopting siblings is a bad idea. But I did not know it at the time. Again, these are basically rescue dogs, so the people previously in charge of them have no knowledge of such subtelties, they think it's extra cute that they are sisters, and would not give them away separated. I still did not need to separate them, and so have been walking them together (with zero previous experience), so it has been fun as you can imagine! Again, culture here is more laid back about these things.

4) RIP shoes? Is that the long and short of it? What do people do in practice? Simply never leave shoes where they can reach them, or is there another way?

5) Hobbies. I like to paint in my free time. Can anyone maintain a hobby owning dogs?

These are my experiences so far! Any input is appreciated, and sorry for the wall of text."

He first did on Monday night, but we had been to his first puppy play class so I assumed maybe it could be from excitement. Then the next night there were no accidents, but then this morning when I went to take him out to the bathroom he had done it again. All over. 

The first week and a half of him being home, his kennel was in the same room as me and I slept next to it. His kennel has been in a separate room for a week and a half now and he doesn’t whine at all, so I assumed it was going okay. I put it in a different room because I have to get up at night and he wakes up instantly the moment I move. 

Does anyone have any ideas why he is doing this or how we can help the situation? We take him out to go to the bathroom every 3-4 hours at night"
121,[Breeds] Looking for help choosing breed of new dog! &lt;3,dogs,t3_a7srvh,22,False,False,a7srvh," 

1. **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

Will not be our first dog. Replacing our recently passed Lhasa-poo mix, who lived to the ripe age of 17. He was a lazy turd, but was well trained and very treat-motivated. Personally, have never had an issue training dogs and didn't have any obstacles with ownership, so open to new experiences.

1. **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?**

Prefer a reputable breeder. Where I'm located, (Oregon), there seems to be a bit of a shortage of pets, as there really aren't a whole lot of rescues that I have found near me. If anyone from Oregon has a few recommendations other than the Humane Society, i'd love to hear them!

1. **Describe your ideal dog.**

Looking for a loving, medium dog. I feel that it's a vane request, but I really (obviously) love beautiful, athletic dogs like the border collie and Australian shepherd. My preference is a high life expectancy, few medical issues and above all very intelligent.

1. **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I absolutely love Border Collies, Australian Shepherds and similar due to their insane intelligence, loyalty and the millions of posts of ""man's best friend"" regarding these breeds. I'm not a huge fan of labs and golden retrievers, as many of my friends have a few younger purebreds that are extremely lovable but beyond wild, which i'm sure comes with the fact that they're younger and not super well trained. Additionally, another friend has a German Shorthair and Brittany which are hunting dogs, whom are both super loving and friendly, and their temperament is spot on with being laid back and relaxed, but they're almost too open to other people and not super ""loyal"" to their owner. They are VERY well trained. Kind of looking for a middle ground between ""active and hyper"" and ""laid back and loyal"".

I have heard mixed reports about JUST HOW MUCH exercise working dogs need, as from personal experience two of my friends have Aussie shepherds that are super happy with simply good, long walks. With this in mind, I'm 100% open to recommendations of other breeds, and criticism/ideas, or tips if I were to go this route.

1. **What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Looking to do the basic stuff, heel, sit, stay, lay down, go, fetch etc etc but really would love to play with expanding on additional stuff too. My main goal is to have a dog that is extremely responsive of those commands, rather than knowing 3 million different commands.

**Care Commitments**

6.	**How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

About 2 hours per day of exercise, i'd imagine. Give or take an hour or so for sure. There would be constant companionship though, when i'm home in the morning and back mid-day.

**7.	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

Probably about 2 hours a day. Have a large yard and a park across the street. We have a local dog park, but i've never personally been to it. We also have pretty much immediate access to multiple forests and a very very large community park attached to another large community park, so there's definitely places to walk/hike, play fetch and socialize.

**8.	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

Preferably no home cleaning (ears, etc) but we did pay for a professional groomer. If it's occasional/daily brushing along with the groomer, there's no issue there.

**Personal Preferences**

9.	**What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium would probably be the preference, 40-80 pounds.

**10.	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Preferably no slobber, but a bit of shedding and barking isn't a huge issue.

**11.	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

Fairly important. Not a deal breaker, but would for sure be nice for walks around the neighborhood

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12.	**Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Snuggly for sure.

**13.	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

Eager-to-please is a big upside, but independence would not be a bad thing either.

**14.	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

Protection is not a huge deal where I live, but interactions with strangers and visitors should be positive rather than aggressive.

**15.	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

I'm willing to manage, as our last dog was confrontational towards bigger dogs when he was younger, but began being more receptive once we were able to socialize him more. Unopposed either way, but the dog would be alone in the home w/o another pooch so that is something to keep in mind.

**16.	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Not particularly. Licking always pisses me off.

**Lifestyle**

**17.	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Generally about 4 hours a day, give or take.

**18.	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

**19.	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

We do have a (gecko? idk) smaller lizard in one of our rooms, but it's behind a locked door in a glass enclosure.

**20.	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Not in the family, neighbors do have children though. Will always be supervised.

**21.	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

No

**22.	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

Portland, OR.

No.

**23.	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

Generally about \~35-40 in the winter and \~70-80 in the summer, with obvious outliers. Can get up to 100 and down to 20ish, but is rare.

**Additional Information and Questions**

**24.	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

Do go back and forth between a second house every few days for a day or two which has a family member with a dog allergy, so while the residual hairs are not an issue if they shed, bringing the dog with for a few days is not an option. With this in mind, wife/kids would for sure take care of the dog while i'd be gone."

125,[Help] My dog has basically stopped eating the past 2 days.,dogs,t3_a7uq9l,4,False,False,a7uq9l,"Hello r/dogs,

I have a little monster of a Maltese-Shih Tzu  that I love more than anything; he has always been a fussy eater (won't eat certain dog foods, loves certain brands for a period of time then won't go near it) but now it's come to the point where he hasn't eaten anything but a pork chop I cooked for him yesterday morning.

My dog has a process when it comes to eating. He will stare at me as I chop up his meat and put it in his bowl, and then stare at said meat for a period of time, probably making sure none of my 4 cats are hovering around, but he knows they stay well away from his food. 
My dog will then pick up a piece of meat and either run to the couch and smash it back, or run outside and hide it for later use. I'm not sure if this behavior formed when he was a puppy and had a large litter of brothers and sisters to compete with, or he is just a fussy little thing. Since I moved in and met this dog (just over a year) he has adapted to eating in the morning when I'm around, and again very late at night when I'm home from work because he knows he will get a Shmacko when he finishes his meal.

A friend with a girl dog has asked if we could try and mate our dogs. He met her a few days ago, and to say the least, he's smitten. Since he's met her, all he's eaten is the pork chop that I hand-fed him twice yesterday.
I don't know if this event has caused him to stop eating, or maybe something to do with my Guinea pig giving birth a few days ago. Or maybe he is on strike to demonstrate expensive raw meat is the new way to go.

I will be going to the vet tomorrow and talking about some kind of anti-anxiety pills and hope she has some idea of what is going on.
I am sorry for the wall of text, I get off track sometimes, but I was hoping some people have had this issue with their dogs and have any advice.

128,[Fluff] So very thankful my puppy is alive and well—being a new dog mom is a rollercoaster!,dogs,t3_a7p3l2,4,False,False,a7p3l2,"I’ve always grown up with family dogs but those puppers chose other members of the family as their “hooman” so to speak. For example, our last family dog (English bulldog) really bonded and preferred my mom. 

After our bulldog, Max, went over the rainbow bridge some 5 years ago our family was open to having another family dog. 

Eventually Bam Bam, a 5 month old shih tzu, chose us. I immediately felt a close bond with him, unlike our other beloved dogs, and just chalked it up to the new puppy smell and puppy dog eyes. 

But over the past month we’ve had him in our home, I have spent the most time with him because the rest of my family have busier schedules. My mother has since deemed Bam Bam as my fur baby and I’m now his dog mom. 

Last night when I took him out to go potty, I noticed that he had something in his mouth. It looked like a weird old vegetable peel or maybe even a mushroom. 

I panicked since mushroom poisoning in dogs is very serious and something to watch out for. I asked everyone if they thought it was a mushroom but it was hard to tell. My sister and I looked up as much as we can regarding the different poisonous strains. My parents and my sister reassured me that none of them looked like that thing in his mouth. We made a plan to observe him for the next couple hours and rush him to the vet as soon as we noticed something was up. 

I felt sick to my stomach the entire night. I kept thinking I should have done a better job at keeping an eye on him. We crate train him, but I decided to let him sleep on my bed to make sure he didn’t have and delayed symptoms. I kept waking up to check on him. 

Over 15 hours have passed and so far my dog is as normal and snuggly as can be. He was probably confused why I was so anxious last night. I realize now that I may have overreacted but I can’t help but feel extremely grateful that he’s with us and chose me as his human. 

tl:dr I’m the primary caretaker of our puppy and I thought he had eaten a poisonous mushroom when I took him out last night. He hasn’t shown any symptoms and I may have overreacted. But I’m extremely glad he’s ok.

130,[Help] Good Supplements for old dog joints.,dogs,t3_a7tznt,9,False,False,a7tznt,"So my Lab is 10, and still in good health, and pretty mobile. Walks at full speed and can get up to a good medium pace in the park for short amounts of time.

He used to weigh 50kg before I rescued him, and it took a toll on his back hips. He lost most of that weight but is putting a bit back on just due to being a bit less active because he's a bit older and slower.

I've got him on some weight control food to help with that, and walking him lots, and it's getting better. (Unfortunately, budget reasons right now are preventing me from getting him premium food, or a completely raw diet, but he does get lots of bones and veggies etc). And over the next few months I'll be really looking for a great diet for BOTH my dogs.

I have a 7yo active husky (who also happens to be a fussy eater), and the lab above. So their requirements are a bit different. SO, keeping budget in mind a little bit, but without resorting to low grade shit...

1. Can you suggest a good diet that works for both?

2. If not, can you suggest a diet for each?

3. Can you suggest some great supplements for my lab in particular, to help him move a bit more freely (he doesn't have hip problems. Just old creaky joints). 

4. My Husky is in perfect health but is also getting to an age where I want to start preparing for her retirement years. So good supplements for her as well. One that would work for both dogs would be perfect."
131,"[Help] Dog toys that keep dogs super interested, and last.",dogs,t3_a7twdg,5,False,False,a7twdg,"Hey guys, TL;DR.... see above. :) (But if possible, be brand non specific, as I live in Australia so may not have the same range as you).

So basically, I have a 7 year old husky (energetic but knows how to relax :)) and a 10 year old Lab (pretty happy just chilling. :) ). They get on lead walks at least 3 days a week, and off lead park runs at least three times a week, and pretty often a road trip to a cool beach some place. That's a minimum of 6 days, but it's more when possible.

But I'm a freelance photographer/filmer. Some days I'm out on set, working, (No different to a 9-5 really). But when I'm not ""working"", I do all the other stuff I need to do (Marketing, retouching etc) from home.

I love this freedom because I get to spend a lot of time with my pups. I love to play with them, and I love spending as much time as I can with them. But...

Sometimes when I'm home with them, it's a ""work day"". I have to treat it like one, and that means ignoring them a bit, staring at a screen. Patting them if they come up to me (which I love), but generally they just lay down next to me. If I move to get a drink or use the bathroom, they get up and follow me like we're about to do something fun. Honestly, it feels bad, so quite often I take 30+ minutes to just be with them. But that adds up in terms of time not spent working, which actually leads to later nights and not being able to ""switch off"" at 5 because I didn't get enough done during the day.

So... I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for toys that will last a while (so I won't need to rebuy constantly), will keep them occupied, preferably won't result in too much mess (I live in a share house), and that they'll love, whether they're right next to me or alone for the day.

They do like to play together (tug of war with a rope for example), but they tend to do that almost for my amusement. :) They make sure I'm watching before they start. And as soon as one wins, the other is left with nothing to do.

Feel free to shout out some brand names, but I live in Australia so I'd rather hear about styles of toys if there's options, because I may not be able to get the brand you mention.

Oh, and it doesn't have to be a ""toy"" either. Tips welcome. But not food related. I often give them a bone to work on during the day, and Snickers (the lab) doesn't need any more food. :) (He disagrees).

Also, just to be clear... this is for their enjoyment, and for professional reasons. My Lotto dream is to quit everything and live on a beach with them and a supermodel who's also incredibly kind, intelligent, witty, funny, sweet and perfect for me, and me for her. (I won the lottery in this scenario remember? It's possible. But I'd take a regular woman who ticks all those other boxes too. :) So if that's you, feel free to hit me up... ;) )

136,[Help] Pain-Induced Aggression in Dog,dogs,t3_a7ui4p,2,False,False,a7ui4p,"Hello,

I have a 2 year old Corgi/Lab mix who has recently injured herself in her paw. It was a very deep laceration which caused a lot of bleeding and pain. My family and I took her to the vet where she was quite aggressive and nippy when they applied a bandage, and she is still very aggressive to us today. We can not approach her without growling or her trying to nip at us. She is very distrustful of anybody. This is especially problematic as she continues to chew on her bandage, preventing it from healing properly. We use a muzzle which helps calm her down and prevents her from biting, but is difficult to put on the dog, and becoming more difficult to put on overtime as she dislikes it. We also have a Elizabethan-style cone but it is a little short and our dog can still access her wound. 

The bandage is due to come off Saturday but this still has caused a lot of stress in my family. To give context - my dog has a history of resource-guarding with rawhide bones/treats and is excitable around strangers. I have been working on her around strangers and she is not ""aggressive""; rather just nips when she gets too excited. She is also very nervous around other dogs, especially when she is on a leash. She is better off leash around dogs but still distrustful. We bought her improperly using Kijiji and not analyzing her parents/her own behavior, but I really do not want to give up this dog from this bout of stress. 

Please reddit, how should I deal with this? I've been searching online but the only advice they give is to go to the vet and the pain will subside (which it obviously has not, even though she is on some painkillers). How do I prevent this behaviour in the future?

Does anyone have any ideas about how I could perhaps divide the back/trunk so that we could safely have both the dog and some stuff back there? Maybe some sort of cargo net rigging?

Thanks in advance!"
145,[Help] Dew nail looks lifted from the quick but no pain or blood?,dogs,t3_a7svwr,1,False,False,a7svwr,"I was cutting my dogs nails when I saw her dew nail looked weird. I'm assuming the smaller white nail is the quick and the large shell is what used to be her nail. The nail/shell is totally lifted from her quick.

She is not in pain. There is no blood. She is letting me touch it. It has been 2 weeks since I cut her nails and I have no idea when this happened. 

This was my first time cutting her nails. We always went to another place to get them cut. She is 1 year old tomorrow. She only just started letting us touch her arms and paws without squirming so this was the first time we could get her to sit still long enough to learn how to cut her nails without hurting her.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course its the holidays so all the vets near us are booked. The emergency clinic near us quoted us $200-$300 for the service which is less than our deductible with insurance.

Some friends are telling me about similar experiences (lifted nail, not cracked) and they just trimmed the nail and left it. But I wanted to hear some other input so I can make the right decision.

On one hand I don't want to spend money on something unnecessary because I'm being over protective. But on the other I don't want to let my finances be the cause of a larger issue."

* What are the pros, cons, is it intimidating having your dog jump and latch onto your arm? 
* Did you do it for fun, did you compete?
* Is this something I can do with a still relatively young dog? (she just turned one year, but she was spayed super young so I don't want to do anything that will put too much pressure on her joints yet)
* What should I work on before starting the beginner's class?
* Is it all corrections-based? (this is something I will ask the clubs, but curious to see if the sport has moved toward a balanced approach)

I'm thinking about this, disc, or agility in the spring to start. She's a fairly confident dog, loves using her nose and her obedience training is going well. She's a shepherd mix, is pretty laid back, loves to use her mouth while we play, doesn't go over threshold unpredictably."
147,[Help] 1yr old Rottweiler refuses to put weight on rear leg.,dogs,t3_a7ujwa,17,False,False,a7ujwa,"**Edit: As I feared, it's her CCL. She'll be having a CORA Based Leveling Osteotomy in about a month (the surgeon is booked out). On the bright side, I'm in a place where I can afford the surgery, and it's winter so I won't feel too bad keeping her cooped up for recovery. It's her birthday today, so once her sedatives wear off, I'm going to make her a kibble cake with some bacon.

**I have already made an appointment with our vet for tomorrow**

I took my 1 year old, 95lb (yeah, I know she's bordering on too big for a girl, but she came from questionable origins) Rottweiler to the park today to finally enjoy the unseasonably warm (46F) weather. She went into heat over Thanksgiving, so we haven't been able to go for nearly a month. During that time we took a few walks and ran around the backyard and in the house, so while not as active as before (we would hit the park 3-5x per week, plus walks) she wasn't completely sedentary either.

 When we got there, we were the only ones so she was able to walk/trot around to check out the smells and warm up slowly. A short while later a young mastiff showed up to play, and they hit it off, lumbering around like big dogs will do. They played for a while, then each went off on their own to check things out. Soon my dog initiated play again, and as she was coming back from around the trees, she let out a little whine and raised her rear paw. I went to her to check it out. She let me move her leg, no reaction at the hip or knee, but didn't want me to check her feet. There was a dime sized drop of blood on the snow. She took a few steps, and would just touch the very tips of her toes to the ground.  I carried her (a ridiculous sight I'm sure, since I've only got her by 30lbs) to the entrance gates, ran to get the car, and took her home. 

Once home, she was very eager to get out of the car and into the yard. Still limping, but wanting to sniff around and mark her spots. Headed inside, she didn't let her sore leg slow her down going up the stairs. I got her to lie down and let me check her out. After an initial warning groan, she let me feel out her foot and I didn't find anything unusual. I gave her meal (appetite is as good as ever) and crated her. I've been taking her out every couple of hours to see how she moves. She is still reluctant to put any weight on the leg, but is determined to still get into things, climb onto the couch, and sneak bites of food from the bag. She will sit normally (sloppy puppy sit to either side), and is willing to lie on either side as well.  She just will not put her foot all the way on the ground. My late, smaller, Rottie was prescribed Piroxicam (an NSAID) for arthritis and cancer pain, so I gave her one to help her be comfortable for tonight. 

I guess what I'm wondering is, has anyone had any experience with similar symptoms? And what was the diagnosis?  I'm thinking maybe a CCL, though that wouldn't explain the drop of blood (I did find small, fresh scab on her neck, though, so the blood may be unrelated), or possibly an issue with her toe/toenail since she didn't want me poking around her feet. It's also possible I missed and injury between the toes.

TL;DR Young dog is limping, wondering what it could be. Will see vet first thing tomorrow."

154,"[help] Need help about a puppy in the care of someone maybe not worthy? Bad title, read in for details.",dogs,t3_a7trj1,5,False,False,a7trj1," 

Okay, I know this won't necessarily be the best place for this, and redirection to the best sub will be welcomed...

And please, helpful advice only... we're truly worried about this.

Story:  Our Golden Doodle girl had nine puppies, but while we are not breeders,  we did all we could to make sure they were healthy and as importantly;  that they went to good families.  We asked for a fair price, and  everyone paid accordingly... except one .. she asked us if we could  split as she was looking for a good puppy for her 8yo son, who has a  medical condition (won't specify) and needed a therapy type dog....  and  she was only shy $50.  We wrote up an agreement to have the other  portion paid by the end of this month (December).

We waited 18 days to send out one reminder text, as we wanted to wait long enough but also not annoy during the actual holidays.

My wife and her became friends on FB.

Tonight, we found out first that she had deleted her... and at first did not reply to my text.

That's a concern... but it's nothing compared to what we discovered next.

The  woman is now under investigation for 'allegedly accidentally' running  her child over in a school parking lot (caught on camera).  The boy is  currently in critical condition.  This happened 8 days ago.

She  did respond to my wife and said she had deleted a lot of people out of  embarrassment and don't believe everything you see or read.  She said  the puppy was with her daughter over at her Sister's house.  This  suggests that she had her other child removed from the home.  She has  sent further texts discussing getting our address for the $ and talked  about the puppy, but we are greatly concerned.

What we would like to get out of this is:

1. the  agreement was full payment by Dec 31st, or we have the right to reclaim  the puppy.  We don't expect to receive the $.  The mother is out on  $10,000 bond at the moment.
2. We  are more concerned about the child, and if he pulls through, we would  prefer that he not only keeps the puppy but that the little one helps  him recuperate.... we have no desire to separate them.
3. Caveat:  We are now extremely concerned about the mind set of the mother, and  what other things could happen... and since we are only allowed to  contest the welfare of the puppy; if we should consider pursuing trying  to reclaim her.

So,  right now the situation seems to be that she wrecklessly drove her car  in the parking lot, knowing full well her son was outside the car  (hanging onto the door handle) and that he was run over in the  process... we have a puppy in their care that is still in the process of  being paid for.. and we have written contracts stating that full  payment must be received for her to claim full ownership.  We want the  boy to have a fur friend forever, ad we want that forever to be.. a very  long time... but we also love the little pup and wonder if we should  try to get her back .. especially before something happens to her.

Thoughts and advice, please.

Much thanks."
155,"[Help] After months, my rescue dog still stays under the bed in our spare room about 90% of the time. Lately I've had limited success in getting her out a little more, but could really use some ideas! Thanks!",dogs,t3_a7nlsf,19,False,False,a7nlsf,"Darla came to us 10 months ago. We've only had golden retrievers before and she's our first rescue. She is a big girl, shepard mix, who was dumped after giving birth. She'd been at the shelter for about a month when we brought her home. She gets along fine with our golden and they are about the same age - 4 years old.  I suspect she wasn't so much abused as neglected. She didn't know what dog biscuits were, didn't know how to ride in a car, didn't know how to PLAY, at all. She fundamentally doesn't understand about play (and gets stressed at the dog park when dogs chase one another).  She's a little more aggressive in that situation and very protective of our other dog.

She spends 90% of her day in the bedroom that is in the far corner of the house, somehow cramming herself under the bed. I set up a crate for her and have tried other ""cavelike"" setups to help her feel at home, but she likes that spot. I thought that she might come out of it after a bit, but she hasn't really. Just lately, I've tried anew. I'll call her upstairs and give her lots of approval and when she tries to leave, I call her back and give her a treat.  Rinse and repeat.  By doing this, I've gotten her to stay with the rest of us for an hour, which is huge for her.  My question is -  if she wants to be the goth kid and have a lot of alone time, should I be messing with it? It seems to me that dogs are social creatures and she'd be happier if she learned to be part of us. Should I keep rewarding her just for hanging out with us? Are there better rewards than food rewards?  (Or is there a better approach to bringing her out of her shell?  We've tried blocking off the 'hideout' room and she just seems unhappy and anxious, so we stopped.)

Thanks so much for your help."
156,"[Discussion] Take it from me, don't adopt two puppies from the same litter.",dogs,t3_a7boq1,292,False,False,a7boq1,"tl;dr - Littermate syndrome is a very real thing and can stress you and your new family members out.

I did my research and asked the appropriate questions prior to deciding to adopt a dog from a breeder. I was informed to stay away from the idea of getting two puppies from the same litter, but told myself that my wife and I would be the exception. We were not an exception.

Feelings started to take over when visiting the breeder and interacting with the puppies. We went from ""1 only"" to ""Why not both?"" quickly. Puppies and their cuteness have a way of convincing you. We even asked the breeder about how close the siblings were and were told that they act independently. We took somebody for their word and got burned.

While I don't feel angry at the breeder as they're relatively new (comparatively) but have had positive results with their work among other people.

We knew we were going to have to remove any chance of Littermate Syndrome forming, or reducing its effect. Since first day we brought them home we decided to walk them separately and the other one will go into panic mode. This includes barking, howling, whining, urinating, pooping, you name it. It doesn't stop either, it will go on as long as the other is gone despite if another human is the house. This is limited to walking, but even being created in separate rooms, separate crates in the same room, or just simply being in separate rooms with no way to get to the other. While social with other dogs and people, you can sense an alarming amount of hesitation. The amount of anxiety was beyond anything we've ever since in dogs. We realized we had fucked up.

We've since decided to return one of the puppies to the breeder. We understand we do not have the time with our current schedules to devote to breaking this strong bond they have with each other. Let alone training them which would require them to separate AND together. It was a mistake, an expensive one at that, but it will become unreal for what damage it can cause to each other, us, and others. I can only hope that the other puppy can find a forever home that can meet it's needs. I can also hope that the breeder will change their practice of adopting out their litters since this was made aware to them.

For those considering adopting two puppies from the same litter, please take a moment. Think to yourself if you have the time to meet all of the needs it will require of you. Unless you are a very well experienced trainer, I would highly suggest not doing so."
157,[Help] Terrible first fostering experience. Am I crazy?,dogs,t3_a7tdco,0,False,False,a7tdco,"This is a little long, so TLDR: My SO and I are finishing up fostering a dog for the first time, and it's been a nightmare. Are we being crazy and expecting too much from the foster organization?

SO: My partner and I have been wanting a dog for ages, and we finally moved into a place with a nice backyard and a reasonable pet deposit. We were a little nervous about going full commitment to a dog, so when an opportunity came up to foster a ~1 year old beagle mix it seemed like a great idea.

From the start, though, it has just been an incredibly stressful and un-fun experience. We work opposite schedules generally, and there are only 2-3 days a week where the dog would need to be crated for at most 8 hours (we are sometimes able to come back for a walk at lunch, but not always). We were told by the rescue that the dog's previous foster worked similar hours so it would not be an issue. From the start, however, whenever we left her alone she would be obviously stressed out and break out of her crate. The rescue gave us some info on crate training but after a few weeks of that there was no improvement and the dog was getting even more stressed out. It is also worth noting that the dog only had these problems when we left, otherwise she was perfectly content to sleep in her crate and went in voluntarily very often. She howls incessantly during the day, according to our neighbor. When the rescue got us a gate and suggested we try gating her in a room, she tore down the sturdy gate. She has scratched the hell out of exit doors in our house (the front/back doors she sees us walk out of).

Some of the chaos she's caused when alone is just inexperience. Every time we come home and find something chewed up, it's a new lesson in puppy-proofing the house, and that's fine and to be expected. But the rescue kept blowing off the clear *symptoms* (not necessarily officially diagnosable behavior) of separation anxiety. We understand that many rescue dogs go through a decompression phase and that the amount of time can vary drastically, but this dog is incredibly stressed out when left alone and even if it is a temporary problem, she deserves help getting through it. We are more than happy to help her but we have never done this before and need help ourselves as we do not know how to approach the problem. Our inexperience and need for help should any issues arise was made abundantly clear when we were asked to foster (the president of the rescue asked us to help out, which we were happy to do since we were considering it anyway). No matter how much we asked for help, we rarely get an answer.

We had previously looked at adopting an adorable malamute mix with separation anxiety, and decided against it because we thought our first dog having anxiety issues would be a bad idea as we were not confident about our ability to properly handle it without any experience. Again, I totally get that it's way too early to diagnose anything, but after weeks of dealing with howling and scratching and chewing and getting silence, if anything, from the rescue I was ready to go insane. 

It really just comes down to the lack of communication - and this is where my main question is. What sort of help do you expect from a rescue organization when fostering a dog from them? I know they're probably dealing with a million other things and may not have time to walk a pair of panicking first-time foster parents through how to handle anxiety symptoms, but I feel like we were crazy for asking for help so many times. We had larger problems getting things they said they would provide for us - a lead for our backyard, harness to help with her pulling, some more durable chew toys - but again I have no idea if those are things a rescue will typically provide or if they're supposed to come out of our pocket. The rescue told us they would be providing anything we needed but the only things they have actually delivered on are a gate and food.

Are we crazy and needy? Was it just a shitty situation, having two people who couldn't have someone home at all times handling a dog who hated being alone? "

159,[Help] [Breed] Help finding the ideal dog breed for someone who is really active but works most of the day.,dogs,t3_a7r2gd,2,False,False,a7r2gd,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

  * I really like the look of Spitz type dogs due to the upright ears and pointed snouts.
  * Large sized.

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I am wondering if there are dishes, bowls that will be easier for him to eat or drink from – note that he cannot really raise himself up on his front Legs into a sitting position either. 

What about carts? Two- and four-wheel wheelchairs for dogs? Is anything that he could use where he could remain prone, remain in that cart, move himself around, and still stay  comfortable?

I’m also wondering, hoping, if any of you have known a dog who has pulled his hip out and the doctor said it couldn’t be put back in, and if there was any solution. Right now it seems like there isn’t one. I really hope my doctors are wrong.

I just feel really guilty about leaving her then returning and leaving again. But what worries me more  is she's now used to having lots of people around her and when I bring her across it'll just be me and her and I'll hire a dog walker  for when im at work but I'm wondering is if this is fair ?

My parents are close to 70 so they couldn't look after her long term despite the fact they love her to death and dad walking her has really improved his health. They have arthritis so haven't been good at keeping up with her brushing as she has am insanely thick coat she looks like a Swedish lapphund despite being a street dog from Cyprus so I've been paying for monthly dog grooming appointments. Realistically they cannot care for her adequately long term.

Do you think it's best that I bring her with me in March or do you think she would be happier surrounded by more people and staying with my parents ? 

I would love her to be with me as she really improves my welbeing and I can tell she loves me the most but is it fair to deprive her from all of the people just to be with me ? 

She likes beinf by herself a lot and finds a quiet place in the house to sleep so I think she will be ok when I'm at work and have a dog walker mid way through the day.

166,[Vent] I feel like there's something psychologically wrong with people who dislike dogs,dogs,t3_a7zmfr,1,False,False,a7zmfr,"I know they say people who don't like dogs are wired differently than those who do. But I've met a ton of people who do and don't have dogs... They aren't so different. However I've also met many people who HATE dogs too. They sincerely dislike dogs and the idea of a dog somehow disgusts them.

Without fail, the dozen or so people I've met who are dog haters have some kind of psychological problem. They aren't normal people.

Not like they were traumatized by dogs...but more like they have insecurity problems and almost fear dogs will somehow compete with them. Ironically doh dislikes are boring as hell and a dog would make them interesting.... Strange how they fear a dog's competition against their boring lives. 

The quality I found most common among dog haters is their passive nature for life. They all tend to share a similar trait in that they are extremely boring and not someone you could or would want to talk to. They had low expectations in life and were very consumed with themselves and being the center of attention anywhere they go... Ironically they were often too boring to be the center of attention anywhere they go... But they still tried like hell.

Every dog hater I've met is insanely boring, spoiled, insecure or all three. It's like these are prerequisites for disliking dogs. 

I was thinking about this the other day and have come to the conclusion that the all the people I've met didn't like dogs all shared these traits. Almost as if they were worried a dog would take away from their own attempts at trying to be interesting and not boring... I met around a dozen peoole like this in my lifetime and every single one had these traits... I call it the ""mediocre but in  denial"" quality.

It's so bizarre and quite sad. When someone doesn't like dogs, to me, that's like saying they don't like chocolate.

But I've found these people are so because of their own deep seeded insecurities... Non dog owners are boring as hell to me but people who dislike dogs altogether are psychologically damaged in my experience.... If they did a study I bet they would prove this.

Since college I realized I met exactly 14 people who hated dogs and would never even consider getting one
... No allergies or anything like that. Just super boring, spoiled, or insecure.

I bet I'm not alone in this observation.... "

168,[Help] How to deal with a stubborn puppy?,dogs,t3_a7q5fr,14,False,False,a7q5fr,"Hi, I recently adopted my first 4 month old male puppy, that is a husky cross Pomeranian (Pomsky) 

I’ve had him just under a week and toilet training is going quite well, however I’ve noticed he can be rather stubborn. 

For example when on the lead and I pull him away from something I don’t want him to pay attention to (only a small tug on his harness and calling his name, no dragging whatsoever) such as something he should not be trying to eat, often he will respond by sitting or lying down and then refuses to move. 

Obviously I want to nip this behaviour in the bud and have him obey me when i want him to stop trying to eat something he shouldn’t or come to me. I have tried using a treat to distract him/get his attention to come to me but more often than not he is not interested as whatever I’m telling him not to eat is more appealing. 

How do you address this kind of behaviour? I am a novice dog owner and so would appreciate any advice 

Tl;dr: My dog will respond by sitting and refusing to move in protest of me trying to prevent him to eating/paying attention to things he shouldn’t, how do I get him to stop this and listen to me? "
169,[Help] I'm afraid I'm not giving my pup the love and attention it deserves.,dogs,t3_a7on45,15,False,False,a7on45," I'm a highschool student with a busy schedule, and so I made the STUPID decision of getting a puppy, thinking I had everything planned out perfectly. I guess not.  
 The puppy is about 3 months old, and it hasn't gotten all of the vaccines required to go out yet, so it's inside the house full time. We also have a crate. Since I gotta go to school, my mum lets the dog out of the crate to run freely around the house for about 3 hours. Sometimes, we let it run around the huge balcony, and it has a blast up there. But, it has to go back to the crate for 1-2 hours so that my mother can do some house chores without being afraid of smacking the puppy across the face with a broom.  
 When I come home, I make sure I give it a lot of attention for at least 1 hour before I study. After I go up to my room to study, it usually remains out of the crate for another hour, until we're all busy doing afternoon stuff, so no one can look out for it. In the evening, it gets some more time with us outside the crate, until it's late and we gotta go to sleep.  
 Not counting bedtime, it gets about 4-6 hours of crate time daily. Not all in one go, of course. Is that bad? Should it not be there that long? Am I doing a bad job? :c"
170,[Breed] [Help] Pitbull lover looking to adopt my own dog - I want a dog that I can rely to be non-aggressive and that would be ok around cats,dogs,t3_a7rz6p,26,False,False,a7rz6p,"** Update: Thank you for all of your responses. They’ve all been incredibly helpful. 

I’ve been giving it a lot of thought and have decided that I am going to look at local rescues for the breeds other people have suggested. That said, I am not going to *completely* rule out pits either.  Instead, I’m just going to wait for the right individual dog and reach out to the rescues to find an older dog that is really happy living with cats and gets along well with other dogs. 

Whichever dog I get, I’ll be sure it’s one that I know I can give the adequate amount of exercise, training, &amp; attention to. I feel comfortable that I am a responsible dog owner and someone who puts a great deal of thought before putting an animal in any situations that might be stressful (or just new &amp; exciting) - so will just need to be honest with myself if I will be happy making the type of adjustments I may need for whichever individual dog I adopt. (I’m recognizing there are trade-offs and I may not be able to find everything I want in one dog, which is ok too.)  

I also think I may get a cat first so that I can remove the “it’s really lonely without having a pet for the first time in 28 years” factor from the equation. That will make it a bit easier to allow myself the time to find the perfect dog, even if it makes introducing them a little more challenging for me.

Filling out the questionnaire was a *really* helpful exercise towards really being honest with myself about the time &amp; energy commitment I’m able to make. I hope every prospective dog owner takes the time to do this, even if they think they know what breed they want. **

*eta: I seem to have messed up the formatting - I’m on the mobile app &amp; am not sure how to fix it 😕*

Hi r/dogs! I‘ve lost both my cat &amp; my dog in the past year and am ready to bring some new life into my life. 

The thing is, pitbulls have been my favorite breed since I was a kid (30+ years ago) and I’m having a hard time opening myself to any other breeds. (I’ve filled out the breed questionnaire below) 

I’m not at all against getting a pitbull, but the one I lived with ended up being euthanized after he attacked/mauled his owner on 3 occasions (we think he was protecting me). I don’t want to get into graphic detail, but it’s the most violence I’ve seen in my life &amp; I still have nightmares from it a year later. (please don’t judge me - it was not my dog and I tried to handle it as responsibly as possible, given I was not its owner).  

It wasn’t entirely out of the blue, the dog had been reactive towards its owner on past occasions, and my sense is there may have been some abuse going on (this person is no longer in my life). He (the dog) had also been on Prozac that the owner decided to stop giving him &amp; discontinued without consulting a vet or going through a weaning process. 

They’re still my favorite breed and I’m not afraid to be around pitbulls (I still felt safe having the other pitbull sleep with me even after the attacks), but it’s made me a little anxious about living with one (I live by myself and am smallish and female). I’m worried it will “turn on me” or hurt my (future) cat.  

Can you help offer some suggestions that might open up some other options for me or ways to be sure I’m adopting a dog whose temperament I can rely on? 

Top priority is being able to have my dog share a home with a cat and no aggression towards people or other dogs. I’m open to adopting an older dog (5-6 yrs old) 

Thank you! 

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I had a pit bull basically dumped on me when its owner left town for a year. He was not an easy dog; I was not prepared to be a dog owner, but I did my best and made sure he was loved and well-cared for (but admittedly was in over my head - he definitely was not a “first time dog” kind of dog). I lived with the dog for almost 3 years, part of the time his owner lived with me. 

That said, I don’t have any experience training dogs. There was a weird dynamic with my last dog since he wasn’t really “my” dog and his owner was weird about not wanting the dog to like me better than him -  kind of an “all the responsibility, none of the authority” situation. (I sometimes refer to the dog as “my dog” since it sounds less confusing). As mentioned above, things took a really bad turn. 

(Despite the challenges, I absolutely loved that dog with all my heart and he’s the reason I want to get a dog.)

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescue. I get the value of going to a reputable breeder, but my passion is animal rescue, so I don’t think I’d be comfortable buying a dog. (It will be an older dog; not a puppy) 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* The most important qualities: Non-aggressive &amp; able to be trusted with a cat. 

Easy going, loving, likes to snuggle. 
Has the energy to do easy hikes, walks, etc. but won’t lose their mind if exercise is offset by mental stimulation. The type of dog you can bring for a walk with your friend’s dog or take to a dog-friendly cafe/bar. Derpy goofball is a bonus. 

Fairly low maintenance. One that has an average or longer-than-average life span (I just lost 2 pets in the past year)  

I’m kind of a tactile person, so maybe not so crazy about a scruffy dog if it’s fur isn’t soft to touch. (Not a deal breaker though) 

No bulging eyes or snorting breathing.

A dog who is solid &amp; can make me feel safe.  

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Staffies/Pitbulls - I love their derp factor, that they have the energy for active stuff but are also couch potatoes, that they’re such snugglebugs, &amp; their fat heads. I also feel safer home alone &amp; out walking with them.

I also like border collies, Australian Shepard’s, German Shepards, lab mixes, standard poodles, and any sort of medium to large scruffy/shaggy dogs (but from what I’ve read about the breeds, worry they may be either too high strung, energetic, easily bored, or have high prey drives) 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience commands for its safety &amp; mine (sit, stay, come, drop), fun stuff like “high five” would be nice but not necessary. Ideally, I’d like to eventually train it to be a psychiatric service dog, so Canine Good Citizen skills, DPT, blocking and guiding me to nearest exit (this isn’t a deal breaker for me though)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I’ll be spending most hours of the day with my dog. I’m home almost all day and will bring the dog with me when possible. I figure the training is kind of an all-day, all-the-time thing, but am figuring 1.5 - 3 dedicated hours of quality time (focused on what the dog wants/needs) a day (including walking &amp; grooming). 

I also plan on going to obedience training and maybe agility training (only for fun &amp; to keep the dog happy, not competing or anything)

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* At least one hour (2 half hour walks) each day. The type of exercise would depend on the dog - beach, hiking trails, using my bike or a scooter alongside it if its energy level exceeds mine. If I’m honest with myself, it’s not so much a matter of how much time I have, it’s a motivation issue - part of why I want a dog is because it forces me to get out of my house. I’m in decent physical shape so can handle the extra exercise. 

The dog park makes me a little anxious to be honest.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I’m fine with trimming hair &amp; nails, giving baths, and cleaning ears. If the dog loves getting brushed, I’ll brush it daily - but don’t want a dog that will have issues with its coat if I miss a few days.

I’d prefer not to have the added expense of needing a professional groomer but it’s not a deal-breaker. I’m also fine with trimming its fur myself if that’s a thing. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* medium to smaller end of large - I don’t really like small dogs (I mean, they’re fine for other people). I like a dog who’s got enough weight that it calms me when we snuggle on the couch. My place isn’t huge, so a super large dog isn’t ideal. My 75lb pit bull was fine in here, but I probably would prefer a dog closer to 50lbs so that I can lift it or carry it if safety or health issues require it.  

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I’m not a fan of shedding. I don’t mind hair getting on the furniture, but ideally, I don’t want a dog that sheds all over anyone who visits or that my carpet is covered with hair if I don’t vacuum daily. Barking depends on the circumstance. I live in an end unit on a busy street, so barking every time someone passes outside would get old. Barking non stop when left alone would be an issue too, since I live in an apartment. I get that dogs bark - I just don’t want it excessive/constant. (Yipping is out. I don’t have a high tolerance for dogs that yip). Slobber is yucky, but dogs drool. I’m not a huge fan of feeling like I need a towel every time I pet it, but my last dog had issues with licking his paws and I’m used to giant wet spots on the couch. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It’s not vital, but I feel like it would open up more opportunities for playing/exercising since I don’t have a yard. At the very least, I’d like a dog I could train to be let off leash for safety issues (like if I dropped the leash or it got out or something) 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I don’t know if I have a strong preference on this - I want a dog that wants to be with me, but I’m fine if it is happy to just be in the same room doing its own thing. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking when someone comes to the door is fine; not barking is fine too.      I don’t want a dog that will be reactive/aggressive with strangers &amp; visitors. As long as the dog can be trained to go to their pillow or their crate &amp; settle down, I don’t have a strong preference. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. This is a dealbreaker. I have too much anxiety around my dog hurting someone else’s dog. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Any sort of aggression. As mentioned above, dog I lived with ended up being euthanized after attacking his owner and I still have a lot of anxiety around something like that happening. Plus I don’t want a dog that I can’t trust around an indoor cat (will make sure the cat has “escape routes”, etc., but it’s still a concern I have)

Yipping or non-stop talking/barking. (Walter the French Bulldog is adorable to watch in a 2 minute video, but I’d lose my shit dealing with that all day long) 

I’d like to avoid a dog that is prone to “piddling” whenever they get excited. 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Generally no more than 1-2 hours at a time a few days a week. Maybe 4-5 hours once or twice a week (if I take a class or go to a movie or dinner with friends). 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* It’s just me. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I plan to get a cat/kitten 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Breed/weight restrictions are not a concern. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* There aren’t any breed laws in my city

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* generally between 70-85° except during heat waves. I think it sometimes drops to 50° at night in the winter (I’m in SoCal) 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* 

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

How much does breed matter if you are getting a mixed breed from a shelter or rescue? 

Is there an age after which a dog’s temperament is considered a “known” or can a dog become aggressive without prior signs of aggression?

171,[Vent] [Discussion] Why is it so hard to find good dog food?!,dogs,t3_a7po6x,23,False,False,a7po6x,"After a year of awful digestive issues and trying several different foods I was finally able to find a food that didn't bother my dog's stomach. Well fast forward two years and now my vet is telling me to switch my dog onto a new grain-inclusive food with the new DCM research. My vet didn't specify any brands, just to avoid grain-free varieties and newer brands. From what I've seen online it seems like most people recommend Royal Canin, Hills Science Diet, and Purina, but a look at the ingredients lists for all three brands makes me wary.

Royal Canin (Large Adult) has chicken by-product meal as the first ingredient.

Hills Science Diet (Advanced Fitness Variety) has pea fiber as the second ingredient , whereas other varieties have corn/corn meal high up on the ingredients list.

Purina Pro Plan (Bright Mind Chicken and Rice) has poultry by-product meal and corn gluten meal in the first five ingredients

WHYYYY is it so hard to find a dog food that has a specified protein source as one of the top ingredients without by-product meals and questionable fillers as the next ingredients? Has anyone found the holy grail of dog food? If so, you deserve all the awards.

173,[help] trying to play with my dog,dogs,t3_a7pcf7,4,False,False,a7pcf7,"5 months ago I adopted a 4 year old Red Heeler. 

About once a week he will get into a weird mood where he constantly paws at me, and boops(punches) me with his nose. I'll try to play with him with toys, but he'll start ignoring the toy after 10 seconds. This devolves into 20 minutes of belly rubs before he finally calms down. 

He usually does this not long after a walk, so I don't think he wants to go out. I've never had a dog do this before, but I've also never had a heeler. 

Any suggestions about what he is doing or wants? is this totally normal, and I should just accept my new life as Official Belly Rubber?"
174,[Help] the high prey drive dog I'm adopting is also extremely shy,dogs,t3_a7rgic,5,False,False,a7rgic,"I adopted my dog from a breeder (who lives in a rural area) when she was 5 months old. When I brought her home to the city it took her a little while to get acclimated to the sounds of cars starting unexpectedly and just being in a more noisy environment, but has done great. She loves all other animals and though it takes her a little while to warm up to new people, she loves them after getting used to them. I socialized her a lot as a pup and she's great in any situation I've put her in. She's a complete sweetheart. 

The breeder had kept her littermate sister, but soon after we picked up our girl, breeder ended up getting sick with a chronic and potentially terminal illness that required her to travel a lot out of the area for treatment.  I dont want to make any assumptions, but I am guessing the other puppy was not socialized properly due to the breeder being so ill. I met both puppies together and both were friendly and sweet at 5 months old. So,  the breeder said she was putting up my dog's sister for adoption (now 2 y/o), and I was immediately interested. The breeder said she had high prey drive and was shy which I thought about and decided that was something I could handle. After talking to her again she stressed that the dog isnt just shy, but extremely shy. She isnt at all aggressive, but will cower when meeting new people if her owner isnt present. She does great at home and loves being around her people and is fine when new people come over as long as her owner is there, but isnt great in new environments. She also said she will be better in an environment with another dog. 

I have never had an extremely shy dog before. It sounds like she may also be codependent. I feel like the reason she is so shy is possibly due to neglect, which breaks my heart. I think I still want to give it a trial run, is this crazy? Any advice from people with shy rescues? I am willing to get a trainer and do what it takes, but I really dont know what to expect. My first instinct was to try and socialize her, but after some internet research the best thing is to take it very slow? I also want to add my first priority is providing a safe and happy home for the dog I currently have, will bringing a shy dog home have any impact on her? "
175,[Help] Advice for Integrating my New Puppy,dogs,t3_a7r94l,2,False,False,a7r94l,"Hi All- I have just introduced a new French Bulldog puppy (12 weeks old), Frankie, into my home where I have a 1.5 yr old male French Bulldog named Biscuit. Neither are neutered. Whenever I first got Biscuit my vet in Seattle, who specializes in the breed, recommended that we not neuter him until he is 2 yrs to ensure that his muscles and bone development aren't stunted before he has fully filled out. Biscuit is super personable and friendly- including with other dogs. After bringing Frankie home to meet Biscuit for the first time this past Saturday- Biscuit was very apprehensive and confused. He barked and snapped at Frankie several times so I put Frankie inside a small crate and left it in the living room so that Biscuit could get used to his smell, presence etc. I would take Frankie out every so often and let them further socialize. It seemed to have worked and after 48 hours they are playing like best buds however Biscuit still has moments where he snaps at Frankie causing him to yelp, cry and run and hide, which breaks my heart to see. When Biscuit does this I spray him with water bottle and say a firm NO BITING. Biscuit runs off, hides as he knows he did something bad. I'm on Day 5 now and while they are playing, I don't trust leaving them unsupervised as I worry Biscuit will snap/bite him again and not be reprimanded. Any tips or tricks that you all can provide me for breaking Biscuit of his snappy tendencies? He usually snaps at Frankie over toys or treats. I am thinking of having Biscuit neutered asap but worry that this could throw the balance of power off between him and the new puppy since Frankie won't be neutered until he fills out. Any help is appreciated! I've heard e-collars are a good technique but I don't like the idea of shocking Biscuit to cause pain, which is why I use a water bottle. Thanks in advance."
176,[Help] Alternatives to Koha Stew?,dogs,t3_a7qujj,2,False,False,a7qujj,"We adopted our first dog a couple months ago, a chihuahua mix. Because of his few and weak teeth, his foster fed him Koha Stew because it was wet and she’s all about healthy eating for her and her dogs. It was on sale where she bought it so we bought a couple of pallets full (12 cans) in addition to the one she gave us. We’re looking for a cheaper alternative. 

All this to say, what’s the best wet food for dogs without many teeth? Preferably similar in taste to Koha. Can anyone vouch for the Publix premium brand ‘dog food in gravy’?"
177,[Discussion] What kind of collar can I get for my dog with lots of loose neck skin?,dogs,t3_a7qn03,4,False,False,a7qn03,"I just adopted a dog named Zoe. She's some kind of mutt with a ton of extra loose neck skin. 

Generally she wears her harness on walks, but I'd like for her to wear a collar with her tags in case she gets loose. Regular nylon or leather collars that you can get from like PetCo seem to pull all of her skin in one way or another unless it is so loose that she could easily shake it off. I don't want her to be uncomfortable, look weird, or get grossness in her neck skin as a result of the collar, though.

179,[Help] How long is too long to walk a large breed puppy? (4 months),dogs,t3_a7q3j4,7,False,False,a7q3j4,"I see a lot of guidelines like ""5 minutes per month of age twice daily"", but 20 minutes twice a day doesn't seem like nearly enough for our aussie/golden retriever mix. If I took her in after 20 minutes, she'd still be bouncing off the walls. But if I let her set the pace on our walk or take her to the dog park, it's an hour-long walk before she finally slows down.  


I know Aussies are bred to run around all day herding sheep, and she got quite a few aussie traits, but she'll be a larger dog (65-70lbs) and I'm worried about hurting her joints/bone development if I let her exercise until she's tired while she's this young. But honestly... 20 minutes twice a day just really doesn't seem like enough to tire her out so she can chill out with us in the evenings, and it takes about 10 minutes just to get to the off-leash area near our house. Am I causing more damage than good by letting her stay out this long, or is it ok since she's setting her own pace?"

182,[HELP] Is my puppy playing normally?,dogs,t3_a7pi6h,9,False,False,a7pi6h,"I live in an apartment with my 6.5 month old puppy. Our neighbours across the hall from us also have a puppy who is a bit older - we got our puppy after they had theirs. It worked out nicely because their puppy had all of their vaccination shots when we got our puppy, so they have been playing with each other since we got him. Lately I have been concerned that they are playing with each other properly, though. My puppy does not interact with any other dog/puppy the way that he does with her and my neighbours say the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

When we go to take our puppies out and see each other the dogs go crazy. They are always begging and whining at each others doors to play. When they do get together it's just constant growling and snarling at each other. My neighbours female dog is mostly the submissive one and will often roll onto her back with my puppy on top of her. They bite at each others neck/face/ears, but generally they do not cry out anymore in pain (they used to as younger puppies, but now it's just the growling and snarling). Sometimes my puppy will be more interested in looking for things to eat off the ground so he will ignore my neighbours puppy, which pisses her off and she will keep trying to bite and instigate more playing. Other times they will ignore each other alltogether and just lay on the ground hanging out.  


Is this normal puppy playing? I know it likely is - they just sound so aggressive and vicious when they are playing. With other dogs my puppy will be more submissive and will often jump up to try and lick the other dog's face. I have seen him playing very gently with smaller puppies before and he is absolutely submissive with bigger dogs - he will usually adopt the playful bowing pose.

185,[Discussion] Destructive pup,dogs,t3_a7p5r9,6,False,False,a7p5r9,"So I've got 2 dogs, one of which is about 11 month old boxer-pit. She is relatively destructive as of late.

We used to lock them in the kitchen, with access to the yard when my wife and I would go to work (~8 hours alone). They were doing well, so I gave them access to the rest of the house. The pitbull-boxer would find anything on the table she could get at and destroy it. No problem, nothing on the table. I like the excuse to keep it clean. However, she has started destroying my couch now. Both pillows gone, and now she's progressively tearing apart the fabric on the side of the couch, so I set up a camera to watch. I leave around 0700 and she looks on the table, finds nothing, then goes to sleep on the couch. Around 0900-1000 daily, she and the other dog start playing, and then she starts to tear at the couch. So now they are back to the kitchen. I tried putting dog beds in the kitchen for them, but they lasted one day before destruction.

So my question, is this separation anxiety? She doesn't start tearing apart the couch until about 2-3 hours after we leave, so I'm leaning toward not SA. Is this puppy phase that she'll grow out of? I do exercise them about 1 hour daily throwing the ball when I get home, so I don't think it's too little exercise. Would this be something that CBD treats could help?"

(jk on the murdering, of course)",dogs,t3_a7oru3,11,False,False,a7oru3,"Just to head off any breeding discussion or ""get her spayed"" advice, I'll start by saying that she is not a breeding prospect but I do plan to use her for a sport and our vet and trainer both suggested that we let her go through a heat or two before spaying her for developmental reasons. So, that's that.

Anyway, she's going CRAZY. She can already be a bit of an intense puppy (heeler mix) but this is insane, and I'm used to intense dogs. She wants to be with me all the time and even tries to climb on me while I'm working, despite never being particularly clingy before. She seems to have forgotten all of her commands. She had appropriate chewing down pat until she went into heat, and now she's eating my house. She's harassing my other dogs who she previously got along with just fine.

I'm obviously not really upset with her as I know those hormones are making her a little crazy and she can't help it. But I'm just wondering if there are any ways I can help her be a little more comfortable and calmer, aside from the usual stuff like exercise and training.

188,[Discussion] Dog Went Missing But Returned Under Kind Of Strange Circumstances,dogs,t3_a7kr77,6,False,False,a7kr77,"Maybe I'm overthinking it but just wanted to see what others thought.

My dog went missing, she was round my parents(they live round the corner), dog was in front garden, apparently my mum had stepped inside for a minute, came back out and she was gone.

This was really unlike her, she never likes to go to far from other people's sight. My mum thought she couldn't have gone far and went looking but with no luck.

She came and got me and before I knew it half the village was out looking for.

To absolutely no luck.

Around midnight I came home, at this point everyone in the village and Facebook knew and was watching out for her.

The whole situation just didn't make sense to me, she isn't the sort to wander off, she doesn't even chase cats. 

She also instantly responds to any kind of whistling, with half the village whistling for her.

Then at 1am I get a call, she's back! It was the greatest thing I had ever heard, it was true bliss.

Apparently my parents dog had started barking and she was at the front gate.

The weird part though was she was warm and dry, it was cold and had been raining several hours (stopped about an hour before finding her).

On top of this, my dogs not a barker and the front gate is far from their house, it seemed strange for my parents dog to just start barking.

End of the day I'm just glad she's back and I'm never letting her out of my sight again.

Most likely she just got lost but part of me wonders if someone could have taken her locally and then dropped her off when she became 'to hot to handle' or they saw she was spayed and had very unquie markings (she's very easy to identify).

Maybe I am overthinking it but one thing I will say that I've learnt, is you can never be too careful."

197,[Breeds] Thinking about getting a dog,dogs,t3_a7jwzo,11,False,False,a7jwzo,"Hi,

I've been putting some thought into getting a dog for the first time. I read the info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/first-time-dog-owner), and while I have a lot more planning to do and decisions to make before I go through with this, I was curious about what breeds, ages, sexes, and so on I should be considering. I'm making plans to ""test drive"" some of my friends' dogs, so maybe I'm jumping the gun a bit by posting here before I do that. Don't take me too seriously, but I'm interested in your opinions.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This would be my first dog

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I think I'd prefer to rescue, but I'm not opposed to a breeder. I'm actually interested in ""trying out"" an older dog that's already trained and a bit more mellow. I'd love to hear opinions about whether this is a good idea. I definitely *don't* want to deal with a dog that has major issues or will cost a fortune in healthcare. But I like the idea of a shorter, less high stakes, but still mutually beneficial relationship.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I'm not sure if this is realistic, but since you asked: A dog that could not rip up my house for 8 hours (more realistically, 4 since I live literally next door to my work and could let it out and even walk it during lunch. It would be capable of running at least 5 miles, hopefully it could do more as I got into running longer distances.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Australian Cattle Dog: Would be physically capable of running or hiking. Smart. Looks cool as fuck. Sounds like it could be difficult to deal with for a new owner though, particularly a younger dog.
* Malinois: Also looks cool.
* Golden Retriever: Seem to have a reputation for being easy to care for and train. Adorable.


5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Run with me
* Hike with me on multi-day camping trips (off leash would be kinda cool, but I'm not sure what the expert opinions are on that as far as ethics)
* I assume obedience is a given? I want to be able to take it out in public without endangering other people or the dog. I don't want a dog to be something I have to constantly worry about misbehaving.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Excluding exercise? Is it wildly unrealistic to say maybe .5 - 1 hour of direct interaction?

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I'd like it to be content with about an hour of jogging, 5 - 10 miles. I don't know a ton about dog parks but obviously I'm not opposed to the idea.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing is fine. If it's easy to groom at home I'd do it, otherwise I can afford to pay a pro.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* 50ish pounds or larger

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle shedding. Barking wouldn't be great, I like my neighbors. I'm not a huge fan of slobber.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I'd really like to be able to do this.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* No strong preference, they both have benefits

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I don't want it to suffer while I'm at work 40 hours a week, and I don't want it to kill my social life. I'd like to be able to go out once a week after work for say, 4 hours after walking the dog. And on the weekend I'd like to be able to spend one day without babysitting the dog other than taking it for a run at the end of the day. Are those reasonable expectations?

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* It's okay, perhaps even desired, if the dog barks a bit to let me know someone's there. I don't want it to jump on people out of joy, and I don't want it to growl at people and scare them away. Between those points I don't have a strong preference.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* It doesn't have to live with other dogs or kids, but it shouldn't act aggressive towards them out running or during brief visits.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Definitely no humping people. I fucking hate when peoples dogs do that to me.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I broke this down in detail in 13, but I work 40 hours a week (either 5 x 8 or 4 x 10). I live next to work, so I might even be able to get away with 2 half hour visits a day. I'd like to be able to spend one day of the weekend away from home the majority of the day. Hopefully taking the dog with me when I can, but sometimes I wouldn't be able to.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent. No breed or weight restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Warren, MI. I'm not aware of any, but I don't want a rottweiler or pit bull anyway so I doubt it matters.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* summer: 80f, winter: 30f

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

Do I have unrealistic expectations for the amount of care a dog would need?

Is a senior dog an okay idea? Would I be an awful person if I wasn't willing to spend more than say, $1000 on emergency or chronic medical issues (routine check ups or mild illness not included)?

Any great resources for first time dog owners? Obviously I'll research this myself as well, but it's always nice to get personal advice."

Our dog, Rex, has been going about 2x a week to a local doggy daycare facility. The employees are very pleasant and clearly enjoy having him there.

199,[Help] Ate a bunch of crackers?,dogs,t3_a7ifs3,13,False,False,a7ifs3,"Aghhh, today my dog somehow managed to get crackers off of a 5 foot tall table I never thought he could possibly get up to (in fact, I have suspicions the cat may have assisted him). Well, long story short he devoured them. Probably about 25 crackers. He doesn't eat human food often outside of the occasional spoonful of peanut butter. Should I be concerned?"
200,[help] Need reassurance that I’m making the right decision to euthanize my dog now,dogs,t3_a7kbah,6,False,False,a7kbah,"Hi everyone, I know this isn’t a fun topic at all but I appreciate those who are staying to listen to me and provide me some insight or advice. 



I have had a couple family dogs put down before. However, neither of them died from causes related to old age. One was injured and the other was struck with a sudden extreme illness. This is the first time I’m having to analyze our situation and try to make the best decision for my dog and my family. 



A little backstory, I adopted my dog about 3 years ago. He was anywhere from 7-9 years old at the time and is now anywhere from 10-12 years old. I adopted him due to his old age, he had been with the adoption agency for a while and I connected with him and wanted to make sure his last few years were happy and full of love. He has definitely had a wonderful and comfortable time with my family and I am so grateful for that. 



Well now for the issue at hand. I recently moved out of my house for college across town (about 30mins from home). And haven’t been able to be at home much. However in the amount of time I did see my dog and now that I’m home for the holiday I’ve seen some changes and decline in his behavior and health. 



He’s started vomiting, seemingly at random times. Has had a couple potty accidents in the house since I left. While he used to only have arthritis and slight dystrophy in his hind legs he now has it in his front legs as well. His hearing completely left in the 3 months I was at school. He’s developing cataracts. His teeth are terrible, they must be painful at this point although he still chews his food. I’m afraid he’s experiencing issues with his heart as he’s had trouble catching his breath, snores much louder now, and has started “hacking”. He’s had at least three tumors on his abdomen since I adopted him and they are much larger now (no biopsy but different vets have said they’re a probably just benign fatty tumors)



His behavior has also changed. He has started resource guarding to the point where my mom can’t enter her own bedroom to sleep with my father unless the dog doesn’t notice her come in. He cannot be groomed at all, by family or professionals. He snaps and runs away even when I try to do it. (When he was younger he let me shave and groom his entire body). He has become a lot more “pestery”, constantly asking my father for food while this previously was not a problem. 



My family will be going on vacation next week and the only person I trust to take care of him will also be out of town. I feel extremely uncomfortable boarding him as I know he is in pain and it would make him incredibly anxious. I’ve read probably 20 “how to know it’s time to put your dog to sleep” articles and they’ve all been pretty convincing at this point. I’m conflicted because while he has declined a lot in the past three months, he still is a very cheerful dog and still enjoys food and playing. At the same time, I know he’s in pain and I don’t want to wait until the last possible moment to make the decision because I don’t want him to suffer more than he has to. I also have to take my family into consideration as they have taken on responsibility for him. I do not want to burden them with my dogs accidents and behavior as he declines further. 



TLDR: My dog has considerably declined over the last three months. Though he still has a lively personality, I know he is in pain and  I do not want to wait until the last possible moment to euthanize him. "

I have been wanting a dog for my husband and I since we got married 4 years ago.  I am currently a nursing student and my husband is also a student (online) and also gets paid to work mostly from home. I currently have a month and a half off and thought that would be a good time to get a puppy and establish a schedule. My husband would mostly take over when I started school again (however, he has to move after he graduates this summer, while i stay with the dog to finish school). We got an awesome puppy 2 weeks ago but since we got him I have been questioning my decision. He is a possibly a corgi/aussie mix and for a puppy he is great. However, since getting him I have felt extremely stressed and over-emotional. I feel guilty and like a failure that I cant even take care of a puppy without getting so worked up and stressed. I got a puppy to feel less alone when my husband leaves but right now I feel more alone than before I got a puppy. I have tried and talk to my husband but he doesn't really say much. People get puppies all the time with no problems, why is it so hard for me? Has anybody else felt this way, how did you get over it?"

I’m suppose to be traveling to my families Thursday evening and a few of my family members are allergic to fleas. I also don’t want to bring fleas into a place with dogs so they spread even more.

205,"[Help] Advice on how to proceed with a blind, deaf, senior beagle",dogs,t3_a7idnh,17,False,False,a7idnh,"I've had my beagle Molly for almost 15 years. She went completely blind and deaf about a year ago, and for most of that time she has been okay. However, in the last couple of months she has been barking a lot while I'm at work, no doubt because of anxiety and not knowing where I am. I thought I had the matter under control but I've received a second notice from the leasing office (I'm in an apartment complex) that says she's still barking. They will involve animal control if they have to send a third notice.

I've thought about trying to re-home her, though I'd hate to do it, but I don't know how feasible that is when she's blind and deaf and 15 years old.

I take her for walks when I can but she's not especially mobile, so she doesn't tire out. I tried anxiety medications at one point but they didn't seem to work too well. The vet prescribed a sedative, but I got the second notice anyway - apparently it hasn't been enough. I'm gone 10 hours a day and I can't change my schedule.

So I'm at a loss as to what to do. I don't think I'll be able to keep her with me, but I don't know where to turn for finding a place for her to live out what's probably her last year. I don't know how to solve the barking problem, if I can't find a home. I fear that she'll be taken by animal control, which will mean euthanasia.

I'm in the Seattle, WA area, if that's useful information.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
206,[Help] Housebreaking,dogs,t3_a7gsyw,12,False,False,a7gsyw,"Or puppy is about 3 months old. We've had him for about one month. He's half Yorkie, half Pitbull (we think).

I'm at my wits' end. We keep him in a small room which he will not go to the bathroom in at night and while we're away. I take him outside to do his business first thing in the morning, as soon as we get back from anywhere, and frequently when I'm home. He always has access to food and water.

However, he still pees and poops in the house like 10 times a day. Sometimes as soon as he comes in from outside.

I praise him verbally, physically, and with treats whenever he goes outside. Every time he has an accident, I put him outside immediately.

I believe this has, unfortunately, conditioned him to pee or poop when he wants to go outside, rather than conditioning him to go outside to poop.

As a result, I've decided to add punishment (a spank, and/or his nose in the pee) before letting him outside in order to stop him from thinking , ""I want to go outside. I should pee on the floor"". I hate punishing him like this, and he hates it too, but I don't know what else to do.

In the past, I've also tried scheduled feedings to control his bowel movements, with no luck.

I don't think his previous owners treated him very well, but I think they were at least trying to train him with puppy pads. Based on my experiences with them, I think they probably didn't really commit to it however.

Aside from this, he's an amazing pup, and pretty obedient (I can often take him out with no leash).

What can I do? Will be just grow out of it?

207,[VENT] [Discussion] I don’t deserve my dog.,dogs,t3_a78cze,32,False,False,a78cze,"Whenever I have had a really bad day and I get home, my dog comes running when he hears the lock click in place. That exact moment is my most happiest and favourite moment I experience in my life as I see a bundle of fluff running towards the glass door. 

He sometimes sings/howls and spins around some days when he sees me. He is always there to greet me and there has never been a day where he isn’t there. He is just so overcome by joy; he even pees a little. (Yuck I know but it’s the thought that counts). 

That’s not even the best part though, the best part is when I sit down on the couch to watch a movie and he runs over and climbs onto my lap to he find a spot where he can rest his head on my leg or arm. 

It makes me realise how much I make him feel safe and loved. It makes me realise that even though I’m let down daily by people I love and care for and how some don’t put the same effort in returning that, he also helps me recover from the pain I feel when I’m so lonely at times. 

So I don’t deserve my dog sometimes, He does way more then he thinks to my heart and I love him dearly for that. So very much.

So here’s a reminder, your dog won’t be around forever. But they will always be there for you whenever, so appreciate them and love them all the damn time because they definitely deserve it.

One 11 year old, one 8-year-old shi-tzu poodle mix, and an 18-month-old Jack Russell Terrier Dachsund mix. The 18 month old was adopted when a family member could no longer care for her. She wasnt house trained, but we were able to get her to go outside to do her business and such after a few weeks of training. However, she has a bad habit of eating things she shouldnt eat. Glasses, retainers, credit cards, stuffed animals; you name it, she's eaten it. In the last 3-4 months (we got the puppy last January for reference) the older dogs have begun to join her in eating our valuables. In addition, they now like to pee and poop on the floors, despite being trained and well behaved for as long as we've owned them. The oldest was treated for a UTI in september, which we believed was causing him to pee on the floor. He recently started doing it again. The shi-tzu poodle has been pooping on the floor on an almost daily basis for months, and despite attempting to re-train her, she won't stop. Is this just a symptom of the two older dogs' age? Is it because of the puppy? It has become a major problem in my house."
210,[Help] New job. Is 5 days a week of doggy daycare too much/negligent?,dogs,t3_a7endf,12,False,False,a7endf,"I adopted a 7 yo terrier cross approximately 8 months ago. We are very closely bonded and I spend as much time with him as possible. He is very loved. Returning him to the shelter is not an option, so please don't suggest this.

I currently work 2 jobs. I have been self-employed and worked unsociable hours 6 days a week (including all day Saturdays and Sundays) for the last year, but I have been able to bring my dog to work with me. I recently started working 2 and a half days a week in my dream job at a local university. One of the team members at the university is stepping down, so there is the potential for me to move to full-time there and shut down this other business - which is a whole other emotional conflict!

But obviously one of my biggest considerations is my dog. At the moment, he is in a local doggy daycare from 8:30-5:30 on the 2 days a week that I work at the university. It's actually been great for his socialisation and the workers there tell me that he potters around and plays with the other dogs. It is a very good daycare. He is always very happy to see me and wants to play when I pick him up. 

I live around 20 minutes from the university and could potentially come home to walk him during my lunch break, but this would be rushed and I am not sure whether this may in-fact be crueler, as he'll have 20 minutes tops of interaction during this fleeting visit, get worked up, only to then be left alone for another 4 hours. I would prefer to take him to doggy daycare where I know he is being stimulated and safe. But is 5 days a week too much? Is this negligent? I'm probably overthinking this, so please tell me if I am! 

Are there any working dog parents who use doggy daycare 5 days a week? Please share your preferences, methods and suggestions!"

215,German Shepherd Separation Anxiety [HELP],dogs,t3_a7jh0i,4,False,False,a7jh0i,"Hi all! I have a nearing-4 year old GSD named King. We got king when he was about 1.5-2 years old, from a family that didn't train him, and let their kids do whatever they pleased to him. Also, sorry for the lengthy post in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

**My dogs and cats**

In case I reference any of the names in this post, these are my dogs. I have 4 dogs and 2 cats. King the GSD, Dude the old pitbull mix, Charlie the Yorkie, and Peggy, the 3 legged Yorkie terrier, as well as Gemini the kitten and Momo the fat tuxedo cat (he doesn't do much). King and Charlie have a bad relationship. Charlie constantly antagonizes and tries to fight King, despite their size difference. For this reason, we have to keep them separated at all costs-or there will be blood.

&amp;#x200B;

**Separation Anxiety**

When we first got King, we started crate training him, like we have with all of our dogs. He does great in his crate, and will often go in it, even if I offer him my bed. But when he does take the chance to lay on my bed, he likes to chew my covers and pillows and such. He also destroys any all toys that he has. I've been trying to train him to not do that, and to behave a little bit more, but I'm lost as to how to stop him from chewing. I know that it's most likely due to his anxiety, because he only does it when I'm not looking at him or not in the same room as him.

&amp;#x200B;

**Small dog-Big dog feud**

King lays in his crate, and sometimes Charlie will run to the door and bark at him. Naturally, King will start barking back, either because he doesn't like him, he's defending his territory, or both. I've noticed now, that King will now bark at nothing because he is used to Charlie constantly antagonizing him, and I feel bad. It's like he has PTSD of it-if you understand what I mean by that. So, if you were in this situation, what would you do?

&amp;#x200B;

**Leaving the room**

When I leave the room, even if I only step 1 foot out of my door, King starts whining. When I leave for school, I can still hear him whining as I'm closing the door, and it makes me feel so bad for him. How can I make him feel safe and happy, knowing I will be coming back to him eventually?

&amp;#x200B;

**King in the yard**

Additionally, when King is in the yard, he is constantly barking at the ""neighbors"" (I live next to a convenience store, as well as a mechanic shop). He doesn't listen to me if I try to train him outside, and the only things I can get him to do are to come to me, and to sit. How would you go about getting him to stop barking at the ""neighbors"" as well as getting him to listen to me while outside.

&amp;#x200B;

**King's friendships**

Sometimes, if King is whining towards the end of the night, I'll let him out one more time before I go to bed. Usually whenever he does whine though, I let him outside and make sure he has food and water. This is when he runs to my kitchen or living room and finds his friend Gemini. An unlikely friendship, sure, but it is a friendship. King will climb on my couch and lay with the kitten, but often times I have to get him off because I'm not sure if he will start biting at the cushions and such-because if he did, I fear what my mom would do to me and King.

The relationships with King and my other animals are as follows: (n = don't get along, y = gets along)

King - Dude = Y

King - Charlie = NNNN

King - Peggy = Mostly Y, sometimes N if she's near my grandma(she's very protective of her)

King - Gemini = Y

King - Momo = Y/N, They don't really mind each other, but Momo has a bad temper and doesn't like to be bothered so if King comes near him, he hisses. No fights come of it though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Questions**

**How can I help King overcome his separation anxiety?** Pheromone Collars?

**How can I get King to stop chewing and destroying my bed, as well as his toys?**

**What is the best course of action regarding King and Charlie?**

**How can I get King to listen to me while he's in the yard, as well as stop barking at the neighbors?**

**What does normal Dog and Cat play look like?** I certainly don't have a problem with them being friends, but I want to know how much is too much and when I need to intervene

&amp;#x200B;

**Last but not least, thank you so much for reading my post, as well as a big thank you for any and all help you can give me!**

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing; I don't know is this is specific to my dogs behavior, but King likes to flip his food bowl over and sometimes water bowl over, and eat off the ground. Is this normal?"
216,“Chunky” Dog? [Help],dogs,t3_a7jfz5,20,False,False,a7jfz5,"Hi all! I’ll cut to the chase; my dog is fat. I’ve been actively trying to keep her weight off: switching to high protein, low fat food (Blue Diamond Healthy Weight), exercising/running her (much to my chagrin as I do not enjoy running), playing tug of war with her for extra bursts of calorie burning, counting her calories, weighing out her food and getting rid of all of those high calorie treats and switching to dehydrated or freeze dried meat treats and raw bones, strictly. That being said, it looks to me like she’s getting bigger? Mind you, she’s a one year old beagle mix (we don’t know with what, but most likely a larger breed dog), and she’s insanely strong- we can see her muscles rippling under her fat. But when I look at what a healthy dog looks like, she doesn’t have the curve at her hind legs, and she could use some definition in her waist (?) area. Most importantly, I want her to live and be healthy in her body. She’s always been this, erm, shapely, but when I take her to the vet they never say anything or suggest any alternatives. I’ve taken these precautions on my own after I witnessed her struggle to hop on my bed. I would like to take her somewhere to get weighed, but there are no large scales for 45 pound dogs in my area, other than the vet (which she hates because the one at our vet lifts her off the ground and whines; it’s an admittedly intimidating device for a dog afraid of hearing herself sneeze) How long should I expect to wait to see some results? If she lost 3-5 pounds I feel like she would be in much better shape. Any suggestions outside of what I’m doing to make sure she gets to 40-42 pounds by her birthday in August? Thanks! "
217,"[breed] First adult doggo, breed suggestions?",dogs,t3_a7hokp,4,False,False,a7hokp,"Introduction
My boyfriend and I are looking to adopt our first dog. We both grew up with a family dog but neither of us have been adult dog owners. We live in a 1 bedroom apartment and will be able to bring the dog to work with us, so really hoping for a well-behaved doggo. I'm definitely willing to spend time training the dog on my own, as well as with classes. Ideally the dog would get on well with 2-3 30 minute walks on weekdays and a couple of hours of activity each day on the weekend. I don't need a sluggish lap dog dog, but I'm also not looking for a dog that needs constant + strict training and tons of attention. Looking for that perfect mid-size, mid-energy pupper. One last thing to add - I think I'd have issues dealing with a high-anxiety dog - one that couldn't handle car rides or being left alone.

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
Grew up with a yellow lab and terrier mix, but this would the first dog that was primarily my responsibility. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?
I plan to rescue.

3) Describe your ideal dog.
A dog that's generally chill. A dog that wants to go on hikes, hang out at my friend's apartments, at the dog park, on the couch with me etc. Thinking 15-25 lbs and aged 6 mo to 3 years. Definitely not a super anxious/needy dog or yapper, as we live in an apartment building.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
I was looking into rescuing a smaller Jindo mix (Jindo + Terrier possibly) from the Dog Meat trade in S Korea but have some concerns about them after doing some research - any advice would be welcome!  I'm most concerned that they can be aggressive to strangers, other dogs, and visitors. I’ve heard the same can be true for Chow mixes. 
I also love curly-haired pups! 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
Basic commands like staying and sitting.

Care Commitments
6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
The dog will be interacted and played with every day, especially if I can bring it to work. I am open to a good 30-45 minutes of training per day.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
2-3 30 minute walks a day. Playing with toys/a ball in the house on weeknights. Dog park, hikes (1-5 hour hikes) or just long-ass walks on weekends.

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
I’m open to grooming at home and allowing a professional do it as well. It'll likely be a mixture of both.

Personal Preferences
9) What size dog are you looking for?
I'd prefer a small-medium sized dog. ~15-25 lbs.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
I'm okay with some shedding and slobbering but barking is definitely not preferred.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
I would like to do so but it isn't necessary.

Dog Personality and Behavior
12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
Both, but a dog that can snuggle a bit would be preferred.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
Either is fine, as long as it's not too ""hey!hey!hey!hey!"" nor extremely needy.

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
Relaxed and friendly - not aggressive.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
No but if it were as simple as making sure the dog was socialized in the beginning, and/or trained a bit I'd be willing. Not interested in a lifetime of aggressive behavior though. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
Aggression toward strangers, my friends and other dogs. Yapping. 

Lifestyle
17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
In the beginning - on weekdays from 10-6, but really wanting a dog that can come to work with me every day. I'd say ideally 8 hours, but that wouldn't be often. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
My boyfriend would share the dog with me, but it would ultimately be my responsibility. He would feed it, play with it, walk it, and sometimes take it to work. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?
No other pets and not planning on it.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
No but perhaps years down the road - friend's kids. 

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
I currently rent a 1 bedroom apartment and will continue to for years. (750 sq feet and up).

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
Los Angeles. No bans that I'm aware of.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
Summer: high 80s to mid 90s in the summer, mid 60s to low 70s in the winter. 

Additional Information and Questions
24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
I'm willing to put in some time and effort to train a dog, but don't think I can take on a dog that's high maintenance. For example, I love border collies but know that they're high-energy and hyper-intelligent and I don't think I'd be enough for that breed.
I'm not interested in a lap dog, but I also don't want a super high-energy dog.  I think pomeranians are adorable but they're too tiny and yappy. BASICALLY I'M ASKING FOR THE PERFECT DOG so feel free to tell me that my asks are impossible! 

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.
Anyone have thoughts about my interest in rescuing a Jindo mix while taking the above info into consideration? I was also looking at chow mixes but my coworkers said they might not be good apartment dogs."
218,"[Discussion] So many rescue dogs from the Southern US are being brought up North, why?",dogs,t3_a7edg6,21,False,False,a7edg6,"My wife and I lost our Great Dane a while back, he was 10 and lived a full life, but he was in so much pain from bone cancer we made the decision.

We promised ourselves that when our kids weren't toddlers anymore we would adopt a shelter pup instead of going purebred. When we started looking at Humane Society, Rescues, and other shelters/fosters we saw a TON of dogs from the South (Texas, Georgia, etc). The pup that we adopted was brought up with a bunch of other dogs from a kill shelter in Texas, and the conditions seem to have been lax (only half the litter got proper shots, dogs was underweight, etc.)

Broad brush: Does anyone know any more about why this is or background on it? It just seemed strange that half the dogs we saw came from the South (excepting the Humane Society which was mostly local surrendered dogs).

PS - We looked mostly at Great Danes and Staffordshire terriers (or dogs that had some of those breeds in them). The Staffordshire mixes were very common, of course with lots of other breeds likely mixed in like bull terriers, labs, American bulldog, etc. I do think the shelters are full of 'pit bull mixes' because some people fear them, and maybe its just the 'pit bulls' being brought up north.

219,[Help] My dog isn't interested in toys. Suggestions?,dogs,t3_a7gfyk,6,False,False,a7gfyk,"I just adopted a 1 yr old pitbull mix and she's an absolute sweetheart. Her favorite thing is just to be pet and sleep on the couch/bed next to you. I love her calm nature but when we're at home, she doesn't really do anything but sleep and I'm worried she's bored. I walk her about 3 times a day for 30-60 minutes and take her out to go the bathroom obviously. When she's out for walks, she's so excited but when I try to engage her in her toys at home, she really doesn't care. She has a variety of toys (squeaky, plush, chewing) but doesn't seem to care about them. This is my 4th dog and the first time I've experienced this. Has anyone had a dog that isn't interested in toys? Are there any toys that your dog actually enjoyed? I'm thinking about getting her a Kong or one of those squirrel pop-out toys as they're more mentally engaging. She loves her bones but I don't want to just have her eating bones all day."

My schedule is mostly evenings (2 to 10pm) so they would get a nice walk in the morning, at around 1 pm and again at 10:30 pm. Is this enough? Are there certain breeds I should look for and stay away from? If I had to choose I would like a pit bull or a mini pincher. I love those.

224,[Discussion] Just caught a neighbor kid in the cat flap petting my dogs while I was gone...,dogs,t3_a7035p,188,False,False,a7035p,".. I am totally baffled how these kids thinks this is okay. The dogs are friendly and while I trust them you never know. They are still dogs guarding their territory and while the humans are out they are in charge. She's lucky they are nice and I am lucky they are nice. I can only imagine the consequences if she ended up hurt. This girl and one of her friends will come knocking ever day at at 1.30pm sharp asking to play and pet them, and they won't take no for an answer and will keep asking all kinds of questions to drag out the time. I don't think they're older than 6-7, so I've asked my dad to contact their parents because we can't lock the cat flap either as it's very cold and our cat would get in a bad mood.

I remember being this kid when I was younger, but I was never this intense or disrespectful, and I obviously don't want to turn into 'that' neighbor on the street either. I have little to no experience with kids, so I am unsure how to best tell them off next time without talking to them as if they are adults.

Any ideas or thoughts on how to proceed? Other than having messaged their parents, I'd like to know what I can do or say if it happens again.

Edit: Puppy tax! https://i.imgur.com/IAAkffI.jpg

226,[Help] Why does my dog whine so much after a walk?,dogs,t3_a7f6pg,7,False,False,a7f6pg,"I rescued a dog from the humane society about a month ago. They thought he might be two but it's clear now he is most likely around one year old. He's possibly a lab/shepherd mix (getting DNA results back soon). 

Generally he is well behaved. We exercise a ton (I think)-- I work from home. I get up before work to walk for about 45 minutes, then walk him another ~45 minutes at lunch, sometimes including off leash play.  After work at some point my boyfriend and I will usually take him out again for 45-90 minutes (depending on schedules and his energy, and if any of our friends are at the dog park).  He gets two more potty breaks in the evening.

He eats only out of puzzle toys, and we do a bit of training every day. He has several different types of toys for tugging, ripping, chewing, and squeaking, and he sleeps through the night from midnight until 8 am. We live on the 28th floor in a condo, so going up and down involves a pretty regular routine of riding the elevator. 

In the last week or so, when we come back up, he starts whining a ton when we get inside. Usually the whining lasts about 10 minutes, where he wanders around the condo, looks at me, sometimes lays next to me to whine. Then he gets busy eating, chewing a toy, or he just passes out asleep. What could be the cause of his whining? 

He had one accident inside about two weeks ago when our schedule got messed up and we went too long without taking him outside. I noticed right before he peed inside that he whined a bit. He normally never asks to go outside at all. He lays around until we put jackets on then he knows we're going out. 

Since then I have been strict about going out every 3-5 hours. Any thoughts on the whining? Have you had this experience before?"
227,[help] 4 month Border Collie - FRAP after pool dive,dogs,t3_a7icln,2,False,False,a7icln,"Hi all.   


I have a deaf and blind from one eye, 4 months old BC.  


I have been with him for a week or so and been trough basic training commands, like sitting, come, stay, no. These commands have been really easy to teach him and our communication seems to work really well.  


We've been exercising him with a lot of long walks every day, puzzle exercise and play the full day as I have been off work.  


We live in a hot area and we have a pool. In the first days he was sitting near the pool and putting his paws into it. In a moderate way we've been teaching him how to go to the shallow part of the pool and more recently he felt confident to swim with us inside the pool and most important to exit the pool by himself as we were affraid that he would be too confident and jump unnatented.  


Today, he has been jumping and getting out of the pool by himself.   


*And here is where the problem lies:*  


As soon as he gets out of the pool he acts extremely energized (Zoomies / FRAP). This would be OK but at the same time he does his runs he also tries to confront everybody by **jumping hard into to people**, **nibbing people hands/clothes in an agressive way**, **barking and growling non-stop**. He tries to grab anything he finds in his way and agressively tries to play with it. More to that, the floor in the surroundings is slippery and I am a little affraid he could hurt himself.  


My first reaction was to keep my stance, not run behind him, and as soon as I find him in a calm state I hush him down with some petting and rewarding.  


If he does not calm down after 3 minutes or so, I place him in his sleeping place. He will cry for a couple of minutes and some minutes after he calms down I bring him back and he mantains calm and normal.  


My problem here is that after a couple of minutes he will jump back to the pool and this process starts all over again (even at night).  


I would love to know if anybody has a similiar situation, know more about what I could to to try to understand his reaction and the best ways to deal with this situation.  


Thanks!

228,[discussion] Dog collar accident... Feeling shook up.,dogs,t3_a7ciew,17,False,False,a7ciew,"My 2yo dog Lucy and 6mo pup Nelson love to play bitey face and wrestle in the living room while I chill on couch and watch. Today was just like any other day. 

Suddenly I hear Nelson whimpering loudly and I see Lucy's mouth around his neck. Initially I'm shocked that Lucy would be so aggressive! I get down and begin trying to open Lucy's jaw to release Nelson. That's when I see his green collar wrapped around Lucy's bottom two canine teeth. My stomach drops as I realize the terror of the situation

The longest 30 or 40 seconds of my life go by as I'm trying to get to that snap release on Nelson's collar. Neither of them would hold still. Finally I hear it. I'm so thankful I was able to release them. It could have been so much worse. 

After the collar is off, Nelson runs away to the kitchen. I look over at Lucy, who is trembling. Nelson's nose is bleeding. My stomach is in knots.

After a bit of time, I encourage Nelson to come back to Lucy and I. One of my biggest worries for some reason is that their relationship doesn't hurt from this. Nelson is a bit freaked out but once he realizes Lucy just wants to lick him all over and I wanna calm him and love him with many pets, he licks us both back. His nose bleed goes away after maybe 15 minutes. He seems to be just fine.

I'm so glad everyone is okay. I did a little research to find things called break-away collars, designed to prevent these freak accidents. I now know I need something like this, but I can't quite understand how they work to prevent this kind of thing, yet still function on walks.. Anyone have insight or product recommendation? Anyone else experience something like this? I'm trying to get over this but I just feel so sick thinkinh about how this could have happened while I was not home. "

He is perfectly comfortable with us touching his feet, checking his nails, etc, but as a new dog owner I was uncomfortable with trimming his nails myself. My vet offers nail trimming services for a reasonable price so I set up an appointment.

When we got there, the assistant met me in the lobby, knelt down to meet Gambit for a few seconds, asked me if it was ok to give him treats (it is), and then took his leash and left to the back room without me. When she came back she told me he tried to bite her and they were forced to muzzle him, which she said had a calming effect on him. She then lectured me on ""working with his feet"" so that he'd be comfortable having them touched.

He has no problem having his feet touched or manipulated. He is fussy when being brushed, but that's it. I wasn't in the room so I didn't see what happened, but regardless, how do I work with him so this doesn't happen again?"
231,[Discussion] Preventing reactive behaviors while a puppy,dogs,t3_a7g2zg,10,False,False,a7g2zg,"I've been reading a lot about how to train and help reactive dogs. But is there a way to keep a dog from being reactive in the first place?

The only indication to prevent this I've seen is ""socialization"" and ""exposure"" to things as a puppy. But beyond that I can't seem to figure out what else can be done.

It seems that the magic happens from early exposure and socialization, where dogs cannot always assume they get what they want. There's behaving with others through interaction, and then there's the fact that not every single person or animal can be interacted with. If this is done correctly, will that help prevent reactive behaviors later?

I find it easy to socialize through interaction, but other than avoiding interactions, how else can this be done for exposure to things and having the pup understand how to manage the feeling of not getting everything they want?"
232,"[Help] how do you know if a puppy is ""the one""?",dogs,t3_a7i0od,4,False,False,a7i0od,"First, background info : my ten year old husky mix died unexpectedly last year from a mystery medical emergency. Three months ago I signed up to foster, and fell immediately in love with our second dog but couldn't keep her because she wanted to eat my cat. 

For two months I've been obsessively looking at dogs to adopt. The foster group had a couple of 3 month old pom/shih tzu mix pups come up, so I put my name down. All of the videos his foster posted showed him and his brother being active outdoors so I thought he would be perfect - a big dog attitude in an apartment friendly body.

He's been wth me for four days and is already better behaved than most adult dogs I've met. But he doesn't feel like *my* dog. And I don't mean that I'm comparing him to my husky; I just don't feel a bond. He also seems to have lost some of his gregarious nature since he was separated from his brother and really seems to enjoy being carried around.

I have to decide in two days whether he's a good fit. I had hoped to have an active companion, and though he probably just needs time, I'm also thinking that he would be happier as a lap dog. He has so many great qualities, and eventually I would feel bonded to him, but right now it doesn't feel right for no good reason.

Our puppy is dog reactive... but not in the usual way!,dogs,t3_a7fntr,9,False,False,a7fntr,"So our 6 month old puppy is dog reactive.... except in an over the top “I need to be your friend please let me play with you” way...And it is EMBARRASSING. If he sees another dog on a walk... elevator... street corner... whatever 9/10  times he starts losing it. Whining, pulling, hopping, barking, etc. Simply because he wants to play. On top of that when he does get the go ahead to meet them he goes right for the face, trying to lick them and 80% of other dogs do not like it. And get snappy with him. 

I have no idea what we did wrong, he’s not poorly socialized we took him every where, we did puppy training classes, a few day care days, friends dogs, many many different people and situations. He’s completely friendly and a total sweet heart but trying to walk down the road while he’s losing his damn mind to make a new friend makes me feel like an absolute failure. 

Some other owners are fine and just laugh it off and say “better then the other way around!” And others glare at us like we are the worlds worst dog parents.  

Any advice? And to clarify we never let him run up to other dogs full blast and I step on his leash to keep him seated when meeting humans as he just really likes to lick faces of all species it seems.  

I just don’t want him to piss off the wrong dog one day, Im particularly worried about the face licking as he had an incident meeting my SO’s sisters St. Bernard, got too excited and was trying to lick his face and the St. Bernard got super aggressive... we will be in the same house again at Christmas and I’m nervous.

234,[Help] unsure if we should put our little guy down,dogs,t3_a7a87y,13,False,False,a7a87y,"We got a puppy around 1.5 years ago. He was an amazing dog who quickly learned tricks and was so playful but loving and sweet at the same time.

This summer he began getting bad health wise. He started “fly biting” (basically focal seizure) and was having a lot of trouble with his balance. We thought it may have been because of a fall and the vet said he might just be a little imbalanced from now on but seemed healthy overall.

Things have gotten much worse since then. We balked at the vets opinion and took him to a new vet and a neurologist a few months ago and an MRI showed brain lesions of unknown cause. The neurologist was unsure what it could be other than maybe a mitochondrial disease.

At this point in his life, he now seems to be unable to see. The seizure are managed. Anytime he tries to move he circles around or stumbles and falls. He doesn’t even try to walk around inside but still manages to go to the bathroom outside after much stumbling. He sleeps most of the day and doesn’t show interest in toys although he will bite on one if we hold it in his mouth for him.

Also, he can no longer eat or drink without extensive assistance. We bottle feed him water, although he’s showing less interest in that recently so I’ve been mixing some in his food. With help he can partially eat from a bowl but lately we’ve taken to hand feeding him part of his meal.

And now he has started heavily panting at random. Sometimes I wonder if it’s his way of telling us he needs something because it will often stop if I take him out or if this is related to the health issues or if he’s dehydrated (we’ve been monitoring his water intake).

His quality of life has decreased so much in the past few months and the neurologist said he may have months left.

But despite his issues the neurologist says he’s not in pain. He still gets very happy to eat food or treats and goes nuts when we get home, even if he can’t move around much successfully.  He is still very sweet and loves to cuddle. We are totally happy to be there for him and help him. 

We have another vet appointment coming up to talk about the panting and see where we stand.

I’m wondering if we’re being selfish and his complete lack of a normal dog life where he’s doing so little means he should be put down. It really does seem like he is wasting away, but we don’t wanna lose him if we don’t have to."

244,Our dog is scared of everything on walks but seemingly only in the morning [help],dogs,t3_a7cjyd,6,False,False,a7cjyd,"My wife and I got our very first dog just over a week ago. She's a 7 month old German Shepherd/Anatolian Shepherd mix. She is generally very well behaved and responds to the commands, Sit, Stay, Come and Leave it when we're in our apartment, slightly less responsive when there are distractions but we're working on that. She's quite timid  and very mellow in general for a pup her age.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue we're having is that when we take her on a walk in the morning, before it's fully light out but not still completely dark she appears to be scared of everything(i don't know why it's only in the morning and not in the evening). Granted, she's probably still not fully used to all the new sounds and smells of cars and stuff but she's even scared of garbage cans, to the point that sometimes she'll try to run into the street to avoid walking past them. Occasionally she'll be so overwhelmed that she'll just lie down and not want to go any further. Usually i'll get her to continue onto a field or something where there's less to overwhelm her but i just don't feel that she fully enjoys herself and I want these walks to be something she enjoys.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trying to hold her very close to me when we walk past something that scares her and if she does well i'll click the clicker and give her a treat but i'm just wondering if you guys have any advice for helping a timid pup overcome her fears. Any advice is welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is she barks a lot at random people. There's not really a pattern to it, sometimes she'll bark a bunch at a random person nearby and sometimes people can walk right on by and she'll not care at all. I understand this is a normal behaviour for the breed so i'm not massively concerned about it but it would be good if we could get her to bark slightly less first thing in the morning. I tend to just ignore her when she barks and i say ""quiet"" and when she stops i click and give her a treat.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise this is very early days as we've only had her for just over a week and i'm probably acting like a stupid overbearing parent haha but just thought i'd put it out there for your guys thoughts.

Groot is the name of the sheppard mix at 1 year, Soda is the bordercollie at 7 months. 
They get along wonderfully, and love to play. No issues there, thankfully.

As we have watched Soda and worked on training him, its become painfully obvious he is incredibly dense, to put it nicely. At first we chaulked it up to new house, new people, new friend. Then as the weeks went by nothing changed. He often does things that make no real sense. Here, lets cover some examples.

He struggles with any command that isnt sit. Not that he doesnt want to do it, he just cant figure out down or shake or, well, anything thats not sit. But god damn will he sit. No matter what is going on. Groot keeps trying to show him as well. No dice.

He hits his head on tables. Like a lot. And not just once, if hes under a table and you say anything involving him he will hit his head as many times as he will look up. He has hit his head trying to see what he hit his head on. He made it to the 4th thump before we pulled him out from under the table.

He doesnt understand object perminance. Once the ball/treat/food is out of his sight it no longer exists. This is in stark contrast to Groot who remembers everything you do in front of him once and will make sure he doesn't miss out on anything if he knows he can be involved in some ways.

He has extreme issues with jumping on my wife and I. He also uses his paws in bad ways when jumping. We have tried so many things but he just really wants your face. Possitive reinforcement on this one just gets him rilled up and makes it worse, so we tried a spray bottle to help keep him down. I don't think he registers what it does until it happens, even if hes just been sprayed. Hes learning sit means he will get pets and love but he can barely contain himself when he knows thats the reason why.

He doesnt see movement well at all. We can throw anything for him to catch and hell just stare at you until it smacks him right in the face. Its hilarious but makes fetch awkward. Groot has attempted to help us with this but Soda just stares at him like he pulled off some magic trick to get the ball that vanished.

He constantly steals bones from my other dog. It doesnt even seem malicious, and Groot thinks its the best game. They will both have bones, will be laying there when all of a sudden its as of Soda forgets he had a bone, and will walk over and take Groot's bone. Groot just gets up and takes Soda's bone when this happens. Repeat forever. At first Groot was sort of confused but now he just goes with it. We have been working on this, but short of tying a bone to him we haven't made much progess with this one. Its not that he wants both bones, he is happy with the one he has as long as you give it to him again. 

Ive looked up so much in terms of what to do to help this breed combo to learn how they should behave and be trained. Each and every article is like ""He should be so easy to train!"". However its not the case. Groot is super smart and can learn a new trick incredibly fast, whereas i can't get Soda to shake to save his life. Any advice? I love this dog and hes great, but his mental issues are starting to make me wonder if we need to see a behaviorist about him and see if somethings lacking upstairs."

253,[Help] Dog showing signs of separation anxiety.,dogs,t3_a7cp2s,3,False,False,a7cp2s,"We have a 10 month old Goldendoodle named [Bristol](https://imgur.com/gallery/npTScag).  Overall she is a wonderful sweet puppy, however lately she has been being a little destructive.

She had been crated and had been doing fairly well.  She would whine a bit but eventually calmed herself down.  After she was spayed, we tried to crate her with the cone on (bad idea in hindsight), and due to this she got a little traumatized and even escaped the metal crate.  After seeing this happen the first day, we bought a smaller inflatable cone and the next day that was destroyed and she once again had escaped.  At that point we figured, if she can get out what’s the point of crating her.

Well she did great for about 2.5 months, however, over the last few weeks I have come home at lunch, as I always do, and she has gotten into something or damaged something.  First it was the Christmas Tree decorations (after 2 weeks of not touching them at all), then it was our entertainment stand, then a Blu Ray that had a slip cover, and who knows what I will find today.

I do believe she has separation anxiety as she doesn’t do these things when we are home and is often just wanting to play fetch.  I want her safe and comfortable being alone.  I have looked into boarding and training which is around $1400 for a month of training, but don’t know that I can afford that.

Also, to complicate things for her further and also could be part of her destructive habits, we are due to have a baby any day now.  So I worry any training we do will not really help as my wife will be home over the next 8-12 weeks anyway.

Any thoughts?"

We took her to a local vet to have her scanned for a micro chip but there was none. She had matted fur behind both ears and around her back paws. There’s some kind of rash or infection under her back leg and she walks without straightening her back legs at all. It’s almost like a squat that she moves around in and the vet we took her to said it looked like an older back injury that did not heal properly and gave us the number and address for a shelter that is know for helping dogs with health issues and not euthanizing them. 

Well, after one night with her being sweet and cute and quiet and happy everyone wants to keep her. So I just wanted to know what anyone thinks about a dog with that kind of injury that affects the way she walks. She even favors one front leg over the other but still uses both to move around. One back leg is almost completely unused, which is the one with the irritation, and the other one she uses to scratch or push around with on the carpet. Is this something she’ll live with forever or will it affect her life span? I don’t know how old she is but she seems young spirited.

I was wondering if any of you have a similar issue. My 5 year old whippet, Mercury, has always had this annoying habit of wanting to go out for a toilet break in the middle of the night. This dog is a champion at holding it in, has been known to not need to go out for up to 12 hours (because the weather is _slightly_ cold and damp, very typical whippet) and he goes out for a final wee just before I turn in for the night. He gets several walks of various lengths throughout the day.

He’s been doing this whole wanting-out-during-the-witching-hour-thing for years, and I’ve finally gotten tired enough of this that I want him to just sleep through the night. He’s in good health, if a little overweight. 

If Jack whippet can sleep through the night, then Mercury can too. But I dont know how or where to start. Can you guys give me any ideas?"

I have a great Pyrenees/Golden mix that I rescued a few years ago. He is such a sweet dog with people and babies, however since an incident at a dog park. 

Some background: I had previously taken my dog to the dark park countless times since I adopted him and never had an issue. One day I was throwing the ball to him and a standard poodle came up from the side and bit him on the mouth trying to get the ball from him. They tussled, but was able to get them broken up. Poodle owner was apologetic and we went on our way.

A few weeks later I brought him to a friends house who also has a golden. They are familiar with each other and play all the time. About an hour into running around my dog laid down and the golden came over to play some more. My dog got up and viciously chased him down and slammed the golden down by the neck. My dog was growling and seemed aggressive. No blood was drawn and we went on our way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This situation has since happened twice more with other dogs. Is there anything I can do to help get his mind right again? Ever since the initial dog park incident he has never been the same. The strange thing is before these things happen he shows no signs of aggression. He does not get rigid, he does not expose teeth, he doesn't pin his ears back. He just explodes.... any help would be great!! "

I leash her next to my bed at night to force her to ask me at night as well. She's timid and doesn't like to ""bother"" me.

I tried leashing her today when I went to work, and she destroyed a bunch of things in reach. She didn't go though! Hah!

I know crating is the normal solution and I am not opposed to it. I'm a fan! But even though I bought her a $200 ""lion cage,"" she has hurt herself in the crate and already almost destroyed one of the latches. 

Most of the house is hardwood or tile, and that's all she has access to during the day, so cleaning up isn't hard and the smell is gone. But man, it definitely puts me in a bad mood to hunt for all the poo when I get home. 

She has a dog walker, so she's never alone more than 5 hours at a time. Feeding is twice a day and she has an opportunity to go out about an hour after eating.

Yes, I'm starting the process to improve her relationship with the crate, but she hates it so much that it'll take months, maybe years to address! If ever!

there's a house a street over from me that I can see perfectly. for over an hour now, the dogs have been chained outside in the driveway. I don't see a car so I'm not sure if anyone is home. it's currently 22ºf (-6ºc) outside with winds of 19mph, so it feels like 8ºf (-13ºc).

one of the dogs is a husky that seems to be having fun, but the other dog looks like a pit or a boxer type dog who doesn't seem to be having as much fun. this dog keeps walking back towards the porch of the house.

thanks guys

She is usually fine if me or my partner is around and even though she runs at loud truck noises to her little den under the coffee table (we live very close to a road), she is usually fine once it passes. She doesnt go outside a ton but it seems to be by choice as we usually have to coax her into taking walks.  She seems to prefer inside couch life and naps in front of the space heater. She is also usually great with people and we are the only 2 people she sees 99% of the time.  
Yesterday though I did chores i.e. dishes, cleaned up the house, did some minor rearranging of furniture and hung some new blinds.  This made a good bit of noise ill admit but nothing she hasnt heard before. 
Except this time after I finished everything she started acting very spooked.  Hiding under anything available and staying by my side from room to room in a low kind of slink while constantly sniffing and looking around.  She has remained like this for going on 36 hours now, has eaten very little and neither of us has seen her use the bathroom. She wont go near the kitchen anymore and stares at one corner while shes in it (please no ghost jokes). Weve checked the corner thoroughly and its just a plain wall where a table is.  As a result weve brought her food in the living room but still she almost ignores it.
 Anyone have any ideas what could be suddenly setting her off? This is the only house shes been in since her foster care (besides the side of the road where they found her) and we havent had any problems like this so far.  Shes been a model pup. Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post."

She's a 1 1/2 year old english springer spaniel - we adopted her back in June and got her spayed in September (she had had a litter of puppies in April before we adopted her). She wasn't crate trained (still working on it) and the previous owner said she was housebroken but we're struggling with that right now.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in a 500 sq ft apartment, so when my husband and I leave for work in the morning, we leave her loose in the kitchen/living room area. My husband usually takes her out first thing in the morning around 630, and then I'll take her out again around 745 before going to work. She'll pee both times, and poop once (630 round generally), and she holds it until my husband gets back around 2-3 pm, completely out of her crate. However, in the past month or so, she's started having accidents when we're both in the house and it's generally when we're in the bathroom/bedroom area. She doesn't have a 'tell' - she'll be lying on the couch while my husband is working on his computer, and then when he goes to the bathroom, she'll run into the bedroom or hallway and pee. She'll also poo in the hallway or kitchen if one of us is in the bathroom (happened 2x this week, never happened before).

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned it to her previous owner when the accidents first started, who said she had multiple UTIs and the vet recommended doing a sonogram, but she never ended up doing it. We took our pupper to the vet to make sure it wasn't a UTI and the vet said she was fine, so it's not that. We're not sure what's going on here since she can clearly hold it while we're gone. We tried getting a bell for the front door but she is a bit afraid of sounds so I don't think she likes ringing the bell very much. We're not sure if she's having very selective separation anxiety? She will literally only have accidents if we're in the bathroom/bedroom, even if she's there with us. We're a bit perplexed and any help would be really appreciated!"

I had no clue that her fur could be so soft - she said it was the top or guard hairs that made it rougher. It’s silky soft now. 

I wasn’t planning on keeping it up (since it wasn’t matted before) but it does seem more sanitary, so I went ahead and scheduled an appt for 7 weeks. She is my smelly one and I’m guessing this would help. 

The groomer even gave me an electric toothbrush for free and said to practice putting it around her face and feet 30 sec/day and that way she’ll get more used to it and will be able to get more detail around the face next time.

280,[Help] Senior dog extremely grumpy in the evening,dogs,t3_a770cv,5,False,False,a770cv,"My Shih tzu poodle cross just turned 13 and the past few weeks she’s become miserable in the evenings. If she’s on the couch the slightest move by us or our other dog causes her to snap and become vicious (even if she’s not touched). She’ll often lunge at the younger dog even if it wasn’t what disturbed her. I’m scared she’s going to actually bite our other dog or us. She’s got some poodle attitude but this is taking it to the extreme. 

During the day she’s perfectly fine and does not react the same way. She’s very loving and cuddly. She plays multiple times a day with her sister. And is overall pleasant. But as soon as she has her dinner it’s like a switch goes off. 

She does have numerous medical conditions but I don’t think she’s in pain. She’s been in pain before and was a bit grumpy but that was all day and once we increased her gabapentin, she was fine. I’ve also given her a massage once over and she doesn’t wince or growl. The only recent change is her losing some hearing. 

I’m at a loss as to how to curb her aggressive behaviour and would welcome any suggestions. I’m concerned she’s going to injure the younger pup or bite us. "

283,Flying with dog [discussion],dogs,t3_a7en0s,5,False,False,a7en0s,"I have a 12 pound terrier mix, Charlie. We recently flew with him from the Bay Area to Chicago and it was great, but expensive. An extra $110 each way.

Here’s the thing. My fiancé suffers from panic attacks and all of the craziness surrounding travel, from packing to being getting to the airport too late (or too early) to the perceived risk of flying, really sets off her anxiety.

With the dog, however, things were MUCH better. It gave her something else to focus on and his calm presence helped her not to panic. Usually she’d take a tranquilizer on a flight but she didn’t need it this time.

He’s legitimately performing the function of an emotional support animal. So we’d like to get him certified as one, but we don’t have the time (or money) before our next flight to have her start seeing a therapist (although she probably should).

I took a look at the forms that you need to certify your dog as an ESA for a few different airlines and they seem... easy to forge.

286,[Discussion] How to grieve,dogs,t3_a72r6l,5,False,False,a72r6l,"i wasn't sure how to start talking about this. my wife's rottweiler is dying, and i had been crying. this sounds funny enough.

my wife's rott is 11 years old. To my wife and her family, the responsibility of raising a dog is just feed. they dont exactly spend a lot of time with her. yes they like the dog, she is very lovable, but my wife and her family isnt really an ideal master for a dog. most of her life she was being chained, long enough for a little run, not enough for me. but, its their dog, their house. i unchained her whenever i get the chance, but rarely. i do get the chance to bring her out, rarely. she love it a lot. 

she does not get bath alot, probably monthly. its a chore to them. they dont really touch her a lot, big dog with big smell, but she love to be touched by her master, love to spend time watch them.

i am the only one who does not care about the smell and hold her puppy her and make her happy, rarely, as its their dog, their house.

but in sickness, i was always there. the vet knows me more than any of the family. she had pyometra before, and it was a emergency. i was due flying the next day and she had not been ate well in a week, and bleeding pus. the family didnt think it worth a trip to the vet and thought it should be waited out. 

she could had died 5 years ago if i wasnt insist to bring her to the vet that day, it was a emergency with immediate surgery. 

i rarely get her time in health, but i was never left out in sick. i was to blamed as i didnt spend more time for her, i should. i felt bless again and again i get the chance to bring her to health. not this time.

a year ago i got married with my wife, and she moved in with me. this means i got lesser chance/need to travel to her home as she was staying with her family before. which means i get to see the dog less.

2 months ago she was diagnosed with arthritis, again when i brought her to the vet. she was still in the mood and still walking, only limping a bit. medicine was given and i thought with care she will be better, or as better as it can be. 

last week, she stopped eating, and no longer can stand. two days later, she stop moving and only lie on one side. i get the news yesterday.

when i went to see her, she was laying beside her urine and waste. she dont eat and her water is beyond her reach, she was crying. i was about to cry,

i get her out and bath her, slowly. feed her water, and gently clean her dried tears. she cannot even bark.

i turned her around to see bedsore on two places, i can see the bone on one of it...

She is receiving IV under the skin right now, and have to stay at the vet because she had dehydrate too much and the vet couldnt find her vein on her limp. she is already shock when i brought her to the vet. 

the vet said there will not be any quality of life left for her. and i am thinking a painless way for her to go. then my wife and her brother said maybe not, should let her go on nature cause.

i finally snapped...

i hate her family...and at that moment i hated her as well. they are a family of 6 and they cannot take good care on a dog. i cannot understand how the hell can the family let the dog in this state for days. how the hell they can think it is ok when she is not moving, and let she stay motionless. how the hell can they think it is ok for her just lay with her urine and waste. how the hell they do not care when she is sicked and powerless. how can they have her best and ignore her when she it at her worse. how can they always think about what THEY one, but not once, not even once they think about what she wants. not once, they do not think only for themselves.

i can see how much blame the rott has in her eyes because she can no longer stand and try to lick me, she can no longer sit when i asked her to sit. she is crying. i feel so powerless.

i had been facing death of my love one. blessed, they died with old age. at the very end of their life, my family had provided all the care they needed. we dont feel guilty about not doing enough to ease the passing, or lack of hospice treatment. i lost both my grandparent in last two years. they both were bedridden weeks and months. none of them had bedsore. i was devastated, and in fact i was still grieving over my grandmother who passed at the beginning of this year. but i know me and my family did everything i could.

and for the rott who is receiving IV, and going to spend the rest of the night alone at the vet, i feel so much guilt and i cannot blame myself enough...my wife and her family feel sad, and i feel devastated. 

i am already devastated for entire year, trying hard not to show. its getting harder.

sorry for the lack of construction and the confusing personal address. for me she is not just a dog or an animal, she is as much a family to me as my own family goes. i have difficulties addressing the dog as it. and forgive my writing, i needed a place to rant and i am not able to think clearly enough.

290,[Discussion] New Pup,dogs,t3_a794gh,2,False,False,a794gh,"So it's been a long time since I've been down this path so I'm looking for helpful hints and advice. I recently had to put down my almost 13yo partner in crime Koa after a long battle with Lar-Par. Short of cancer, I have never hated a disease more. I hope none of you ever have to go through that. He was a Chessie/BC mix that was too smart for his own good. It was like having a 2yo in the house. That would have been last Friday. Yes..I am already on the hunt for a new pup 4 days later and have located one that Im hooked on. I have grieved, but I've had a long time to grieve as well. I have some unresolved issues with how sudden it happened, even knowing it was coming, but that is on me alone and not the new dog. I'll miss him hardcore and have him to thank for many things in my life, but the best thing is to bring another into our home.

Now to the happier subject at hand. The pup. He is a 9 week yo BC/Aussie mix. He's coming from a local farm and both Mom and Dad are registered. I swore I would never go this route but after talking with the local pounds this weekend in Seattle I am completely turned off by them and the bureaucracy required to adopt. Koa was a quick visit and $85 adoption fee. Now it's pages, interviews, and hundreds of dollars. Anyways..

Again..the pup. 9wk BC/Aussie Mix. Im hoping to take possession in about a week. I need to finish his puppy shots, and then eventually get him fixed. I have no idea what that runs anymore, but Im sure its a couple hundred bucks. Puppy and obedience school. Smart dog and is going to need work on discipline &amp; commands so the dog doesnt end up ruling the house. This one I plan on enforcing crate training and Im looking at getting a solid crate for during rides. Koa was crate trained, then I got married, his crate got moved, and he took to sleeping in the bedroom. He won regardless. The new pup will be able to come to work with me. Obviously have to wait a few weeks, but once cleared I plan on 2-3 days a week in the office. The other 2 I'm thinking doggy daycare to stay socialized. I also want to get him acclimated to boarding as we do travel occasionally for work and have a longer trip this summer. Im looking at Pup Insurance and possibly a tracking collar as well.

What other obvious stuff am I missing? Its such a weird reset after dealing with a geriatric dog for the past year. I look forward to the challenges, but want to have the bases covered as much as possible.

Thanks in advance for any helpful advice."
291,[Help] at what point do I make the call that my dog is dangerous and what do I do about it,dogs,t3_a77h81,5,False,False,a77h81,"My dog is 7 now. She is a 90ish pound dog that would be traditional described as a pit bull, or bully breed. Ive had her since she was 3months. She was well socialized as a pup. I would take her with me everywhere literally, to parties especially if there were other dogs, hikes, walks, dog parks etc very active and out doing things.

She first ever starting being defensive towards other dogs at the dog park. As she got older i slowly noticed her having less interest in the other dogs and more interest in walking the park with me or playing fetch. She eventually became slightly possessive of balls but only to the point that she would snip at other dogs if they became very persistent or engaged with her. Slowly stopped taking her to the dog park as much because she didnt seem into as much as regular hikes or walks. 

Over time her demeanor was known to me as friendly but will nip or defend against dogs that will jump on her or be overly hyper/playful with her.

I was living at home with another dog, a blue healer, who has always been very resource protective and they have always been really close (both spade females) and rarely fight or have any tension between them.

We moved to a large new family home and recently my brother got a puppy (full male) as a new addition to the home. For the most part they get a long well and play pretty much daily however my dog has/occasionally will nip/...I dont want to say attack but I dont know what to call the behavior exactly. But she will somewhat go after him when he wont leave her alone. She has never broke his skin and from what i can tell didnt actually bite exactly when she does this. She has also done this to my brothers other dog, a daschund when we were all in the kitchen cooking one time, again never broke the skin or cause any actual damage. And one other time when a stranger came in to this new house with their dog for a visit, and the guy freaked and overly reacted when he saw my dog cause her to become agitated. 

She gets pretty reactive in the sense that if she gets in a tense spot and I or someone  else reacts poorly she will become agitated, and then finally she got into a scuffle with her good friend dog and for the first time from what I've seen actually broke skin and I actually ended getting a good bite breaking up the fight. 

It's getting to the point that I'm not sure when I decide that the line has been crossed and her behavior is dangerous. Obvisouly some of the things are explainable in a sense. The strange man with a strange dog entering the house, the puppy being high energy and having poor dog skill yet, but I dont want to wait until its beyond that, and were all a little on our toes with her around the other dogs right now.

Additionally this behavior wouldn't seem so bad if it weren't for her size. The blue healer has had somewhat of the same behavior but shes small and not as 'scary' when shes done these things

Edit: I would just like to mention that she is a very welled trained dog overall, and I've actually worked with dogs for a good chunk of my adult life, and have had atleast one dog in my immediate surroundings for my entire life"

Dachshund, 11 YRS in March, Female never spayed, around 10-13lbs (educated guess)

Came home from school today &amp; my mom tells me to come look at her.

Area around her eyes seems swollen. She has sagging under her eyes. The sagging is not normal for her and it appears to be worse one one eye than the other. Her third eyelid is showing and is pinkish/red in color. Her eyes were/have been leaking. Her eyes seem to have a particular shine to it that does not reflect normal eye wetness. She is sleeping now but has her eyes more than half open, I am not sure if its because she cant fully close her eyes or if she just wants to have them open. She doesn't appears to be in discomfort/pain but does seem mopey and sad compared to her normal behavior.

Please if anyone can provide some insight of what might be going on! I love this dog more than most humans. I grew up with her and really became like my best friend. I would really appreciate your help.

It is night time and I currently don't have a car to take her to the vet. My family is also reluctant due to our financial situation at the moment. (IF I HAVE TO I WILL ASAP i.e. if she appears to be in pain or gets worse)

Like I mentioned in the title this happened out of no where TODAY. She is an older dog and had been showing signs of old age but nothing that would concern us/out of the ordinary."
295,"[Discussion] Puppy Vaccines and Early care options: Pet store clinics, Banfield wellness, or a vet?",dogs,t3_a771qb,11,False,False,a771qb,"I'm doing research for a future up for their early health. This isn't about pet insurance for accidents.

Generally, I'm seeing three options so far:

1. Veterinarian -- vaccines, checkups, spay
2. Pet store clinics -- vaccines
3. Banfield Puppy wellness

The Banfield Puppy Wellness plan seems like the best deal. I think the annual cost will be something around $600, but includes everything (vaccines, deworming, unlimited visits, and spay/neuter). It's a yearlong contract, so I'll have to stick to it. The Banfield near me has decent reviews, except complaints about the excessive upselling of things.

Pet store clinics seem to require more of a DIY approach. The one I'm looking at:

[https://www.petfoodexpress.com/resources/vaccinations/](https://www.petfoodexpress.com/resources/vaccinations/)

~~About $79 for all the vaccines and tests.~~ $300 for all the puppy packs. Then all those add-ons (not exactly sure if I need them, but just adding them) are about $70, so a total of $150. No spaying. The tricky thing is, I'll just have to time them all myself, and am limited to going every Saturday between the 1 hour window. Then I'd have to find a vet for the spaying. The downside is there's nothing other than vaccines. If spaying is about $100, then it's much cheaper than Banfield, but will I be missing out on too much other services?

EDIT: I think I would ultimately need all 3 puppy packs, so closer to a total of $300.

&amp;#x200B;

Veterinarians are a whole other thing. Every single place near me has terrible reviews, and not just because of the vet, but the front desk people. I guess that's a really big problem generally. But it's pretty terrible, and none of the vets look appealing to me. On top of that, all of them seem to be upselling their services. The two biggest complains: 1. front desk, 2. teeth cleaning costing $2k. From that, it's hard to figure out how much everything would cost for the pup at the end of the day.

I need suggestions! For a pup with parents that are carefully health tested (and quite a good track record from the breeder), which would be a good option?

I think the safest would be to just suck up the front-desk issues and try to goto the closest vet?"

I tried to get him to eat &amp;amp; drink, which he refuses. I called our vet today, who told me to monitor him for another day. The vomiting has stopped, but he is lethargic, doesn’t want to go outside &amp;amp; is not interested in food. He did get up to say hello when I got home, but parked himself back on the couch &amp;amp; has been there for the last 3.5 hours. 

I’m worried about tonight. Especially since he’s not drinking any water. I tried to get him to eat some rice, which he has no interest in. Any thoughts? I plan on calling the vet tomorrow. 

The last time he refused to eat, he was a one year old dog that had traveled from TX to NE to my home &amp;amp; didn’t eat much for 2 weeks, but did drink water regularly. Any thoughts or ideas are appreciated!

Hi all! Rex went to the vet this morning and they kept him for some tests.

I’ve had him since he was 4.5 months old. He clings to me a lot and doesn’t particularly like it when I leave him. He is crate trained and house trained, and I leave him in the crate when I go places (class, work, etc). He is never alone for more than 4 hours, and his crate is plenty big. He used to bark a lot when I put him in his crate, but for about a month now I’ve been starting to give him a peanut butter filled kong only when he had to go in his crate to get him to be quiet, and it seemed to work pretty well. I should also mention that he used to paw at the door of his crate to get out, but nothing extreme and he never hurt himself doing this. He used to have a crate pad but he’s a heavy chewer so he tore up multiple and so I stopped giving him them. I tried giving him blankets to make him more comfortable but he just eats them.

He has a very strict schedule when it comes to feeding, waking up, walks, and bed time. This structure has helped him adjust better to living with me. Like I said already, the barking when in his crate has gotten a lot better due to the peanut butter, and he only whines now in his crate if he doesn’t have the PB. I ran out of PB yesterday and can’t make it to the store to get more, so he’s been without for a day. However, when I put him to bed tonight at his usual bedtime, I found that he was chewing at the crate tray and had broken off some pieces. I got all of the pieces out, but do y’all think this is a sign of separation anxiety? Or just boredom? He was whining a lot before I found he started eating the crate tray.

303,[Fluff] to my dog after our first year together.,dogs,t3_a6scaz,38,False,False,a6scaz,"Baldur, my sweet and loving ball of fear and anxiety,

We brought you home on a trial basis one year ago today, I wanted to get you the day before, but the weather wouldn't cooperate. You came into our home and fit in perfectly, and I was instantly in love. 

I had done a some research and thought I had a decent idea of what I was getting myself into. You had done so well in your last home and seemed like an easy dog, I was so wrong. I wish I knew a quarter of what I know now when I brought you home and I wish I had trusted my instincts about your fearfulness. I did so many things wrong, and for that I apologize, you tolerated my shortcomings and tried your best to do what I was poorly trying to train. Even while you were too overwhelmed by your surroundings to be expected to focus, you gave it your best shot.

I promise to continue to learn everything I can so I can become the human and trainer you need me to be.  I want to help you become the dog I believe you can be and I will stop at nothing to get you there. You have so much potential and you are so smart and eager to learn, I will not  let that go to waste.

I will forever be thankful to you for forcing me to learn all I can about dogs and promise to always help the dog that needs a little extra love and work. I just want to know what makes you tick and how to help you thrive and be the happiest, fulfilled and confident dog you can be.

You have also taught me so much about myself, I never thought I was capable of having the patience you have shown me I can have. I've always thought of myself as very selfish, but you've taught me I can and can even enjoy putting the needs of another living being above my own.

You have taught me so much in the last year, I can't wait to see what you're gonna teach me over the next year!

Happy gotcha day goober ❤

305,"[Help] Emergency vet messed up, what do we do next?",dogs,t3_a767at,11,False,False,a767at,"Story time:

Our dog (Male, golden retriever mix, almost 2 we adopted so not exactly sure) was attacked by two smaller dogs at the park, maybe french bulldogs.  I'm not sure, I dont know breeds too well and this is my first time having a dog.  It was about a 10 second scrap and he seemed ok after.  In my ignorance I didnt thoroughly check if he was wounded since he just walked away as if nothing happened and continued to play with other dogs.  I also did not take down the owners' information which I know in retrospect I should have.

&amp;#x200B;

I get home and I'm washing the mud off him and he starts yelping and freaking out when I'm cleaning near his penis region.  I look and see he has a tooth size hole and some scratches.  Not bleeding severely but there is blood.  He had played for at least a half hour after the scrap with no indication he was hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I freak and call our vet.  They're not open on Saturday so I take him to the emergency vet as their message suggests.  The emergency vet takes him in right away.  They say they its only a skin laceration but they need to cut it open to clean it out then staple it back up.  I agree not knowing any better and they do it.  Surprisingly they didnt need to use anesthesia as Caine is cooperative.  He comes out ok and just gets some meds for bacteria and pain relief (carprofen, cephalexin) and a cone.

&amp;#x200B;

He is less active the rest of the weekend and doesnt go to the bathroom as much as usual.  We thought it was because of the medication.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I get home and notice the entire area is inflamed.  We contact our vet and get him in.  The first thing our vet does is remove the staples because they believe the staples were holding in puss.  They state they never would have put staples in for this type of wound. After the removal of the staples the puss does not come out and now he has to go under anesthesia tomorrow to have the puss drained.

&amp;#x200B;

We are wondering if we have grounds to revoke the payment to the emergency vet.  It is going to cost at least double to fix what they did.  We're going to pay anything to have Caine be healthy again but its just a crap situation right now."
306,[Help] Thinking about returning newly adopted 6 month puppy with strong separation anxiety,dogs,t3_a75ztk,11,False,False,a75ztk,"I adopted a 6 month old puppy this weekend from a shelter and I have found out he has some pretty bad separation anxiety once I got him home. I felt prepared for pretty much any other behavioral issue other than this, as I could slowly working on those behaviors overtime. With separation anxiety, it requires me or someone else to always be with the dog, and is a huge time burden.

I live by myself and work full time and previously was planning on crating the dog during the day and I would come home at lunch time to let him potty, walk, train and play with him. Also, I was looking for an older dog, but got this puppy from the shelter since he had a great temperament and was given up for chasing the previous owner's cats. Now I suspect he was also given up due to his separation anxiety, the shelter said the previous owners reported he had mild separation anxiety, but the house had 2 cats, children, and a stay at home mom.

He was just neutered last Friday so I also can't let him exercise too much which could be contributing to his anxiety. That being said, he can settle down and nap by me in his crate or on the floor, so I don't think boredom/inadequate exercise is the issue. 

I will detail my experience with his separation anxiety below:

The first day (Saturday) we spent time playing and hanging out in the house. I introduced him to the crate (he was previously crate trained), and he would nap in there while I was doing other things.

The first night he was napping in his crate, then I went to bed and he started crying, whining, and howling. I eventually came and let him sleep next to me on the couch and he slept through the night.

The next day (Sunday) I tried to go in to a different room without him and he would get anxious again. So I started working on some exercises from Pat Miller with him in his crate and I would walk around in the room and into other rooms and rewarding his calm behavior.

Later Sunday, I tried going outside for a minute, and the dog started whining and howling immediately after I left, so I came back in. I was supposed to go to work today, but took off because I can't bear leaving the dog alone with his anxiety.

Last Sunday night I left him in his crate and slept on the couch and he did okay, but I think he also licked his incision a bit.

Today (Monday), I tried leaving him a frozen Kong in his crate with peanut butter and moistened kibble, and that didn't help either. He would whine every 2-3 minutes. I came back in when he was quiet and was waiting for him to settle down, but he actually got more anxious and peed in his crate.

I'm really not sure what to do here. Two friends, a vet tech and a rover walker/dog sitter both suggested I leave him in the crate and deal with the guilt of leaving him with his separation anxiety. I don't think that is right.

The options I am considering:

1. Keep the dog and bring him to a dog sitter during this week, and then try to work with the dog over the holiday break. I don't know how long it will take to improve his behavior, but I would guess it will take much longer than 2 weeks. At the end of the break, I would have to decide whether to do option 2 or 3, if he hasn't improved enough that I can leave him alone while I am at work.
2. Keep the dog and ignore his anxiety, since bringing him to a dog sitter for a week only delays the inevitable. This seems heartless to the dog. He should really go to a better home that can stay home with him all the time.
3. Return the dog to the shelter or bring him to a good rescue group that could work on his anxiety and/or find him someone that is home full time. I would think the sooner I do this, the better, so he is less attached to me. But I feel like I'm giving up and failing the dog.
4. Keep the dog and permanently bring him to doggy daycare. Not an option though since it is $450/month plus all the other expenses I already have for the dog.

I am pretty conflicted, but I am strongly leaning towards bringing him back to the shelter. They said now that they know he has strong separation anxiety, they will find a new owner that can be with the dog all the time and help work on his anxiety. I did a lot of research before I adopted this dog, and was prepared to spend all the necessary time to train, exercise, and play with him. I was not prepared for and was trying to avoid a dog with separation anxiety. I feel kinda like \[this person\]([https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/15\_9/features/Severe-Canine-Separation-Anxiety\_20605-1.html](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/15_9/features/Severe-Canine-Separation-Anxiety_20605-1.html)), but I don't have anyone that can help support me with pet sitting, I am not a professional dog trainer, and I don't really have the months of time to work on his behavior.

I would greatly appreciate any kind words, advice, or your experiences.

TLDR: Got 6 month old puppy from the shelter with strong separation anxiety and feel terrible for wanting to return him, but it is probably for him to find a better home."
307,[Help] understanding my dog,dogs,t3_a74pji,6,False,False,a74pji,"My dog keeps jumping on my legs when I leave.

308,[Help] Usually really friendly dog now super aggressive?,dogs,t3_a75o05,13,False,False,a75o05,"Hi! So I adopted this Chihuahua mix about 4 months ago, and he’s my best friend and I love him dearly. We went everywhere together, like the dog park (where he LOVES other dogs, never had an issue of aggression EVER), the pet store (to pick out toys) and he even came to the office with me and almost everyone loved him (the ones who didn’t hated he was there, not anything he did) and we never had any aggression whatsoever except when a woman hit him with her purse, but a trip to the dog park calmed him down and he got over it. Well the details of exactly what went down are complex and not relevant to this tag, but my job was a seasonal job and where I live, the economy is really crappy so I was unable to find another job immediately after. I had an internship that I finished and we were both homeless for a few weeks, living in my car. Well, I moved into my brother’s house as a temporary thing because my boss from the internship offered me a job in another state. My brother has a dog, a girlfriend, and a child all living with him (and me). I knew my dog doesn’t like kids, but he’s been fine as long as I keep an eye on him and stay close by to prevent any biting (because this kid keeps bothering the poor dog, like I’ve seen him get in his face and stare at him and also try to hit him or poke him in the face). The child hasn’t been bitten once. 

Well, this past week has seen some major and sinister changes. My dog gets along well with my brother’s dog and has this whole time, but the past couple of days my dog has just randomly started growling and attacking my brother’s dog (a lab mix). And just an hour ago, he started growling and snarling at either the other dog or the child and I grabbed his collar (so he wouldn’t do anything stupid) and he full on attacked me, scraping skin off my hand (no blood). I had to pin him against the back of the couch with my body. It seems like there’s no provocation (I know there is to HIM, but I can’t see one) . Sometimes it’s ok if the other dog comes near, other times my dog growls and if I don’t grab him, he will snap and start a fight. Same with the child. My dog follows him around and lets him pet him, but if he comes near us while we’re on the couch, he starts growling and stuff, and the only reason he hasn’t attacked is because I grab his collar. I’m scared because it’s getting more and more severe.

Another thing, he does get protective if he sees any form of violence and tries to protect people, especially girls (he saw a friend of my brother’s run at his girlfriend playfully but aggressively and he was about to take him down). Well, a few times when this has happened because my brother has hit me or something, my brother will poke his face or continue to flick a credit card in his face and rile him up more when I’m trying to calm him down. It happened last night until I screamed at the top of my lungs for him to stop (I couldn’t hear over my brother laughing and the dog going insane) and it caused a fight between my brother and I. It definitely doesn’t help and my brother tried to turn it on me for not having control of my dog (when I do, he hasn’t bitten anyone unless he just gets too rough playing and that’s always with me). The teasing hasn’t happened again. But last night he wouldn’t settle down to go to bed and kept getting up and going into other rooms. 

I know the poor guy is stressed and his whole world is upside down with no trips to the dog park or anywhere, but I can’t live with him like this. Do any of you have suggestions? My brother says to beat the shit out of him when he gets aggressive and I tell him it makes it worse and he says that’s when I beat him until he does stop, and I won’t do that for obvious reasons. I don’t want to make him aggressive or fearful of people and that’s exactly what bearing this little dog is going to do. I just hate the changes I’ve seen in this dog, as he’s my best friend and I love him like my child (I’m 19 F and childless accept for my dog). We’ve been through a lot together and I promised I would be his last stop (he had three homes including mine in his first year of life alone, that I know of). I really need some help with this one. I’m thinking of getting a muzzle for him tomorrow if I can, for his safety and everyone else’s safety.

TL;DR: My usually amazing and friendly dog has become increasingly more aggressive after some life changes and attacks my brother’s dog and sometimes child (never successfully, just rushed at him and snapped once, which I stopped from making contact) and I don’t know what to do. Giving him up is not an option. My brother also teases him and provoked him when he’s riled up, which doesn’t help but we had a fight about it and I do t think he’ll do it again."
309,[Help] I'm worried my new puppy is too rough,dogs,t3_a74dcs,6,False,False,a74dcs,So here's the deal. I bought a border collie puppy a week ago (she's 4 months old) I also have a 2 year old Shiba Inu. I'm worried because while they play my Shiba often shows teeth and growls aggressively which makes me think that she doesn't want to play at all. On top of that the border collie is very rough and often bites my Shiba in the neck and ears to the point where my Shiba squeals (at which point I always break up the playing). This really worries me because the border collie is already as big as the Shiba and will soon surpass her in size I'm afraid that she might seriously hurt my Shiba Inu.

312,[Discussion] How strict is United and in cabin pets?,dogs,t3_a77173,15,False,False,a77173,"My girl and I are taking our 7 y/o corgi boy to Colorado with us this week. We figured since he's getting up there in age that we take him to see snow while he's active to cross out bucketlist. We originally we're going to drive there but I decided against the 15 hour drive n are gonna fly there with our puppers in cabin with us and pay the $125 each way. 

I'm kinda nervous about this because as a corgi, he's not big yet not really small, just that awkward medium. After some research for the size of our dog, we bought a XL sturdibag as it was the biggest while being flexible enough to fit under the seat of planes. I have status with United so we will be sitting in economy plus with larger bag space under seats. He has enough height and width clearance to move around but length was a tad short. Bag measures 20"" long and my boy from snout to butt is a bit over 21"" so his nose pokes the front of the bag if he trys to stand straight. He looks pretty comfortable laying though and can turn around if needed. 

There is no weight limit with United but the requirement is being able to move around. As long as the bag fit under the seat, will they give me crap about the length? "

I want to be sure we can provide the care it needs and get the right kind of dog that will feel at home in our lifestyle. I understand dogs are an expensive and long-term commitment and so do not want to make any mistakes. Getting rid of a dog because it wasn't the right fit is something I wouldn't be able to forgive myself for.

I'd really appreciate some advice on the most suitable breeds, challenges and precautions to take.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be our first dog. Neither of us have experience training dogs but are willing to put time (and money) in.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would rather not have avoidable surprises in terms of health and behavior. My boyfriend strongly prefers a pup from a reputable breeder, I personally would like one as well but don't have anything against a slightly older dog, rescue or not.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Our ideal dog is not too wild, relatively obedient/responsible (with training) and not *too* difficult with strangers (human or otherwise). I have a niece and nephew both around 2-3 years old and would prefer a dog that could get along with them or at the least simply avoid them like my cats used to. I want to be able to form a tight bond and do activities together, but it needs to be able to be alone at times.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Our top picks in terms of looks and size are huskies, shiba inu (behavior notwithstanding) and retrievers. We would prefer a medium sized dog. The best match we've been able to find so far in terms of behavior are golden retrievers, but alternatives in both looks and general traits are very welcome.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* We definitely want to train our dog as much as possible but only in things that would benefit both us and the dog in the day-to-day (play or otherwise). I do want to avoid coming home to a wrecked living room, soaked carpet or noise complaints from the neighbors. I can't rule out the possibility of us both working 9-5 in the future, so being comfortable alone for this amount of time is a big plus.

**Care Commitments**

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Early on we're both willing to invest a lot of time into making sure it gets the best upbringing possible. My boyfriend works full time but has varying hours and I'm personally on a low-intensity educational track (lots of days off, 3-6 hours if I do have to go out) for the next 7 months or so. I may start working full-time or part-time after that.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* Neither of us are extremely active but do want to get out of the house more and a dog is an excellent motivator. Anywhere between 30 to 90 minutes per day going on walks or jogs would be fine, although a shorter minimum would be easier to keep up. I'm not aware of any dog parks nearby but would be willing to drive to one every now and then if none are within walking distance.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I don't mind relatively frequent brushing (every few days/weekly). Other grooming activities I would prefer not to do too often, but some maintenance is always expected. I wouldn't mind paying a professional for things like trimming hair as long as it isn't a very frequent (and thus expensive) activity.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* We don't have a very strong preference but do think a medium sized dog would be our best fit. We're not really looking for anything smaller than a shiba.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* As little shedding as possible unless (semi-) regular grooming can prevent having hair all over the house. We're both used to cats but wouldn't want much more than that flying around. I'd prefer a minimal amount of slobber but it isn't a deal breaker. Barking (at least when not outside/overly excited) is preferably minimal as we live in an apartment right now, and have neighbors to keep in mind.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not very important, but I do think it would be a lot of fun and would like to be able to trust my dog not to run off at the sight of any and all objects of interest. Optional, but a big plus.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly for sure! Some independence isn't a deal breaker though.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* We'd prefer eager to please but are open to something in between.

1. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* We would prefer an excited dog over a protective one. We aren't looking for a guard dog and want people (known or unknown) to be comfortable visiting us.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* To some extent, but preferably not.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Any sort of mess in the house. If it can't hold its bladder long enough in between walks some form of potty training would be essential, or we'd have to hire someone to walk the dog for us (would prefer not to). Occasional accidents are always going to happen but it can't be a regular thing. Destructive behavior that goes further than biting up some pillows is also a big no.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Early on not very often and for 3-6 hours tops. Up to 8 hours eventually.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Same as above, it's just us.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets in the house and no plans. Maybe a cat very far down the line if the dog will tolerate one. My parents have two cats but they don't *have* to get along.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Occasionally.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent, but there are no restrictions.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* The Netherlands. Not aware of any bans that would affect us.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Temperature averages vary between 0°C and 28°C (32-82f). Extremes can go to -10°C and 35°C(14-95f) but are rare.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* We regularly go on 1.5 to 2 hour drives when visiting relatives so this should not be a problem when bringing the dog with us.
* We do not have a backyard. Our next house will, but it's about now :)

315,[Discussion] Thoughts on prong collar?,dogs,t3_a71eit,44,False,False,a71eit,"I have a 1.5 year old husky mix who is just NOT good on leash.  Our current method (for the past year) is to stop every time she hits the end of the leash and wait for her to return to loose-leash, but after a while she gets to a point where she's not mentally ""there"" anymore.  I think that the process of yo-yoing is over-stimulating and after a while it pushes her past her threshold.  We have also tried changing directions every time she hits the end of the leash, but that was even worse.  We currently use a front clip harness but I've been seeing evidence that suggests that front clip harnesses can change a dog's gait and cause permanent damage.  Plus, it's just not super effective.  We have also tried a head halter which WAS effective but I think it is actually pretty aversive and it was rubbing away the fur on her nose, and I was concerned about it harming her neck.  She chokes herself out on a flat collar so that's not an option either.   

&amp;#x200B;

We are also having issues with leash reactivity (definitely from frustration at not being able to greet, not fear or aggression), and while I can keep her from reacting by stepping off of the path and funneling treats into her mouth until the other dog has passed I've been largely unsuccessful with increasing the length of time between treats or decreasing the distance from the dog.  Also, because it's cold outside we don't run into as many dogs on our walks so she's had less practice lately and has been backpedaling and getting worse with her reactivity when we do encounter a dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

From the research I've done I think a prong might be the right solution for us and I ordered one yesterday- I believe it is less averse than a head halter or choking herself out on a flat collar.  But I was up all night last night just really feeling like I've failed my dog and second guessing myself.  What are your experiences or thoughts on prong collars (when used correctly)? My hope is that because a prong is stricter about enforcing a loose leash it will help stop the habit of yo-yoing, and in turn it will stop her from going over-threshold so quickly and she'll be more capable of keeping her wits about her.  Is that a realistic thing to hope for?

316,[help] [discussion] Ideas for off-leash exercise other than dog parks for a dog owner who doesn’t have a yard,dogs,t3_a73fmg,21,False,False,a73fmg,"I’m still a prospective dog owner and will definitely be choosing a dog that will be happy with the circumstances I have to offer (will be posting a breed recommendation post in the near future) - I have the time and energy to make sure a dog gets lots of exercise, but I don’t have my own yard and I’m not super-comfortable with trusting other dogs/dog owners at the dog parks around here. (Plus there have been some recent poisonings at the local dog parks)

I had a similar issue with a dog that lived with me in the past (its owner left it with me unexpectedly; I didn’t choose the dog). He didn’t love being around other dogs, so the dog park wasn’t an option for him. We went on walks and played fetch in the house as best we could,  but I always felt bad that we didn’t get to play fetch in a space where he could really run around. 

As much as I don’t think not having a yard doesn’t mean a person can’t make a dog happy, I want to be able to give my future dog an as enriching and fun life as possible, without compromising its safety. 

Has anyone else here encountered this and come up with some creative solutions? (Or obvious solutions that just aren’t occurring to me?) "

It's been 5 months since my dog had her stroke and she's doing......

.....

AWESOME

The first two weeks were really, really tough, I'd say she was functioning at about 20%. 

Her tummy settled after only a few days, which seriously helped morale, but she still needed significant help getting around with a harness. She didn't have energy and just wanted to sit on the couch next to me. We set up a porch potty so we didn't have to go down the 4 stairs down to our street and our nearby grassy area. 

The last week of her confinement she was ready to be up and around and doing things. Her weak leg improved dramatically and her paralyzed leg showed small signs of movement. The vet still said to keep her activities down as much as possible until the 3 week mark, but things were looking up. She was probably up to 40%.

At our checkup then we got the go-ahead to not only stop confinement but to start taking her on daily short walks to improve her healing. For the first month or two she basically functioned as a tripod, but as her bad leg improved she started walking on all 4. But her bad paw was 'knuckling under' probably 80%+ of the time she walked on it.

We got a referral to a doggie physical therapist who showed us stretches and exercises to do with her daily, and how to favor good form over distance or speed with our walks. (Our dog had figured out that running actually took a lot of effort off her back legs and wanted to run through her walks.)

By 2 months after her stroke she had recovered probably 60%, she was able to get around the house on her own and we could take her for walks without her harness, just a leash and a protective bootie on her foot that knuckled under to keep it from getting scratched up. They were -incredibly- slow, under the PT's advice we'd walk for about 30-60 seconds and rest for 10-30 seconds at a time. What would have been a 3-5 min walk took 15-20 minutes. 

We got her a 'stramp' to help her get onto the couch herself (it's a step and a ramp combined.) She could get her front feet up on her own but getting her back legs was a struggle for a while. It actually worked out really well as standing with her front feet upon a step was literally one of her physical therapy exercises to put more weight on her bad leg and help strengthen it, so I'd let her stand there for 30-60 seconds before helping her the rest of the way up. 

By 3 months out I'd say she was at 70% and the doggie physical therapist said that she would continue to improve for the next year but it would be more slowly than the initial improvements. The walks were still really, really slow and mostly knuckled under. She started being able to get onto the couch on her own, it obviously took her a lot of effort, but could do it, which was a big deal. She always wants to be on the couch next to me but anytime anyone goes in the kitchen, or interesting sounds happen outside, she has to investigate. Or she just gets bored and wants to sniff around the house, but always returns to sit on the couch next to me. So she's up and down a couple times an hour. It was SO nice to not have to help her up all the time (she could get down on her own.)

Now, 5 months out, her walks have gotten much faster, almost a regular slow walk with no stops except to sniff things, like normal. They're still pretty short, less than half the distance we used to go before. The most exciting thing is that her knuckling under has almost completely stopped! She definitely has a limp, her bad leg's walking motion is over exaggerated to get it all the way through her gait. But it's so much better!

It's so funny the way different neighbors respond when we go on walks. Some just say, ""Hi"" like normal, others compliment how good her walking is doing, and others say, 'aww' with sad, pitying eyes. I get annoyed at the last one and say that she's improved so much. 

Either way, her quality of life is pretty damned awesome. She's never been an athletic dog, she's always been my happy couch potato, so she still gets to do most of her favorite things. She loves to go on rides and sniff around new places but it's been a bummer because driving somewhere interesting has felt silly when we can only walk a little. 

I've started biking a couple times a week and got a bike trainer for her to ride in so we can go places I was already going anyway for my rides, but we can stop and take our walk midway through. She loves car rides but apparently isn't a fan of the trailer. So we've started slowly getting her used to it by giving her high value treats while being in it, me walking the bike while she's in it, and going for very short rides to work her up to being okay with it. 

I'm really hoping we can make this an enjoyable activity for us. 

So, of course things will be different for every dog. Some may recover more, some less. But I had a hard time when this was all new and wanted to give my experience so anyone else could get a little info. If you find this and could just use someone to talk to, please give me a PM. I'd be more than happy to talk about it. 

Tl;dr: My dog had a stroke 5 months ago and one of her legs was completely paralyzed. It's definitely been a journey but she's gotten so much better, her bad leg is working (with a limp), she can get around on her own, and her quality of life is pretty darn good. "
318,[Discussion] How do deal with grieving being seen as abnormal,dogs,t3_a70i8m,7,False,False,a70i8m,"Please let me know if I didn't tag this correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a rough year. I left my husband in Jan, moved across the country in April, sold my house in May (at a financial disadvantage), and have basically been re-starting a lot of my life from scratch. I won't lie, it's been hard, but I did my grieving earlier in the year, and of course I had my constant companion by my side, showering me with love as always.

&amp;#x200B;

He passed away at the end of November, a month shy of his 14th birthday. It was both a surprise and not a surprise, as the latest hospital prognosis was that he had 1-2 years left despite his many old-man health problems. He passed away, in the night, at home. He looked peaceful.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been just over 3 weeks now, and I'm still a wreck. I took the week after he died off from work  Since then, I've been back in the office, but my mind isn't really all here and it's been noticed. I've also left early a few times (sorry, but I don't want everyone on the staff to see me bawling...). I am a partner in my business so I have some leeway in these things, and I kept everyone aware of what was going on. No emergencies happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, last week I was sat down for an informal chat about keeping my head in the game etc. etc. Then I heard a phrase that I'd heard a little bit around the office before - ""we know it's not just about the dog."" This was explained to mean that they are giving me more wiggle room because they see this as a grieving process for everything that I've gone through this year, not just the death of my Yorkie. 

&amp;#x200B;

At first I appreciated this viewpoint, but as I thought about, I became angry - I already grieved my divorce. This is me grieving my Yorkie. And yet, because he was ""just"" a dog, there has to be some other reason? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know not everyone has such a strong relationship with their animals, and that's okay. I don't have kids and this dog \*was\* my kid. He's been by my side for my entire adult life. I feel like he deserves to be grieved, and I feel like I deserve to feel these emotions. I'm getting therapy and am on anti-anxiety medications for the real freak-outs.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I'm asking for commisseration and advice. Has anyone else gone through this? If you've had a similar reaction, how do you explain yourself? How do I keep myself motivated at work so that they're less aware of my sadness?"
319,[Discussion] 200+ dog foods lab-tested and rated 🐶 How does your dog food score?,dogs,t3_a7bh09,121,False,False,a7bh09,"
Hi guys,

**TLDR:** We just released Watchdog Labs  [Watchdog Labs](https://www.watchdoglabs.com)  - a free resource to help you find the best dog food. 

We secretly buy dog food online and test it in certified labs. Then we create simple ratings that help you pick great food for your dog.  Check how your dog food scores and let us know!

—

If you have dogs like we do, you know it can be tough to find great dog food. There are too many brands, too many ingredients, and not enough trustworthy information.
After researching all existing review sites we found them either hard to use or not transparent, so we decided to do something about it! 

So we created Watchdog Labs 🔬 

**Here’s how it works:**
We buy dog food online just like you would, test it in certified labs and go full nerd on reviews 😀

Our detailed scoring methodology includes lab tests, product quality, ingredients, and recall history. The result? Simple ratings that help you pick the best food for your dog!

**We believe that trust needs to be earned:**
⁃We work with independent, accredited labs and blind test food to prevent any bias
⁃We NEVER accept ANY payments, free products, ads, or sponsorships from ANY food brands. Period.
⁃We’re always open and transparent about how we review (see our About page)
⁃Our ongoing research to protect pets is funded by an Amazon commission from pet food sales, no matter the rating

**Give it a try:**
Go ahead and check your dog food’s score - or check out the [best dry dog food](https://www.watchdoglabs.com/best-dry-dog-food) and the [best wet dog food](https://www.watchdoglabs.com/best-wet-dog-food). 

**What’s Next:**
Watchdog is built by a community of dog lovers (see our About page) and we’re all fellow Redditors, too. We want to grow that community and would LOVE to hear your thoughts, criticism and feedback. (Thank you!) Watchdog is a public service so we want to make sure its done in a way that best serves you. Tell us how to make it better, and we will.

There are lots more features coming soon, including more lab tests for contaminants, meat and plant DNA, and country of origin. We will also add color coded ingredient lists, recall details and even more details on our rating system. Plus, we plan to soon lab test cat food, dog treats, and more! Let us know what else would help you and we create it.

Thank you,
Simon &amp; Tyler from Watchdog Labs

PPS: Home cooking dog food is awesome, but not everybody has the time and money for it. We think all dogs should eat well :)

EDIT:

Thank you everyone for the critical feedback. While posting such an early version of our site made us feel quite vulnerable, I think it was an important step for us to create a truly valuable resource. We have a very long list to start working through. While this is a massive undertaking, we believe that our efforts will, in the end, be a huge benefit to pets around the world."
320,[Discussion] My dog has passed his CGC/TDI test! Now what?,dogs,t3_a71c13,4,False,False,a71c13,"Hello all , just like the title says, I have a year and a half old Shiba Inu who has successfully passed both tests (along with CGCA), however I do have a couple of questions about the process.

1)While filling out the paperwork, there is a spot that asks if f your dog gets along with other dogs? He does, but he is leash reactivate, meaning sometimes if a dog is too close, he will growl and snap at them. However, this is ONLY when he wears a collar. He is fine when he has a body harness on, or off leash (which he will not be anyway, but just trying to explain the best I can). So, because he will be in a harness on outings (the form says a harness is allowed), should I say that he is not aggressive? If I check the box that says he doesn't get along with other dogs, will they deny him the TDI title?

2)Along with the other dog things, I was wondering how often outings are done with other dogs present, or is that something you decide when contacting places you wish to volunteer at?

I guess I'm just concerned about my guy misbehaving. He is very sweet and LOVES people, but still young and full of energy, so I don't think we will start right away. In the meantime, I have been taking him out to places like pet stores to try and counter condition him into not caring about the other dogs around him. It's been tough and tedious work, but the results are definitely showing. He can sit a few feet away from the dogs and bring his attention to me (provided I give him a favorite treat) and only growls if they are right by him and he has his collar attached to the leash. I just don't want to throw him into a situation too fast with a strange dog and have something happen that'll set back his training (or worse, make others around nervous about him :( )

All feedback is greatly appreciated!! And thank you in advance for your time."

I have a 6 month GSD puppy who’s very energetic and constantly tries to play with my 10 year old Shih Tzu by tackling her. This always happens when they are in the same room and my shih tzu always gets agitated and starts barking aggressively and tries to bite and fight with my GSD puppy. My shih tzu is too old and small for playtime. I can’t have them in the same room which is hard because I have to crate my GSD whenever my shih tzu is in the living room and my GSD starts barking non stop. 

We had another Shih Tzu (15 years old) who recently passed away. He was paralyzed but my GSD only sniffs him and occasionally steals some of his food (leftover kibble on his bed)

I am not sure if my Shih Tzu has aggression problems or just too old to play. Shih tzu is very nice to human friends but barks at strangers. Also blinded the 15 year old shih tzu many years ago because of a fight. 

On the other hand, my GSD is very friendly to everyone including people she has never met before. She’s also very friendly towards other dogs when we take her on a walk. Will willingly go with a stranger. Lol 

Does my shih tzu has dog aggression? 

Will she ever get along with my GSD?

326,[Breed] What breed would be right for us?,dogs,t3_a752e8,1,False,False,a752e8,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First dog both for me and my SO, although our roommate has grown up with family dogs

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We’re thinking we do not want a puppy, so probably rescue, or a rehomed breeder dog

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* A snuggly couch potato that will also force me to actually get outside, and that (with a midday visit from the dog walker) will be alright with us all occasionally being out of the house for a full work day. Preferably larger and fluffier. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I love Bernese Mountain dogs and golden retrievers both looks and temperament-wise. I also have a couple of friends that have a greyhound who I just love to bits. Other than those, I haven’t done much research on breeds as I would prefer to be pointed a little bit in the right direction first. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands like stay, sit, lie etc, as well as housetraining and recall. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Maybe 30 minutes to 1 hour in the morning and 2-3 hours in the evening for me, although my SO and I are on the same page about these amounts and often on different shifts, so it could probably be double that in those cases. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I like quick paced walks and would probably at do at least 30 minutes in the morning and an hour in the evening of that. I’m not sure we have any dog parks near us, but I’d love to take it to at least a normal park at the weekend for a longer walk and outdoor play. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing up to daily  is completely fine with me. As for doing other things I’d be willing to either learn or pay a professional. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Mid to large size. I do have a special fondness for corgies as well, but that’d be absolute minimum. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding - The limit does not exist. Barking - we live in a close neighbourhood so I’d be weary of much barking. Slobber - as little as possible (making my Newfie-loving self very sad)

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not particularly. While I would obviously like to be able to do so, it’s not at all a deal breaker

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* All the snuggles please

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* A couple of barks of alert maybe, but preferably friendly to visitors

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. I simply don’t feel qualified to

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* As mentioned we all have full time jobs, and while our shifts most of the time line up so that one person would be off work (although maybe popping out for errands), I do need a dog that would be able to handle the day alone (again with a dog walker coming in) in the event that we should all be working at the same time

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I’m away 8-6 Monday to Friday, while my SO and our roommate work different and rotating shifts. As mentioned, the vast majority of the time at least one of us should be off work, but in the event that our shifts overlap it would be left from 8-6 with a dog walker coming in during the day. As for non-work related... We’re each others’ social lives, so we’re usually home 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* It’ll be my SO and I’s dog, and we are very much on the same page about these answers. As for our roommate, she has no real preferences other than that dogs are amazing and making this face at the mention of slobber 🤢.  She will be helping out as much or as little as she feels like as it will not be her dog, but if my SO and I are both at work, she is happy to take the dog for a walk during the day (or if she can’t, again we will get a dog walker in). 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Nope

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* We won’t be having kids for another 7-10 years, and while we know a child, the dog would not be interacting with them regularly. 

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We are currently looking at renting a pet friendly house with an enclosed garden in our area, which fortunately there are quite a few of. The next step after that would be buying a house (also with a garden). 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* UK, and I am not aware of any, no

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Winter: -5 - 5 celcius, Summer: 18 - 23 celcius

327,[Help] ACD threw up rocks last night. Don’t know how to stop this behavior.,dogs,t3_a71la2,19,False,False,a71la2,"We opened up a a business and there is lots of gravel around us.
My ACD comes to work with us every day and is normally very good. He likes to eat up the grain the horse’s didn’t finish or left on the ground and when we catch him he will stop. 
He also LOVES to grab rocks for people to throw.
He never brings the rocks to us because he knows better, and all the regulars at the barn know better than to throw the rocks for him. We have two balls for them to throw for him if they want to play.

However sometimes he WONT STOP. He will KEEP BRINGING ROCKS to the people even when they ignore him or tell him no. We also cannot just leave the balls laying around because he will NOT stop trying to play. We call him an optimist because no matter how long we ignore him...there he is throwing the ball at our feet with a hopeful look in his eyes lol. When he grabs the rocks and gets anxious to play he gets a little feisty about it and will nibble on the rocks a bit. I always tell him no and he drops it but every once in awhile he will accidentally swallow one. He is not a rock eater but it happens when he’s picking them up to give to people for them to throw m. 

Last night he threw up two rocks and I’m just so worried he will get an impaction one of these days because of it. 

I know this is controversial...but short of putting a shock collar on him to to discipline him (he is very very sneaky. If we’re not looking or if the person he is bringing rocks to isn’t stern enough he is VERY persistent and will not stop) every time he sniffs around on the floor (we try to be very strict with him about eating stuff off the floor. Not just rocks but everything because we feed the horses medication, etc) we don’t know what else to do. He is too smart and knows how to get around people who aren’t strict enough with their boundaries with him and when we are distracted. I’d hate to put a shock collar on him to fix this issue but I’ve seen how effective that can be for him...for example, we didn’t want him following us into the pastures and we were in the process of teaching him to wait at the gate. Twice he got himself shocked by the electric fence trying to come through the fencing. He doesn’t even follow us past the barn anymore after that. 

What can we do? Is there something we can do to redirect this behavior? We don’t leave him unsupervised, he starts finding stuff to eat if we are distracted talking to someone etc. and when we are handling the horses we keep him in the office where there are toys for him. Plus he rarely ever leaves our eyesight, he likes to be by our side. 

Like instead of rocks, chew on your toy? The thing is, playing fetch is his most favorite thing in the world. So I don’t think redirecting to chewing on a toy is important enough for him. I want to teach him to ask for the ball instead, maybe that will help? 

Anyways sorry this is all over the place. I’d really appreciate some help! Our Billy is 1.6 years and everything has been a breeze with him (ACDs are much like training horses 🤣 black and white training and strict boundaries!) up until this point! I’d really love to avoid a 10K vet bill if I can!

328,[HELP] moving to new neighborhood with nervous dog,dogs,t3_a72sia,4,False,False,a72sia,"Hello! I'm looking for some advice/tips for moving homes with a nervous rescue dog. 

Backstory: 
We recently (5 months ago) rescued a 2 year old border collie/blue heeler mix named Zia. She's been such a wonderful addition to our little family. She's very sweet, curious and smart, but she's a nervous wreck. She's been in dog classes and we spend a lot of time socializing her and helping her build her confidence. 

She was re-homed to us via Craigslist due to a human in her old family being diagnosed with cancer and having to travel far for treatment. I can't imagine how traumatic that transition was for her. 

We are moving into a new apartment in January and I'm quite nervous about how the transition will be for her. She's an indoor dog and we get a lot of exercise. We average about 4 to 6 miles a day with walking. Weekends are filled with hiking and running (after dark) at one of the public golf courses. We are moving from a gated apartment community to a historical neighborhood that would technically be considered more of a ""city"" living experience. Our new apartment is not gated. It's on a side street about 4 blocks from the downtown area, across from a city park and 1 mile from the only dog park in town. 

Last night, I took her to the new neighborhood to walk around and sniff some bushes. I think we will do this weekly until we move. We walked by several homes that have dogs permanently chained up outside. We also had a couple dogs (they had collars on) follow us as we walked. They never got too close and if I stopped, looked at them and yelled ""No"" they would stop in their tracks, but it was still stressful. This is very different from where we live now and I'm concerned for Zia's adjustment. 

Can anyone offer advice for less confident dogs and moving to new neighborhoods?  Any advice for teaching a dog to not stare down a growling chained up dog? Any tips for dog walkers who might be used to walking in ""cities"" vs suburbs?

Thank you in advance! "
329,[Help] Puppy Troubles.,dogs,t3_a74k25,2,False,False,a74k25,"Hi, first time posting here, I could use some advice. In the past couple of days, I adopted a 2 month old Plott Hound puppy from a local shelter. He seems fine, energetic, and all around a fun little pup (if a bit of a biter). Anyways, I am having a problem getting him and my first dog, who is a 10 year old, Boston terrier, to get along, in fact, I think he's afraid of the new dog. He constantly growls and even barks at him when he gets too close, often hides in places the puppy can't get to yet (my beds), and even goes to me as if I were going to protect him from the puppy. He's been shaking a lot when in the presence of the puppy, rather upset and antisocial, which is new for him, and I just don't know what the issue is. My Boston terrier never has behaved like this before with other dogs, he's very hyper and tends to go a little wild (in a positive way). I think it's due to the fact that the puppy is a nibbler and may have bit him the first night I took him home, though I didn't see anything like that. Is there anything I am doing wrong?

It’ll be our dog’s first long car ride. We were planning on having her sit in the same crate she sleeps in during the ride. 

We took her on a ride to see how she deals with longer distances (3 hours total). She slept for most of it but did get a bit antsy near the end on the way home. On this trip and when driving local she doesn’t seem to get nauseous or have any anxiety. We do plan on stopping every 3 hours for a stretch and potty break.

I guess I’d just like some advice since this is our first road trip with her. Suggestions on how I can keep her comfortable and occupied when she starts getting antsy would be great!

Thanks!"
331,[discussion] Brachycephaly In Dogs That Weren't A Decade Ago,dogs,t3_a74dyp,6,False,False,a74dyp,"I've noticed a frustrating trend in dog breeding as my own Shih Tzu has gotten older. The breed's faces have been getting smaller! They have always been plaged by Small Dog Face Disease (the teeth are squished, sometimes they may be missing), but since other brachycephalic breeds have become more popular (and their faces flatter) the trend has started to effect other breeds. When we first got Maggie, her face was actually small for the breed. She is not severely brachycephalic, but she has been more affected by her breathing the older she's gotten. Shih Tzus twelve years ago had longer faces, fuller noses, and easier breathing. Now they're all starting to resemble pugs more and more with each passing year. Is anyone else frustrated with this, or has anyone noticed this with other breeds?"

333,[Help] Housebreaking an Adult Dog,dogs,t3_a73yvc,12,False,False,a73yvc,"Hello everyone! TL;DR located at bottom of post.

I recently adopted a 2 year old beagle/spaniel mix and he is WONDERFUL except for the fact that we really seem to be struggling with housebreaking. He was neutered as an adult (and a cryptorchid as well), and I’ve read that that can delay things a bit. He does not seem to be “marking territory” but just genuinely not understanding that he is supposed to go outside. 

He was rescued from an animal hoarding situation in which there were about 170 dogs total, all outdoors in kennels. Some kennels had 10-20 dogs in it, but his kennel was 10’x10’ and just had him and his sister, who unfortunately had to be euthanized due to the worst inoperable inguinal hernia I’ve ever seen, and their only shelter was a turned over blue barrel. So he’s definitely used to being outside in the elements. I’ve been reading a few articles and they are seem to say the same things such as using praise more than punishment, not letting the dog loose in the yard and walking on a leash instead, and if he doesn’t go when he is outside, to confine him to an area (he has a bedroom with a gate in the doorway) and then to only let him out to try to go outside again. We have another dog, a 5 year old female golden mix, and sometimes she tags along on our potty breaks to “show him how its done” and once or twice it has worked beautifully. 

I should add that he has had a bit of a climate change, going from North Carolina (his original home) and Georgia (where his rescue was located) to now being in Ohio with me. We have had some really gross, rainy, and cold weather and I feel as if this may be contributing to the issues as well since the past few days have been worse. Is there something I’m really messing up here that’s causing him to just not get the concept of pee and poop outside = good, and pee and poop inside = bad? I clean up the messes immediately with enzyme cleaners so I don’t think the smell is lingering and he also seems to go in a different spot every time. Fortunately we don’t have carpet, so clean up is quick and easy, but it’s still incredibly frustrating since I live with my parents and will be for the next few months. Please help!

TL;DR : adopted an adult dog that was outside only for his entire life and we are now struggling with housebreaking, and there may be several factors at play. I’m not sure how to fix the issue. "
334,[HELP] Dog has had loose stool for a week and a half...,dogs,t3_a71jzy,1,False,False,a71jzy,"We took our newly adopted dog (two months ago) to the vet within a week of adopting her. No major issues. We gave the necessary vaccinations and dewormer. 

A week or so later she was in the vet because we noticed worms in her stool. In case the dewormer they gave her didn't work, they gave her a different one. They also took a stool sample. The sample came back as negative for worms (we assume the first dewormer killed the worms and that's why we were seeing them in her stool but not in the sample). The sample also came back as positive for giardia antibodies. While this doesn't mean she has giardia at the present time, they treat for it anyway. She completed her 2nd deworming and giardia regiment. 

We gave her the next months dewormer, as scheduled. 

No major issues until a week and a half ago we noticed she was having very loose stool. We waited a week and called the vet. The vet suggested giving her chicken and rice for several days and told us to call back if the problem continued.

I called back today because she's still having loose stool. No vomiting. We have an appointment this evening.

I'm worried there's something major wrong with her. "

337,[Help] How to help my doggy roommate lose weight even though she’s not “mine”,dogs,t3_a73c46,8,False,False,a73c46,"I live with my aunt. She has two dogs, a female black lab and a male cairn terrier. Both dogs are overweight, but the lab especially so. 

I moved in about 6 months ago, and it is a mutually beneficial situation because I pay low rent, and in return I help out with my aunt’s dogs because she pet sits for various clients and is only home about 1 week per month. Which means that the majority of the time I’m the one who feeds the dogs and walks them.

Emma, the big lab, can barely walk around the block before I’m practically dragging her home. It makes me so sad because she is the sweetest girl but she’s clearly struggling. When I first moved in I was just following my aunt’s instructions for feeding. I’m now realizing that Emma is probably being overfed despite being given the recommended serving size on the dog food. I bought her a maze bowl to slow down her eating, and I’ve started giving her less food than usual. Unfortunately I have no clue how much she weighs or how much she needs to lose exactly. I just know that she is too big and something has to change. My aunt currently wants the dogs fed once per day, but I’ve read that 2 meals is better. I also don’t know how to approach my aunt about it. She doesn’t seem concerned about the dog’s weight, so I feel like making a bunch of changes might make her feel like I’m overstepping. "

When did this become a thing? I double checked breed standards and height-wise it seems to suggest medium-large not 150lb behemoths.
The same thing seems to be happening with Shepherds as well. Some of the ones I see look like Sunfish overly tall extremely thin weirdly shaped dogs.

339,"[Help] Looking to adopt a new friend, Not sure what breed/age/gender",dogs,t3_a70oba,5,False,False,a70oba,"Hi All, 

&amp;#x200B;

First time posting in this subreddit, so forgive me if I get the tag wrong or anything else! 

I have to give some context -  I adopted my chihuahua mix a few years ago from a rescue group and she has been an absolute blessing. I love her more than anything in the world. We have been living with roommates/family for the last two years and in August we moved out of California to Maryland (for my career) and its the first time we've lived solo! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm lucky that my schedule is very flexible, I work from home a lot and teach night classes so she's not home alone much. And the days when I have to be out for extended time, I live so close to work that I can drive home and spend my lunch hour with her.  However, I feel like she might be a little lonely.  There are quite a few smaller dogs around her size in the apartment complex I live in, and she seems to love playing with them and it got me thinking that maybe adopting a furry friend for her would be good. Over winter (after New Years) I'll be working from home for about 5 weeks, which would allow me to be home to help a new dog settle in, so I feel that would be a good time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I've been thinking about getting another dog for some time. She's great with dogs (big and small), but when we were living with my old roommate who also had a small dog, she really did not like her. (Her dog was much younger, and very active whereas my girl is very mellow). Which is my main reason for concern, would having another resident dog be too much for her? I lived with someone for 3 months who had a Blood Hound and they got along famously (she was also extremely lazy)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is - would adopting another dog be beneficial for her? I was reading online that perhaps a male dog might be best so they don't have as many alpha dog struggles. Any advice on how to welcome a new dog into a home that already has a dog?  I would like to adopt an older pup around her age (5-7 years old) so they might have similar energy levels. If I do decide to adopt I'll be adopting from a rescue/shelter so I don't have a ton of say over what breed, can anyone give any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Again- Thank you all in advance! Be kind! "
340,"[Help] Shelter dog, Bichon/Poodle mix, is snappy at some family members",dogs,t3_a71whz,4,False,False,a71whz,"We picked up our dog a month ago from a shelter. He's a year old 20 pound Bichon/Poodle mix. When we picked him up, he was high energy and a tangled mess of dreadlocked hair. He loves new people. He had been neutered at the shelter, so we had to wait 2 weeks to groom him while the stitches healed. During this time I can't recall him being snappy at anyone. He was super energetic around new people and loved to jump up on them and beg. Since day 1 we have been trying to train him to calm down before he gets any attention, by folding our arms and not petting him till he obeys the sit command, which we taught him, or at least puts all legs on the floor. Right his haircut, we had to get his ears cleaned out, they had a bunch of foxtails deep inside his ear canals. 

He's all better everywhere now, according to the vet. But now that he's 100%, he immediately developed a bit of an attitude. He now jumps higher and in peoples faces to get their attention. (We still don't pet him unless he gets down). And now, my two oldest kids (9 and 6) when they go to pet him, or when they ignore him for jumping, he has started biting at their arm or leg. He has never hurt them, just puts his teeth on them enough for them to back off (it's not a playful thing). He doesn't do it to me or my 2 year old (I think he understands well that she's a puppy and to ignore her), and hasn't done it to my wife until yesterday. The 9 and 6 year olds are the nicest to him. They always pet him and feed him and take him for walks and to the park. He is their dog that they are crazy in love with, but I think he really only likes me. He wants their attention, but he doesn't get it unless he calms down, which he hasn't learned to do, so he gets mad at them and seeks attention. 

I think his previous owners just let him beg and jump and climb up to the table and feed him table scraps. He is not learning that these behaviors are unacceptable even with our consistency in teaching. He just isn't learning at all and is, in fact, getting worse with the snapping at the 2 kids. 

Is he just not a good fit for our family? Why has he not picked up that he doesn't get attention if he jumps up at us? Why hasn't he picked up that we don't' give him table scraps at the table? He isn't getting what he wants and instead of learning from it, like I'd expect, he is getting worse. "

343,[Help] 7 month old labradoodle with chronic bowel problems.,dogs,t3_a70rrb,3,False,False,a70rrb,"Hi all - I hope (but not really *hope*) someone out there has possibly experienced something similar to our situation that can provide us some ideas...

My husband and I got a female labradoodle puppy back at the beginning of July. About a week after we brought her home, we started to have some problems with diarrhea. We immediately took her to the vet, who had prescribed some probiotics and a weeks worth of antibiotics after doing a fecal test that came back negative. She suggested the move from the country to the city may have caused some bacteria growth. The antibiotics seemed to work, she started taking them and her diarrhea stopped. But a few days after her round was completed, it came back. This time the vet decided to put her on 2 weeks worth of antibiotics, suspecting that the bacteria was aggressive. This seems to do the trick and we had normal poo's for about 2-3 weeks after this. Cue more diarrhea, the vet prescribed more antibiotics (a week's worth) and more probiotics (a months worth). It looked to clear up and the only time we had anything close to diarrhea was after she ate too much bone. The initial food we bought her didn't work well for her so we started feeding her Wellness Puppy. She was never a big eater, she grazed at the food in her dish (later discovering that this was apparently due to its taste). She's never gotten into the garbage, but really liked to eat grass, sticks and leaves. 

Fast forward to her spay, about a month ago now. She had some serious diarrhea afterward so we stopped her pain medications as per the label. We called the vet and they ran another fecal test. A weeks worth of antibiotics were prescribed as well as the suggestion to switch her to some prescription diet food, adult rather than puppy as the vet was worried that the protein content was too much for her. She loves the food, we had both The Hills 'low fat' and 'sensitive stomach', which then turned into us purchasing Science Diet Large Breed as the formulas were essentially the same. It stopped, and came back a few days after the round was done. The vet prescribed another round, two weeks worth which we completed on Tuesday. It went away and came back full force Saturday night. We are scheduled to see the vet today, and I refuse to allow another round of antibiotics. 

She is the most happy go lucky and loving dog, and through all of this her personality has never changed nor has her energy level. She eats breakfast and dinner completely. She still has not been in the trash and still loves to eat leaves and sticks. We've determined she is parasite free. She's 50lbs of love. I have given her chicken and white rice to settle her stomach every time this happens but there is no avail. We were unable to crate train her due to the urgency of these bathroom breaks and house breaking has finally happened, but only when we have solid poo's. Her bathroom breaks are nearly explosive at some times, last night alone she went 5 times (mostly on my kitchen floor).

I suppose my question is has anyone else experienced something similar to this? What could possibly be causing this? We have basically had on and off diarrhea since she's been home. I'm desperate for some answers as she is obviously not comfortable when this is happening to her. "

1. She won’t go potty on walks. She’ll only go in the yard. We’ll go on long walks and she won’t go the whole time, but when we get back and I bring her into the yard, she’ll go immediately and it’s clear she had been holding it. 

2. She often won’t eat treats unless she can eat it on the couch. Super strange to me. I’ll give her a treat that she’s really excited about and she’ll hold it in her mouth and bring it to the couch to eat. She’s allowed to hang out on the couch with us, but I don’t want her eating on the couch so I’ll usually take the treat back and put it in her food dish or on the floor. Sometimes she’ll eventually eat it, but other times she just will keep trying to bring it on the couch. 

3. She paces the kitchen and dining room and licks the floor. We’ve been calling her swiffer because she literally goes around licking almost the entire floor in the kitchen and dining room. Doesn’t bother me a ton, but still very weird.

Her teeth skinned my pinky and ring finger enough to draw blood. I actually didn’t notice the broken skin because it was dark, and by the time I did see, the dog and her owner had left so I could not talk to him. 
The cuts are small (like large pin pricks) and they are not deep, but I felt the dog’s saliva on my hand. 

I cleaned my hand when I got home but I guess I’m mostly paranoid about rabies, which,
I know, I know, is probably pretty unlikely. I have no way to verify the dog’s vaccination status though. 

Am I overreacting to feel so worried? Should I see a doctor? I’m almost embarrassed to since the cuts are so small. I feel like maybe anxiety is getting the better of me here. I know you guys can’t give true medical advice.. but any suggestions are welcome. Thank you

Get this amazing dog as a puppy, there are 4 family members playing/taking care of him with me, now 4 years later 2 of them are dead the 1 that is left works full time and now i am out of high school and starting university soon and probably will either have to relocate to the city to start a job with my university or have a 1-2 hour commute to work.

It wouldn't be a problem if he didn't always, always try to escape. And he can, he can easily bite and make a hole in the fence and leave or dig under, So everytime someone had to be with him for hours and hours to watch him and play with him so he doesn't escape, now like i said i am basically the only one left who can do that and also like i said i probably won't be able to do it soon.

I don't want to leave him on a leash 24/7, he is a husky and should run and play for hours everyday, especially in such a big garden as i have, he deserves it, but i just can't give it to him anymore, not if he literally tries to escape everyday and i have to run after him constantly, i am just so tired of him, but i love him so much.

So basically i either give him to a shelter (I live in Poland, don't know if the situations for shelters are good here), hope someone adopts him, try to find a new family for him, oooorrrr...something a bit more ""drastic""

I thought about buying those electric collars that shook the dog if he gets too close to the fence, i really don't want to hurt him but i also don't want to give him away, Would this work? This would also allow him to run freely the whole day.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
Yes first dog!
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
not really sure about this one. If it matches us well, then I don't mind either
3. Describe your ideal dog.  
An ideal dog would be playful but not too clingy. I'm a gamer and I work 8 hours. My fiance works 8 hours as well. We also have the same work times so our dog will need to be alone for 8 hrs. Exercise I can go for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour depending on fatigue. Prefer one to be easily trained for basic stuff + home training + potty train. Need the dog to do well around visitors and other dogs (just outside). Hopefully one that doesn't bark too much when we're gone for work. I don't have a backyard since I'm renting a 1 bedroom place. We do have a park nearby though. Minimal to some shedding since my fiance is not a big fan of dogs that shed heavily. 
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
German Shepard because they look nice and I've heard they're good dogs all around and have nice fur. Golden retriever because I've heard they're good family dogs and have nice fur.
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
sit, stay, house training. Not sure what type of training this is but I've seen a friend whose dogs followed BEHIND him wherever he went. When he sat down, they sat down. When they were in the field, they walk alongside him side by side, then sat when he stopped. That' to me is pretty nifty. Dogs that recognize you as Alpha. I don't need complicated tricks or whatever.

**Care Commitments**

6.	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
I can devote about 2-4 hours a day to all the above. 

7.	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
30 minutes to 60 minutes a day. Basically running my dog and playing catch or whatever else kind of exercise is good.

8.	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
I don't mind brushing my dog daily. Trimming hair I can do when necessary. Cleaning ears if the dog can sit still.   
I'm also willing to pay for a professional to do it once a week or two weeks.

**Personal Preferences**

9.	What size dog are you looking for?  
Any size is good. Cute or cool looking is good. Like Maltese/shih tzu mix or german shepards or golden retrievers or border collie

10.	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
some shedding is ok. Barking some barking is ok but minimal is preferred. Slobber preferring minimal.

11.	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
very important. I don't want to have to leash a dog all the time. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12.	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
a mix of both to be honest. I get cuddly most of the time but I do want some alone time as well. 

13.	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  
eager to please is prefered but don't mind a 50-50

14.	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
Ideally bark a few times at most. No biting or anything. 

15.	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
not at all. If I'm walking around with my dog, I don't want it attacking others....

16.	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  
Just the aggressiveness and maybe chewing on things it shouldn't chew on. 

**Lifestyle**

17.	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
8 hours at most

18.	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?  
we've agreed on pretty much the same  thing. Fiance prefers no shedding to minimal since she sweeps the floor most of the time while I don't mind any kind of shedding. I'm willing to change my cleaning habits. She prefers small dogs but I prefer big dogs. I'm flexible though as long as it matches our needs.

19.	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?  
no other pets and maybe in 5-8 years I plan on getting another dog.

20.	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
not regularly. Not for another 3-4 years maybe.

21.	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
Currently renting and no restrictions on lease but do have space restrictions. I rent a 1 bedroom bachelor pad. Bedroom + kitchen. So that gives you an idea of my space available.

22.	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
I live in Richmond, BC, Canada. Not sure of laws here tbh. not sure where to get that info.

23.	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
currently summer time gets to about 20/25 degrees Fahrenheit and winter gets to about -5 at most. I do plan on moving to Calgary, AB which gets colder. maybe -25 at most and summer seems to be similar. Dry cold/heat though whereas Richmond, BC has a more moist cold/heat."

350,[Breeds] What breed is my rescue?,dogs,t3_a6xced,38,False,False,a6xced,"Hello all, my wife and I rescued our puppy, Norman, about six months ago now. Since the moment we saw him, we wondered what the heck he’s a mix of. All of his paperwork says something different, none of which we agree with. I think one said lab mix, another said chihuahua. He was abandoned in an open field at ~2 weeks old, or that’s when they found him and his (assumed) brother, so there’s no history as far as parents go. He’s a super cuddly little guy that’s FULL of energy and sharp as a tack. He can fly, I mean absolutely fly, across the yard and through the house. He’s incredibly athletic, very skittish (although that could be due to his abandonment), and is obsessed with chasing the squirrels, frogs, and lizards around our house. He’s around 25 pounds, 11 months old, and is taller than our senior beagle. He’s a little disproportionate with a little peanut head, teeth that are too big for his mouth, and crazy long legs for his size. He’s also obsessed with staying clean, although he HATES water. I assume this also has to do with him being left in an open field with no shelter. 

Here’s the pictures of [Norman](https://imgur.com/a/IbVUVP1).

If anyone needs any more info or pictures, let me know! I’ll be glad to post them.

We're sitting downstairs right now and she's stomping around upstairs so loud we can hear her. She thunders down the stairs so loudly, that we think we maybe should have called her Ella (short for elephant) instead of Evie. Our labrottie is bigger and is just so light on his feet.

355,[Help] I'm worried my parents dog will miss me now that I'm moving out.,dogs,t3_a6z7fh,6,False,False,a6z7fh,"Dog is a mini poodle, 9 months old. 

I haven't lived with my parents for over a decade, but circumstances brought me home for a short period of time. During that time my parents got a puppy in the beginning of summer. I tried not to bond with him mostly because I didn't think I could handle leaving him, that it was kinder, idk. We ended up developing a routine of hanging out and cuddling in the early mornings and late evenings as I was the one who is taking him out for his first and last walk of the day (my parents vastly overestimated how much energy they have for a puppy). 

Somehow in a short period of time, I've become the favorite despite trying not to, even though I spend the least amount of time with him. When he was at obedience school this week, the trainer asked if he liked being petted by anyone after he shied away from her. ""He only likes being held by my daughter."" 

So now I'm worried that he'll be sad and won't understand why I'm not there every day. I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt that I let this puppy get attached to me. I didn't feel nearly half this way when I left behind my childhood dog when I went to college - so I guess this is really taking me by surprise.

So reddit, instead of a day I'm supposed to be super happy that I've finally got my life in order, I'm just really sad. Am I just over-inflating my self-importance to him? I really hope hope I am but deep down I don't think so. Is there anything I can do to help ease the transition? Should I leave something with my smell behind, like a pillow case? 

Basically any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated :)"

360,[HELP] Keeping dogs seperated,dogs,t3_a6rv8a,20,False,False,a6rv8a,"To pre-face, I have a sweet Staffordshire pitbull that needs a new home or a new situation at least.  He has spent the last 2 years (had him for 3) around our small chihuahua with no issue, but I recently had to take in family and he HATES my relatives service dog. Hes very well mannered and follows directions but all that goes out the window if he sees this other dog. It's like night and day. Super big baby and then seconds later, hes snarling and throwing himself into the cage or window to get her. We've spent over a year trying to get them used to each other before the move because we weren't sure if it was happening, so we played it safe by starting early. We took our time. Let them see each other at a distance and then got to the point that he was in his kennel with her in the room. He bellows the entire time he can see her (or hear her) and if she gets close, he goes ballistic. Spit flying, ramming his face into the cage, almost tipping it over in rage. 

Right now, the dogs are seperated. Service dog and Chihuahua in the house and my Staffordshire on our closed back porch with a heater, beds, toys, etc. He goes out to potty regularly, plays a few hours a day, has things to keep him occupied but he's so lonely. He's not getting enough attention out there and worst of all, he's sleeping alone instead of in my bed like he's used to. He hasn't even been in the house for about a month. 

The original plan was to just keep them seperated with doors but he scares us a little. We have children and what if they don't shut a door well or get caught up in a dog fight? He's 70 lbs of pure muscle. 

I turned to rescues and shelters looking for help and that was such a heartbreak. Half said I should put him down just because he's a pitbull. Some won't take his breed. Others are full. I even called out of state. I eventually gave up and posted him on Facebook looking for a good home but instead was hit with a barrage of ""put him down"" and hate at me for ""just giving him away to strangers"". And even if I found a shelter or a home, who's to say they won't put him down anyway? 

He's still here but I'm lost. I can't find him a home, I can't let him live a sad life on my porch and he can't be free in the yard because USPS, UPS and FedEx can't deliver with him loose. (yards fenced but they gotta come in to deliver) He wouldn't bite anyone but hes big and scary and has already been maced by them once. 

We considered things like invisible fence and runs but that's expensive, iffy, and still ultimately not fair to him. 

I'm at my wits end and will do anything I can for him. We love him to bits but the anxiety is driving us all nuts. Any advice is appreciated."
361,[Discussion] What are your stories about introducing a new dog into your home when you already have a dog?,dogs,t3_a6tn9r,15,False,False,a6tn9r,"I currently have a 3 and a half year old Shetland Sheepdog named Cobalt (see my post history if you want pictures). I’ve had Cobalt since he was 9 weeks old. We are absolutely inseparable. Tomorrow my boyfriend and I are bringing home a 7 month old rescue puppy (a little border collie mix who is also deaf... yeah... we have some exciting times ahead of us).  We’re naming the new puppy Tycho. We’re so excited but obviously also quite nervous.

Over the past several months we’ve been doing TONS of research into how to introduce a new puppy to our adult dog, and I think we have a pretty good strategy planned so I’m not really looking for advice here. But I would love to read some stories from people who have been in our position. 

How did you introduce your new puppy to your older dog? What worked? What didn’t work? What would you have done differently?

362,[help] my dog is stubborn about where he walks snd every day is a struggle,dogs,t3_a6tvra,3,False,False,a6tvra,"Ito (pronounced ee-toe) is a 13lb Chihuahua mix that's around 7-8years old who I found in 2012 on the streets of Miami. He's come a long way, but every time we go on a walk, he is so picky about where he walks and plants his feet when he doesn't want to go somewhere. He's lived in apartments almost his whole life in Florida, so most of his walks have been on hot pavement. Which he loves. But about a year ago, we moved into an apartment with lots of trees and grassy areas. He doesn't like to walk on wet stuff, he doesn't like grass, he doesn't like being on the edge of the road (he tries to poop in the middle of the road almost every day,) he doesn't like it when there are too many leaves on the pavement, etc. 


The main problem is that all the poop bag dispensers and trash cans are in the grass or mulch. I obviously have to go there and every time we get within like 10 feet he just plants his feet and tries to pull backwards. If I say ""Ito, come!"" he will take 1-2 steps forward, and I can do this multiple times, but he will never come all the way to the grass where I need him to be. 

It's been a struggle to train him for other things because he clearly hadn't had an owner before. It took like 6 months to get him to stop biting food out of your hand and knocking the trash can over to eat. It took us about two months to teach him to sit by taking handfuls of treats on walks and making him sit like every 40 ft. He usually responds to positive reinforcement like treats, but when I stand in the grass and offer treats. He doesn't budge. He also doesn't respond to negative reinforcement at all. You can say NO loudly or spank him but he could not care less. The best way I can describe it is that he acts like a cat. He likes affection when he likes affection and couldn't give a shit if you're mad at him. 

Since he isn't responding to treats when I stand in the grass, I don't know what else to do. I end up just picking him up or pulling him, but I feel like I just make him even more stubborn. I walk them twice a day every way and it's driving me crazy. 


Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated.

She was eating fine until a couple days ago. I have been trying to transition her to a high quality dog food since bringing her home, mixing 75% Purina Puppy Chow with 25% Instinct Small Breed grain-free kibble. She did ok with the 75/25 mix, but as soon as I tried mixing 50/50, she refused to eat it. I fed her a tiny piece of bacon to see if it was her being picky or a health issue, and she ate it right up. I've tried putting a little water in her kibble and microwaving for 10 sec, which worked for a couple days, and now she's gone on a near hunger strike since yesterday morning. I've gone back to JUST the Purina Puppy Chow ... even mixed it with a little wet food this morning. She mostly licked up the wet food and left the majority of the kibble. Haven't been feeding her table scraps (other than the tiny bit of bacon a few days ago), and have yet to find a treat she will eat. She tries to eat poop outside as well (I've been picking hers up, but some of it is from the neighbor's dog and he just leaves it in the shared yard). She is giving me looks like she's hungry, and mooches my food when I'm eating (she gets none), and she occasionally goes back to the spot where I keep her food dish, presumably searching for food. She doesn't seem stressed or lethargic -- she's playing with her toys, chewing on her bully thing, is drinking plenty of water, and likes to cuddle on the couch. I am taking her to the vet tomorrow for a checkup and to also rule out any health issues. I am hoping the vet will give her something to stimulate her appetite. We are going for a walk this afternoon, which might help her feel hungry enough to eat, but she is still learning to walk on a leash. A wet food diet is out of my budget, so I am not sure what else to do to get her to eat!!!"
366,[Breeds] what should I get?,dogs,t3_a6vjtz,14,False,False,a6vjtz,"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? \* No, my family/I have had several. 2 Australian Shepherds, 1 Australian Cattle Dog, a Black Labrador Retriever, a Dachshund, 2 chihuahuas, a Basset Hound, and a Rottweiler. My father used to own a pet store, and while we did not sell dogs, we had a groomer who I would often assist. Also, my dad has read about a billion books on dogs, and I helped him train the 4 dogs we got after my birth. The Basset was entirely mine, and he was easy to train.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))? \* Honestly, I want a puppy. I want to have this dog for it's entire life. Some of my favorite dogs in my life are free dogs (what some call rescues) and I'm not at all opposed to getting a pound puppy. I just do not want anything to do with pitbull genes. Nothing against them, I know it's the owner not the dog, but I just don't want anything to do with pits, and it seems like most every time i check out an animal shelter, every dog is at least 10% pit.

3)	Describe your ideal dog. \* it can travel with me, go camping, enjoys water, is active, easy maintenance, not many vet trips/costly stuff. Doesn't shed or sheds very little. enjoys downtime too, not constantly wanting to work or play. I like both lapdogs and medium sized. won't go insane if left alone for a day or two, even tho it will be with me 98% of the time.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? \* Rottweilers, because my mom's was an awesome cuddlebug also made me feel safe. Corgi - cute, transportable, cute, active. shiba inu - active, cute, transportable. golden retriever - calm, smart, good with kids. english bulldog - cute. american bulldog - strong, playful, active, enjoys water, good guard dog. Boxer - funny, active, good guard dog. boston terrier - transportable, active. mini bull terrier - cute, active, good with kids

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? \* go potty outside, heel without a leash, come when i call, fetch, some fun silly tricks, \*\*Care Commitments\*\*

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? \* 2-4 hours. I have plenty of time. Too much really. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? \* 2-4 hours. jogging, hiking, playing on our acreage. occasional dog park visits.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? \* yes, i have most of the equiptment, and have done it before. 2x daily brushing is my limit though \*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

9)	What size dog are you looking for? \* as small as a chihuahua or as large as a rott. I do not want a Great Dane or Mastiff.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? \* shedding is no problem. a little barking is ok, but id prefer it only when playing/excited/trying to warn me of something. slobber sucks so less is better but I know it kind of comes with the dog.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? \* HUGELY. I live next door to a private elementary &amp; middle school. we have 4 acres, I would like my dog to be able to roam free on our acreage, without worry of him/her biting a child. we interact with the school a lot, they have goats and chickens and use a part of our property for a garden. \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? \* BOTH. I want a dog who will cuddle and just chill on the floor or my lap, but also enjoys being active and swimming/hiking/ going about doing their own thing at their will.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? \* BOTH. If I had to pick one or the other though, I'd pick eager-to-please. somewhere in the middle would be perfect.

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? \* I would like a dog that alerts me (barks, gets excited, etc) when someone shows up, but is cool if he knows them. I would like a dog who is totally normal around people he knows I trust, and is cool with strangers/other dogs on the hiking trail or at a dog park, but if someone i dont know/is sketchy he would freak out about and bark and growl.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? \* Not particularly. I know this can be somewhat unpredictable/uncontrollable. But I would prefer my dog to enjoy other dogs company. But I would also prefer that if a dog attacked me, he would fight it off, and also that if he got attacked, he would come out the victor of the battle. Though I would hope to not have to deal with that situation.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? \* Ankle biters, dogs that wont stop barking no matter how hard you train, dogs that lick and lick and lick and lick. I can only take so much drool. Dogs that never do much of anything, and dogs that never stop doing stuff. \*\*Lifestyle\*\*

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? \* only when I am at work, which is only about 20 hours a week, midday.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? \* the same as mine. I know my mom HATES dogs that touch you because they ruin her outfits.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? \* My parents have 2, 2 year old Manx kittens who've gotten along with our friends dogs, and I have a 11 year old Bombay cat who hates everyone and everything except me.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? \* YES.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? \* No I live on my parents property which used to be a ranch.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? \* El Dorado County USA and no restrictions.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? \* Winter it gets as low as 28 and summers get as high as 113.

That being said, as soon as we leave my apartment (or someone comes over) her anxiety goes from 0-100. She paces around, she won't lay down or sit, her ears are constantly in the stressed out position. Holding her and scratching her belly calms her down, but only until the scratches stop, and then it's back to pacing. If she does lay down, she pants excessively and eventually starts crying. 

I tried to bring toys to distract her, but unless it's a pig's knee (which can stain carpet and are kind of expensive) she ignores the toys completely. She doesn't like Kongs (or peanut butter) so those options are out.

Lesson learned this time: always use the harness, even if its only supposed to be a 1 or 2 minute business walk in the front yard. I know its my responsibility to keep him safe, and the abrupt dart into traffic could have hurt him, me, and anyone driving that didnt expect to stop suddenly.

Also, sorry for formatting and any typos. This just happened and I'm still shaking with adrenaline from having to chase him into rush hour traffic.

Edit: this blew up, if i didnt write back to you its not because i didnt appreciate your advice and concern..its just 3am now and im sleepy. Been sleepy since about an hour after this went down. Thank you for your kindness and compassion as a community. 

Edit 2: i just hugged my dog for longer than he wanted to be hugged and told him how much i love him because i almost didnt get that chance again. He got a couple extra treats because its been like 12 hours since it happened and the training moment has passed. I just want him to have a happy life and know hes loved so gosh darn heckin much. Teared up a bit typing it out. Dumb sweet dog. Heck."
374,[help] what should I expect with a growing lab/hound mix?,dogs,t3_a6tr3k,5,False,False,a6tr3k,"she can jump super high, she jumped over my parents bed frame thats like 3 feet tall, she can run super fast, and she likes to bark and growl, how can i get her to stop? and what should ie expect from a non pure bread lab mixed with a hound dog?"
375,[Breeds] What breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_a6x6w6,4,False,False,a6x6w6,"1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I grew up with a Bichon Frise and a Labrador. I helped train the Lab, but they were more family dogs. My partner had a Border Collie X Kelpie who he raised and trained, and when I met my partner obviously the dog came into my life too. He was super smart so I enjoyed training him to do a few new tricks, and we developed a close bond. I spent a good few years with him until he passed away earlier this year. I am also a dog walker!

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

We would rather purchase from a reputable breeder.

3. Describe your ideal dog.

Smart but not too smart! Relatively biddable. Able to switch off and relax. Moderately active.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We are very interested in Whippets. We will be living in an apartment for the foreseeable future, so we want a dog that is relatively compact and short haired. We also like their sweet, polite natures. My partner would love a dog he could also take mountain biking with him, but this is not a deal breaker. We understand the challenges of Sight Hounds being off leash and are willing to put in a huge amount of effort to be able to do this (but also understand that this may never be possible no matter how much we train). We like that they are short haired and apparently relatively clean dogs!

My friend also has a border terrier who I like and think might be appropriate for our lifestyle. I like their adorable old man faces! Their size is appealing. Also their terrier temperament I enjoy.

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience. Loose leash walking. Off leash recall. General ‘manners’ (doors, jumping on people etc.). A few basic ‘tricks’ like paw and roll over. I loved training our old dog to do tricks like spin, sit pretty and other silly stuff.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1-2 hours of exercise, then more playing, training and interacting. At least 3-4 hours total. More on weekends.

7. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

1-2 hours exercise. A lot more on weekends. Walking, hopefully off leash. Fetch if the dog enjoys it. Swimming in summer. We have access to multiple dog parks where we live. On the weekends we love to take the dog for outings to the beach or new parks, and play dates with our friend's dogs. We’d also do some hiking and camping. As mentioned above my partner would love to take him mountain biking.

8. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Basic grooming like brushing, ear cleaning etc. we would be fine to do at home. I was used to brushing our border collie at least every two days. We would prefer not to have a dog that needs to be clipped (Schnauzers, Poodles etc.). Whilst we would prefer a short haired dog after dealing with Border Collie fur, if it’s the right breed we would be fine with another double coated breed.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

Small – Medium

10. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding is OK. Barking not really OK (a couple of alert barks is OK, but we don’t want a super barky dog). No slobber please!

11. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Pretty important. As mentioned above, my partner would love to take him mountain biking. But if it is the right breed in every other aspect, then we’d be willing to overlook it

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

We like dogs who want to be in the same room, but not on top of you all the time.

13. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More eager to please

14. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Would prefer no barking at all, but could tolerate a few alert barks if they are able to settle down straight after. I wouldn’t mind a dog who is relatively aloof (polite) with strangers. Our Border Collie didn’t really care for strangers and it was actually quite nice.

15. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No. We live in an area where there are a lot of other dogs.

16. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Incessant barking. Jumping up on people (although I am aware this is mostly a training issue).

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Usually no more than 4-5 hours per day. I work part time as a dog walker so eventually I may even be able to take the dog to work with me.

18. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

It’s just me and my partner who will share the responsibility

19. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets, and will not be getting any others

20. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Rarely, if ever.

21. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We rent. No restrictions.

22. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Sydney, Australia. Not aware of any bans.

23. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer – 25-30 degrees Celsius. Winter – 10-15 degrees Celsius.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We intend to do puppy school and any additional training courses that may be required. Possibly daycare to provide extra socialisation. 

Your suggestions, feedback and questions are welcome :)

376,[Help] Does picking my dog up when we see another dog make his leash aggression worse?,dogs,t3_a6ti3o,4,False,False,a6ti3o,"I have an 8 year old chihuahua and he's been leash aggressive ever since I got him. It's the pretty typical case of he's super friendly with humans, is completely fine with other dogs when both off leash, but when we're on a leashed walk he goes completely psycho when we see another dog.

If I'm able to avoid the other dog by turning around, going another direction, etc, I will, but sometimes there's nothing I can do. He's only 10 pounds but I'm really afraid of him snapping the leash or slipping out of his harness, so I tend to pick him up and wrap my arms around him to control his rage (definitely a silly sight but it makes me feel more in control)

I don't know if I'll ever be able to fix his leash aggression, but I do wonder if it would be better to just let him hash it out on the ground rather than pick him up. Anyone have any experiences with this?

She had significant weight gain, stress, wouldn’t stop drinking water and became very lazy.  She was 66 lbs and was put on vetoryl 60mg (2x per day).  She improved significantly, lost 6 pounds, normalized her eating and drinking and became active again.  At 3 months, she started showing signs of Addison’s disease (shaking occasionally).  We retested her ACTH and it shows that the Vetoryl has overworked and is suppressing her adrenal gland.  The doctor suggested 2 options: 

1. We stop administering the medication in hopes that Ellie’s adrenal glands “reset” and begin working again.

2. We keep Ellie on the same dose of medication and see if her body adjusts to the treatment. 

We are torn because after researching the disease, we are coming across articles that are contradictory to others.  Any suggestions on what we should do and what her dosage should be?"

380,[Help] Is it really as bad as i think?,dogs,t3_a6tyys,1,False,False,a6tyys,"So I’ve been having a big hole in my chest ever since my cat passed away. It was a tragic story from the start - We took him in from a farm where he was abused. He didn’t even get to be 9 months old. I’ve been thinking about if it’s even possible to try my hand at another cat but I’m very sceptic about it because of my dog. 

I had my dog before the cat and I was very aware that the process of them going to get along was patient and hard work. It was... mixed? They often took turns chasing each other and my dog got pretty stressed about dinner. Sometimes they were fine and rested next to each other and could birdwatch together by the window. But a big thing was that my dog had 3 incidents when she peed on my bed during that time..

I know my dog is food reactive and in RARE cases even toy reactive.

I feel so hopeless about possibly getting another cat again but is it really as bad as i think it is? Any thoughts?"

382,[Help] My dog keeps attacking my other dog,dogs,t3_a6su6f,2,False,False,a6su6f," 

I have two dogs: Moose (1 yo Male) and Scooter (12-13 yo Male). We do not know for sure what type they are, but we think Moose is a Boston Terrier/Pitbull mix, and I would not say he is big, but he is at least three times the size of Scooter, who we think is some sort of Jack Russel mix.

Scooter is always fighting Moose over where they can sit, sleep, etc. and I can understand that he does not want to get stepped/sat on, but he is generally pretty ferocious when Moose is around his space. I think Scooter is usually pretty anxious most of the time, because he shakes a lot. We found him abandoned in the woods years ago, so I do not know if his previous owner was abusive.

The problem is, both of the dogs come to lay with me when I go to sleep. This is obviously problematic because Scooter needs his space. Out of my family I believe I am Moose’s favorite, so he is always around me whatever I do. Even though Scooter can go and lay with other members of my family he chooses to get in a fight with Moose over me. Moose never fights back. (Except when they are playing and chasing each other. Scooter never gets ferocious or really bites when they play, and Moose backs off when he does bite.) I do not know what to do about this territory issue, and it has been at the point for the past few months that Moose will run away when he sees Scooter next to me and generally be scared to come over.

What do I do about this?"

Initial neurologic screenings were normal and the doctor said he was physically normal.

**The Good:** They allow visits, they have an application for their puppies, they don't advertise gimicks like teacup poodles, and they seem to really care about their dogs.

**The Bad:** I don't disparage people who make their own dog food, but I'm a little meh that they charge money for the puppy's food even during the transitional period.

393,"[Help] Feeling of ""not wanting to know"" regarding health condition.",dogs,t3_a6vmkn,5,False,False,a6vmkn,"Hey y'all.

My girl is turning 9 next year.  For the past two years we've noticed a small lump slightly behind my girls front shoulder.  Initially the vet told us(since retired) to monitor it and we have been.  It's grown from a half dollar size to about a 1.5 inches in diameter.  When I touch it, it doesn't seem to be painful for her.


After rescuing this dog in 2012 and a near death experience 3 years later(+2K in surgery) which was absolutely heartbreaking......I'm not sure I can handle knowing whatever this lump is.

The vet told me the next step is to X-Ray and then take a biopsy.  It it was something bad, the cost would go up considerably.  The vet was very honest when she told me ""you might not like what you we find"" and that treatment for tumors gets expensive quick.


That being said....I'm trying to rationalize why I'm putting off that x-ray/biopsy.  My brain tells me I don't want to know....and knowing not only costs money, but it takes a toll on my own wellbeing....as I'd probably be worrying about my girl day and night.


She isn't in any pain and outside of getting picky with her food, nothing else has changed.  It's like I don't want to ""ruin"" it for her and just let her relax with the time we have left.

Thoughts?

TL;DR-  Test might turn up something bad...I don't want to know.  Is that morally right?"
394,Anxious dog - help needed! [Help],dogs,t3_a6trmd,2,False,False,a6trmd,"Hi, I’m hoping someone can suggest how to help my 4 year old Patterdale Terrier, Odie.

We have two Patterdales, Odie and a 10 year old (Harley). When we got Harley we took him to socialising groups as a puppy and he’s grown into a lovely dog. Apart from barking like crazy when people come to the door, he’s a very well rounded and happy dog. 

When we got Odie 4 years ago, for some reason we didn’t think to do the same with the socialising and now we’re regretting it. He barks at the slightest noises, and often just walks around the house making a low growling sound. He rarely seems relaxed. It’s stressful as he will bark at the most random times, usually when the house is quiet and everyone’s relaxing. He also gets very aggressive around food, and has attacked Harley on multiple occasions resulting in one of us having to separate them.

It’s frustrating to not know what to do as when he’s tired out or relaxed he is such a sweet pup. Really playful and funny. We have talked about finding a new home for him with someone more experienced in dealing with his issues, but we can’t face giving him up. Just want to help him. "

399,[Help] Neutering a dog with a retained testicle - Currently reactive (not fear) what is your experience?,dogs,t3_a6puma,14,False,False,a6puma," Hey guys,

I think our guys balls are starting to produce way more testosterone than they should. One of them are retained and is not coming down. He turned a year just a couple of months ago and now my breeder has advised its time to take the balls. I myself am getting freaked out by all the stuff I read online.

But what mostly goes on is this: Dogs with fear usually get more fearful or aggressive, however it says nothing about over confidence, for I shit you not. My guy has probably the biggest balls I have ever seen on a dog (not visual speaking), but he is not afraid of anything and will gladly do whatever we ask. Now our main issue with him is his reactivity, it has been mostly been frustration due to not being allowed to greet on the street, and we have been working with this for i guess 5 months by now with pretty good progress. Recently its started going a bit downhill and the past weeks he is slowly starting to show signs for aggression towards dogs that doesn't even look at him. So I guess its time to get his balls cut and hopefully it will stagger some of his behavior as well as remove the risk of cancer. I'm not expecting a full recovery or being fixed from reactivity, but I'm very hoping I'd see some more positive behaviors towards other dogs so he actually can learn more.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

1. What is you experience with neutering dogs at around a year?
2. Is there anything more we can do to make this easier? I dont expect him to be fixed when it comes to reactivity, but my initial hope is that he will chill a bit down.
3. How is the healing process for this? I'm pretty sure I can see both balls so I dont think its going to be an intensive surgery where he has too ""look"" for the retained one.
4. Did your dog with reactivity (not fear based) get any results at all?"

He used to be excited to see other dogs and just whimper and keep walking but it’s turned into crazy growling and lunging towards the dogs when he realizes he’s not going to get to say hi to them. 

My thought is he thinks the entire complex is his territory because we used to live in a house. No idea what to do about this except completely avoid even getting near another dog. 

In the past he’s never had major aggression issues but he’s definitely not one of those dogs you never have to worry about. He had some bad experiences meeting friends’ dogs when he was a puppy so he’s usually a little hesitant at first. We used to frequent the dog park more often and I’d say he only had 1 or 2 dogs that he just didn’t like for some reason and they all got into a barking match. He does still go to doggy daycare when we’re out of town and we always get super positive feedback that he gets along with all the dogs, but that’s usually the case because myself or my husband aren’t there. I just picked him up from daycare today and when I was walking him out he instantly started growling at the other dogs that were waiting in line to see Santa. 

Any advice on this increased aggression? It also happens when my husband walks him too. He’s usually the sweetest dog! "
404,[Help] Dog getting severe GI upset for unknown reason. Should I switch his food?,dogs,t3_a6ukru,12,False,False,a6ukru,"We took him to the vet the first time he got sick. He had severe diarrhea and no other symptoms. They said he was fine and it was dietary indiscretion so we've been really trying to make sure he doesn't eat anything bad outside as he has a habit of picking things up. He just got sick again today, vomiting, diarrhea and a weird dark poo with slimy looking clear mucus in it. I am now thinking maybe his food is not ideal for him. He seems fine at the moment and no other symptoms. 


We've only had him for 3 months. He is 1.5 years old and has all his vaccines. He likes to try and eat other dogs poop outside, acorns, sticks, etc. I am wondering if that could also be because he is not properly digesting his current food and getting all his nutrients. 


Right now we feed him purina pro plan. Ingredients: Lamb, Rice Flour, Corn Gluten Meal, Whole Grain Wheat, Chicken By-Product Meal (Source Of Glucosamine), Soybean Meal, ....

407,[Help] Heeler Help,dogs,t3_a6ubka,7,False,False,a6ubka,"So I am the proud of owner of an insanely intelligent 1 year old blue heeler/australian cattle dog named Rango. Rango was raised around many other dogs, although they were only small canines. When she was around 7-8 months we introduced her to Maui, a gsd puppy who was the same age at the time. They played and had a grand old time, they continued to see eachother several times after that, on and off-leash, but always supervised. At 10 months old she suddenly became very dog aggressive, small dogs, big dogs, any other canine had her lashing out like she was rabid. She hasn't been spayed yet, but we do plan on having her spayed. We cant have her around Maui (or any other dog) without a muzzle or e-collar. 

I feel awful for having to resort to the e-collar, though I hold nothing against the people who use these methods, what's effective for one dog may not be effective for another after all. Her behavioral issues do not stop there however, she gets antsy around strangers even going as far as to lunge, muzzle bump, and even growl at any stranger, she tries to chase after cars, lights (like flashlights, lazer pointers, etc.), fan blades, any loud noises, and small animals. For the most part I understand these behaviors, chasing after squirrels and birds is a pretty normal canine thing and after a quick recall she'll bounce right back to my side after all. 

I feel some of it stems from her lack of exercise which is my fault, but we dont have many places to walk/exercise her currently, our yard is not fenced in, and we live near some pretty hazardous streets (her trying to lunge at cars even on on leash is a hassle). Not to mention the area we are in is populated with many other canines. Walking her has gone from enjoyable to a hassle. I have resorted to doing it only at night, which is incredibly dangerous given I'm rather small and also only 16. But I just cant find any other way to keep her from getting uppity about every little noise. 

I have no idea the cause or reason, although I suspect anxiety, considering I do online school I'm with her 24/7, so she never has to leave my side or worry about me ""disappearing"", this has developed into separation anxiety. Anytime I leave her for more than an hour, (which I try not to do, but emergencies do come along) she will find something to destroy. Be it a pillow or clothing. And it's not like Rango doesnt listen or understand, she knows clearly when she has done something wrong, and she knows all sort of tricks, but I just cant seem to teach her how to stop these bad behaviors. So any tips or tricks? 

(And sorry if I did something wrong, I'm very new to reddit.)"

The other ones I have seen are sweet and healthy and friendly. But I kept seeing this one just wandering and he would stop and stare at us everytime we saw him.

I never tried approaching him because he just seemed like someone's old pup that likes to watch stuff around town. Well tonight it was raining and my husband and I were returning home from grocery shopping. I saw him in the drive way and said hey pup like I usually do and he came to me for the first time. 

Upon seeing him up close for the first time I knew he was in worse shape than I even thought. After a 10 mins of coaxing he came in. He ate some food and hasn't moved since. He doesn't really react to anything other than food. Doesn't wag his tail or anything or get up. I tried to see if he wanted to go back outside but he just stared at me. 

He is obviously filthy and has some kind of back/hip injury. I honestly can't even tell if he's old or just injured and dirty. He seems sweet enough but doesn't really react to anything besides food so aside from giving him a blanket and scratching his head I have left him alone. He seems so tired. I think he never approached before because he's in pain. 

We are taking him to the vet in the morning but I am scared how we will even transport him, I just don't want to hurt him. Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong with his back and or the best option on course of action? He walks stiffly with a limp, you can see a large hump almost over his back legs. Also has swollen paws and a hairless patch on his back.

She doesn't bark, and I honestly thought she was deaf when we got her because of how unresponsive she is, she won't even look at us most of the time when we call her name. Don't get me wrong, she's my cuddly little baby and I love her to pieces, but I've never had a dog like this before.

Oreo is the polar opposite, infinite energy and ready to roughhouse if I so much as glance in his direction. He's the only one that can get her to play.

450,Need advice.. my boxer is acting out [Help],dogs,t3_a6ls69,3,False,False,a6ls69,"So fellow dog owners of reddit.. I have a 3 year old boxer/cane corso mix. She’s a loving, funny ,beautiful creature. She listens extremely well, she’s well trained. has no issues being off or on a leash, isn’t aggressive to other dogs or humans. I’ve had this wonder since she was 8 weeks old.. but recently, probably last 3 weeks or so.. She has not been able to handle herself alone at all. She is house broken, has been since like 6/7 months old but she has been really bad about going in the house when no one is home , in recent weeks.  Now, I just moved into my new place about 4/5 days ago, so I understand if she went once in the house while no one was here. That’s totally understandable, however this behavior started, like I said already about 3 weeks ago, when I was living in my apt. And it’s not like she’s being left alone for 8/9/10 hours, this is literally her going in the house after like 4/5 hours, and she’s always walked before I or my roommate leaves. 

I came home to 3 shits on the first day we left her alone and 2 piss spots, she literally never pissed in the apartment I was in previously, not once. Today, after 4 hours of being alone, I came home to another shit and 2 more piss stains. I don’t want to scold her I know it makes it worse but she literally approaches me and I know immediately she has been bad. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know why she’s doing this. I thought maybe she was just bored and acting out so this morning I took her to a park and played for about 40 minutes with her, obviously didn’t work. Is there a clear reason for this? Could I be doing something wrong? I just need help, I’m not going to get rid of her but I’m not going to make my roommate deal with her acting like this.  "
451,[Help] Could use some advice on whether this seemingly reputable breeder has become complacent and is no longer reputable?,dogs,t3_a6hygy,28,False,False,a6hygy,"A couple of days ago we messaged our breeder looking for information on the dam’s pregnancy. Yesterday morning we received news that our breeder decided not to breed her dam this winter due to personal family issues. Turns out, she misspelled our e-mail address and so we did not receive the message when she sent it at the end of November (I wasn't monitoring e-mails because my SO had just come back from overseas, so I didn't notice). Her kennel’s breeding program has been put into hiatus and I’m not sure when it will start again, which is unfortunate but understandable. We’re a little sad but well, such is life.

We’re now looking at a different breeder, but the issue is that I am not 100% sold on them yet. To sum things up: it looks like the kennel had a reputable past, but it also seems like they have maybe become complacent with their breeding practices. There’s little details that really throw me off and I would appreciate advice on whether they are reputable or not.

**TL,DR - original puppy plan won’t happen due to breeder’s personal family problems; I can’t tell if my second choice is reputable or not, please help?**

**Here are some of the things I like:**

\- Their newer dogs don’t have docked tails/ears; you can choose to not have your puppy’s tail docked or ears cropped (all other breeders we have spoken to will dock tails)

\- Dams retired from breeding after just a few litters

\- She currently has a litter - dam and sire look structurally sound and healthy. Sire is a UKC champion.

\- Information on DCM and hip scores is readily available

\- Old site looks like a typical breeder site and has info of their awards and championships

\- EDIT: Old site also has pictures of dogs involved in sports

**Here are the odd things:**

\- Very strong social media presence - she has Instagram, Facebook, an old website, and a new website. She says photography is her hobby so it’s not suuuuper suspicious

\- EDIT: I \*just\* spotted a relatively recent post on FB of conformation shows. I guess she must not update the website very often? I'm going to start going by her FB instead of the site itself.

\- Raising two female puppies of different ages at the same time (we are in Canada, she went to pick the puppies up from a breeder in Europe, so maybe that's why?)

\- Owns the dams and sires

\- Dam with the current litter has no titles (although her sire was a GCH)

\- No longer member of the national breed club (she was in the breeders directory last year, she no longer is)

\- I tried e-mailing her in the past year to chat with her and get a better feel of the situation, but she never responded. I just sent her a FB message but am not expecting her to get back to me for a long time since it's the holiday season and she currently is looking after a litter.

\- EDIT: Also just noticed same dam gave birth to a litter this past April. Is November too soon for another litter?

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Second doggy, first experience was with the “family” dog that became my own. I was the primary owner, did all of the day-to-day care, vet stuff, training :p

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* No preference

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Sweet, happy-go-lucky and intelligent 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I love collies (my previous dogs breed), spaniels, corgis and terriers! I just love how clever and full of personality they are

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The basics for a well behaved dog, maybe some sniffer training or flyball/agility to keep them occupied. I’d also quite like (if I get a snuggly dog) to do a little bit of emotional support training, but that 100% depends on the dog

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I guess it would add up to a few hours? But I spend a lot of my time at home with my pets, so they’d get lots of dedicated attention

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours minimum daily. Lots of forest trails to explore around me, I liked taking my last dog to the park and letting her run around by herself so if they have good recall lots of free range park time! Trips to the beach and countryside when we get the chance :)

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing realistically a couple of times a week (if they require more than that I think their coat is probably going to be too high maintenance for my lifestyle), tooth brushing and ear cleaning I will do at home. Claw clipping and coat styling I’ll leave to the professionals, happy to go maybe every other month?

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Personally I love big dogs! But probably a breed under 20kg, just to make sure I can pick them up and carry them if I need to

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle anything but drooling :p slobbering on stuff they’ve had in their mouth is fine (it happens!) 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be nice, but not essential 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly! 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* No preference 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* No response :) not looking for a guard dog, I don’t mind shy but not aggressive

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, it will need to live with another dog and I think it would give me anxiety on walks

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I guess whatever can’t be fixed with training or preparation? 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Me and my partner both work, so it will be left alone quite regularly. Never for more than 6 hours though, I’ve dealt with separation anxiety and arranging for people to pop in and check on my dog before 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* As pro-dog as it gets! They’ll help care for them, but it will be my dog and I’ll be responsible for all the major decisions for them

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a dog friendly cat and a couple of smaller pets but we keep them totally separate. We are planning on getting a golden retriever in the future, but it will be as a puppy with proper introductions

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not at all

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent, dogs are allowed, no restrictions 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* UK, only pit bulls banned as far as I’m aware

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Very mild so no issue :p

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

Never, ever done this before.",dogs,t3_a6jyvq,22,False,False,a6jyvq,"So, I live with my Grandparents right now and they have a four year old terrier cross by the name of Bear. In the time I’ve lived here he only asks to go out past bed time if it’s an emergency - he’s a good boy, never soils the room that he sleeps in and has a steady routine.

However, the past four nights on the trot he’s woken me up to be let out. He poops without fail and then comes back in, clearly elated to be in company (wagging his tail, not keen to go back to bed). Routine wise, I do not have much say. He has his breakfast at around 8AM then lunch at 12PM - 1PM. Last meal at 4PM - 5PM and my Grandmother gives him a rawhide chew (small) at 7PM or so.

He’s on three meals a day for diet purposes as put on by his vet (he was overweight when I arrived). He’s taken out at 8:30PM - 9:00PM to use the toilet immediately before he goes to bed and he poops/urinates without fail every time.

Any suggestions as to what could be causing this?

461,[Link]FDA Approves Pexion for Treating Noise Aversion in Dogs,dogs,t3_a6jqqs,0,False,False,a6jqqs,"[FDA Approves Pexion for Treating Noise Aversion in Dogs](https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm626582.htm)

December 4, 2018

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today that its Center for Veterinary Medicine has approved Pexion (imepitoin tablets) to treat noise aversion in dogs. Dogs with noise aversion are sensitive to loud noises such as fireworks, street/traffic noises, and gun shots. Dogs may show their distress through hiding; vocalizing (whining, barking, howling); panting, shaking or trembling; or may vomit, urinate or defecate. Some dogs may damage furniture, doors, dog beds, or other items in their surroundings.

The effectiveness of Pexion was evaluated in a study of client-owned dogs that had previously demonstrated noise aversion behaviors in response to fireworks. The dogs received either Pexion or a placebo twice daily for two days prior to New Year’s Eve, when fireworks events were scheduled to be held. Treatment continued through New Year’s Eve. The owners evaluated their dogs’ responses to the fireworks at four pre-set intervals and scored the level of 16 different behaviors. The overall score for the dogs receiving Pexion were lower (better) than those receiving the placebo.

The owners also evaluated the overall effect of treatment based on previous New Year’s Eve fireworks experiences with the dogs. The owners of 66 percent of dogs receiving Pexion scored the overall treatment effect as excellent or good, compared with 25 percent of dogs receiving the placebo.

Pexion is administered to the dog twice daily starting two days before an expected noise event and continued through the event. It is available in 100 mg or 400 mg scored tablets and is dosed according to the weight of the dog.

The most common adverse reactions seen in the study were ataxia (difficulty standing and walking), increased appetite, lethargy, and vomiting.

The owners of three of the 90 dogs that received Pexion in the effectiveness trial also reported that their dogs became aggressive, including growling towards a young child and lack of restraint or self-control towards other dogs. Certain drugs used to reduce anxiety, such as Pexion, may lead to lack of self-control of fear-based behaviors and may therefore result in a change in aggression level. The label information accompanying Pexion notes the recommendation that owners should carefully observe their dogs during treatment.

Pexion will be available by prescription only, because a licensed veterinarian is needed to determine whether Pexion is an appropriate treatment."

The wet food he’s on now is adult food, but I think that’s more due to not having a puppy formula.

463,[Discussion] Creating a local dog meetup group,dogs,t3_a6igmw,4,False,False,a6igmw,"Hey! So because I'm trying to be more social and crap, I recently started a group for dog owners in my city through the meetup website. To my surprise, people actually seem to be pretty into it, and I have scheduled the first meeting for tomorrow at a local park (We're in the UK so no dog specific parks, just public park) for some casual introductions and playtime.

As the organiser, I'm kinda in charge of making things run smoothly, and I'm slightly anxious about it. Six people have said they're coming, and they've all talked to me a little bit about their dogs already. We're probably gonna do very short on leash greetings, walk around a bit to get the dogs used to each others presence, and then some off leash playtime. Does that sound ok?

I know some of the dogs are a bit anxious / barky when first meeting other dogs, but I think we can work with that. The park is really big and if any of them needs some space it should be easily doable too.

Obviously I would love for Kovacs to have some doggy friends, but keeping it safe and positive for him is 100% my main focus. I guess generally I'm just looking for some tips, opinions, etc? In the future I also would like to introduce activities like introduction to clicker training (it isn't very common around here), nosework games, hikes, things like that... Any other ideas?

464,[Help] My puppy lost interest in me.,dogs,t3_a6exs8,3,False,False,a6exs8," Hello everyone, I've faced a case during this week where my puppy (pug 4 months old) doesn't want to play, get stroked by me, be near me and etc. This occurred after my dog got treated by a vet with syringes due to the allergy. When I try to interact with him, he just walks away. For example, I see that he is bored, so I get his favourite toy out to play with him, but he shows no interest at all. Also, he interacts with everyone but me. What do I do? "

466,[Breeds] Just lost my best friend of 9 years. Have been out of the loop for a while so what dog is right for me?,dogs,t3_a6jci1,8,False,False,a6jci1,"

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first dog. I've had a bunch of dogs in the past and I get enjoyment out of training them. My last dog was a pleasure to have around because she was trained well and extremely loyal. 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I'm leaning towards a mutt this time as my Rottweiler had a slew of health problems so not set on either. I would consider a shelter dog as long as it's a puppy. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* extremely loyal, extremely well trained, enjoys outdoors but also just wants to snuggle up with you, protective of my family, off leash trained, will swim, fearless, is great with kids, I can take her anywhere and not have to even worry about her with other dogs/people/kids. I would also like her to be just at home out in the woods hunting as she is on the water fishing and at home by the baby. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Rottweiler (mine was just so amazing, the only reason I'm here asking and not out getting another is her health problems), Terrier (Staffordshire Bull Terrier, boston terrier), French Bulldog. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Strict Off Leash trained. I used to walk the town with my dog off leash. She would not wonder or stray. Could care less about other dogs or food. She stopped when I stopped. Walked when I walked. We were one. I take pride in that. She was also a therapy dog which is something I would like to do with the next dog as well. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* My last dog was by my side 24/7. My family and I tailored our lives around her. I plan to do the same with this dog. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Short walk in the AM. Hike weekly. Swim weekly during the summer. Dog park weekly if she enjoys that. A baby is on the way so that may change things a bit. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Prefer less maintenance but if need be, I will do it or pay someone to do it. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* I generally prefer large dogs, but I would like to have her for longer then the average large dogs live so I'm thinking of getting a smaller dog. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* bring on the shedding and slobber but I can't stand that dog that does not stop barking. Barking to alert an intruder or the like is fine. barking just because or non stop barking no thanks. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* very VERY important. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* snuggly. Mine was literally sitting on my foot 24/7 for the past 9 years and I loved it. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* eager to please. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* If I'm not around, like a guard dog, Barking, defensive. . If I'm around, friendly. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes. Prefer not to have that though. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I would like a reliable dog, not one that will fly off the hook provoked or not. I prefer a dog that is not aggressive. It is very important she is good with kids as I'm about to have one which means other kids around and lots of kids adventures. 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Depending on the dogs temperament, she could come to work, otherwise I would have to leaver her home 4-6 hours a day on work days.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* The rest of the family are all dog lovers and want a cuddly dog. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets. I prefer 1 dog to dedicate all my time to. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. This is very important as we are expecting so good with young children is important

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We currently rent but restrictions are not an issue. If they should become, we will move. Dog first.

467,[help] how do i get my dog to sleep in her own bed?,dogs,t3_a6hdkr,7,False,False,a6hdkr,"so yeah, my dog had been sleeping in my bed occasionally for the past 4 years or so with no problems. when she didn't sleep in my bed, she slept in her own one that was placed in my bedroom. however, after moving into a new place ~3 months ago she started sleeping only in my bed and then biting on my toes/feet and growling like she wanted me dead every time i had the audacity to move my legs in my sleep.

with that said, she wasn't allowed on the bed anymore, but neither did she want to sleep in her own bed, choosing the hard laminate floor instead. i thought ""well, the doggie bed is almost 5 years old already, maybe it's not so comfortable to sleep in anymore"" and went and got her a new one. surprise surprise, she doesn't sleep in that one either and i just wasted 70€. plus i feel like it would be so much better for her joints and back if she slept on something soft and not on the floor.

how on earth do i get my dog to sleep in the bed meant for her?"
468,[Help] Dog whining non stop! What to do?,dogs,t3_a6hzg8,3,False,False,a6hzg8,"I have a 14 year old short haired dachshund (name's [Aston](https://ibb.co/6YQNKMj)). He loves my dad very much and in the past, his whines meant that he was just missing him (when he was out for work) and would stop whining once my dad was back home.  
Lately, he's been whining continuously for long periods of time, even when he's with my dad on his bed. I have noticed that he also sometimes starts licking the bed sheet while giving out periodic muffled whines.  
Think I should also mention that he injured his hind leg a month ago and was unable to walk on his own until yesterday (slowly starting to walk again himself) so he's been defecating and urinating inside the house itself when not taken out. Other than this whining problem, he seems to be fine as he's eating his food and drinking water regularly. His poop is also not liquid-ish and looks normal so I guess his digestion and all is also good?

Anyway, I just want to know what's happening with my dog and how I can help him with whatever trouble he's facing. Any and all help appreciated.

Thanks!"
469,[Help] took in a rescue and he is biter,dogs,t3_a6g0vq,5,False,False,a6g0vq,"I took in Syler who is 7, because he nipped at my friend's toddler.  My kids are bigger and I have a German Shepherd. 

I thought I could help him and provide a safe environment. Before today he has bit 2 people and 2 dogs.

I was giving him love today, and my Shepherd came in for some too. They got at each other and I got bit by Syler.

470,[Help] Budgeting for adopting a dog,dogs,t3_a6k0yv,9,False,False,a6k0yv,"So long story short, one of my longtime friends asked me if I was interested in adopting her dog. Well actually, she owned him for a while, then gave him away to her aunt when she started having kids, and now the aunt wants to re-home him somewhere else. Naturally, I came to mind, since I doggysitted him years ago so I already have some rapport with him. 

He is fairly mellow and chill, if a bit needy at times. He's a fairly tiny dog, a Pekingese-dachshund mix, and is about 9 years old now. He has sensitive skin, so he has to eat hypo-allergenic food. I myself currently live alone. My take-home pay is about $3800/month. I have a mortgage of $1555/month, and on average $1200 is spent on food/utilities/shopping/transportation/entertainment. Keep in mind, I've never actually owned a dog my life before. How feasible would it be for me to raise a dog?"
471,[HELP] I've found a very feeble stray puppy. How do I care for him?,dogs,t3_a649u0,117,False,False,a649u0,"Here's the situation.. It rained heavily last night. I've heard moaning from the street this morning and went to check on it. I found this very weak stray puppy. I looked for the mother or its siblings with no success. I brought him home and fed him some milk and water using an ink filler/eye dropper. He's not opening his eyes or not able to stand on his own. I wrapped him in a blanket and put him in a cardboard box. He's sleeping now. There are no animal shelters or veterinarians close to where I live. I will take him to a vet as soon as I can. But until then how do I make sure he won't die? What do I feed him and at what intervals? Please help. Thank you.

**Update 1:** I think the puppy is blind, folks. At first , I thought he was too weak to open his eyes. But he is slowly sitting on his own, had some more milk and water, this time without my help. However, he doesn’t open his eyes at all. I tried to open them gently, but they didn’t open wide and closed as soon as I released them. I’m taking him to the vet first thing tomorrow (it’s night here). I don’t think he can survive on his own. Need to find a home for him ASAP.

**Update 2:** Several people have asked for pictures. I couldn’t hold him still to take a picture. He’s taking a nap on my lap while I’m sitting in an awkward posture. Can’t move now. Anyway, here are the pictures. https://imgur.com/a/Iq1Gkom/

**Final update:** He didn’t survive the night. I’m sorry. I should have taken him to the vet last night. 

I fed him puppy milk and wrapped him in blankets. He looked better than when I found him. He stood up and took a few steps. Drank milk on his own. I thought he would pull through. But I found him dead when I woke up this morning. I should have taken him to the vet right away. I’m sorry, little guy. Thank you everyone for the kindness.

472,[HELP] My old dog has started to smell REALLY BAD over the last few weeks.,dogs,t3_a6bv8c,32,False,False,a6bv8c,"My wife’s old min-pin(12 y/o) has recently started to smell really bad. Like “smells like death” bad. 

I took him to the vet about a week and a half ago and they ran a blood test and internally cleaned out his anal glands. Because I thought it might have been his anal glands that caused him smell, the vet brought in the rag that he used to clean the fecal matter from the glands for me to compare to my dog’s stink. I told the vet that it could be the glands, but I wasn’t sure that the fecal matter from my dog’s glands smelled like the stink that’s permeating from him.

Afterwards, I took him home and bathed him, and the next day I got a call from the vet to tell me that the test results came back showing he’s completely healthy and that he had no idea why he might have started to smell so bad lately other than the glands. He also said that because it was probably my dog’s glands that he shouldn’t smell anymore because his glands don’t need to be internally expressed for another couple of months, but just a couple of days later the smell came back and now we’re bathing him every 2-3 days.

I’ve searched all over the internet for reasons why he might have started to smell, but I’m not finding any reasons other than kidney failure or his anal glands. His diet hasn’t changed, we’ve washed his bedding and favorite blankets multiple times and his glands aren’t puffed up like they were when I brought them in, so I’m not sure what’s going on.

Our neighbours have large dogs (German shepherd and a wolf dog I think) which they keep outside. The temperature reaches -6C tonight, and will likely get colder still.

I was wondering what would be good to give them to help them through the winter. Maybe something with a bit more fat?

I’d appreciate if people didn’t simply suggest calling the police/some authority over dog abuse, as where I live this won’t be productive and may get my family in trouble with some of the neighbours.

477,"[Help] I'm a complete dog noob, my parents just got a dog - please help me learn how to get on with him better!",dogs,t3_a6h7yz,13,False,False,a6h7yz,"Hello dog lovers

So as the title suggests... and please forgive me for feeling like this as I know logically that dogs are wonderful companions... but I'm a little afraid of dogs. We never had one when I was growing up and my experience of dogs was a friend of the family's very boisterous sheep dog who scared the bejeezers out of me plus a couple of dogs that chased me when I was very very small. I've never been bitten though, but my main fear is a dog will bite me.

As a result I'm awful with dogs. I don't understand their body language, I feel afraid when they bark and I'm low key uncomfortable constantly when I'm around them.

I'm currently moving house and between tenancies my parents have kindly let me move back in with them for a couple of weeks over Christmas. In November they got a puppy and I met him a few times and he was so small I was ok with him.

But he's tripled in size and being a puppy is very unpredictable, boisterous and not completely obedient (He will sit and stay... When he's in the mood.) I did explain to my parents how I felt about dogs before they got him so they know not to like force me to play with him or stroke him but to let me do it on my own terms. But I'm uncomfortable all the time because I never know if this dog is gonna bowl over to me and bite my clothes, nip my feet etc. He is not an aggressive dog at all - he's just being normal for a very young dog who's teething and hasn't fully learned boundaries yet.

He's bringing my parents a lot of happiness and I don't want to be this awkward and afraid of him - he's here to stay. I can absolutely see he's cute. I can imagine that one day we will bond. But how do I learn to read him and behave around him especially in the short term while I live here? Just spend more time around him? Read books?

TLDR: I'm slightly afraid of dogs: how do I become not afraid of dogs?"
478,[HELP] Dog keeps forgetting to pee on the nappy,dogs,t3_a6j48z,2,False,False,a6j48z,"I have a six month old Yorkshire Terrier and his potty training is doing well so far, but sometimes it seems like he forgets that he should do his duties on the nappy. Most of times, whenever he needs to go, he just walks up to the nappy. But lately its like he is forgetting about it.

My question is this, how can I keep reminding him that he needs to go on his nappy? Because the basics are there. Sometimes he does a solid 3 days doing everything on the nappy and all of a sudden a whole day of going on the floor. He knows that he should go on his nappy because whenever he pees on the floor, he comes up to me looking all sad and scared.

I think that its because he's still a puppy and just wants to play all the time.

479,[Link][News] List of Diet Associated Dilated Cardiomyopathy Articles and Updates,dogs,t3_a6a07r,28,False,False,a6a07r,"Obviously this issue has been on a lot of people’s minds, and each time a new reliable update comes out there is a thread with a lot of anxiety and controversy. Right now there are still a lot of questions about what is happening and what the cause is, but what is clear is that there is a newly observed phenomenon of dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy in breeds that this disease was not typically seen in linked to particular diets.  This seems to be seen in dogs eating diets that have a large amount of potatoes and/or legumes, and may be related to how the body processes taurine when high amounts of these ingredients are present. It was initially seen in golden retrievers and reports were that they were fed grain free diets, but it is now known the issue is far wider than that.

 

There are still a lot of questions on what the mechanisms are, what role genetics play (though this is definitively diet related even if there is some sort of predisposition necessary for the dog to get sick), what foods are definitely “safe”, and what the best actions are for owners. This does not mean everyone needs to scramble to switch, but if you are able to switch or are in the process of switching for other reasons it makes sense to find a food that is formulated by a company with a full time vet nutritionist on staff and conducts AAFCO feeding trials instead of just formulating to AAFCO standards, ideally without potatoes or legumes. Also please forgive me if the formatting sucks I never seem to manage that right. Also forgive typos which I am frequently guilty of missing.

480,[HELP] How do I teach my new puppy to be independent?,dogs,t3_a6ilq3,4,False,False,a6ilq3,"Hello it's been years since I've had a puppy and I finally got my second one. I don't really remember much from when I cared for my first puppy because I was around 5 so I need a little help...

My puppy is 8 weeks old and is a Maltese and Shih Tzu mix. It was his first night home yesterday and I'm not sure if he was just really shy or what, but whenever I would walk to a different area of a room he would sit and whine. He wouldn't even follow me. When I would exit a room he would just stand at the doorway and cry and not even try to follow me. So to get him to stop I would have to carry him everywhere.  At night I put him in a big cage in my room and he would cry non stop. I tried to lay at the foot of my bed so he could see I was there but he didn't stop. So I ended up sleeping on the floor right by his cage and he finally stopped. I didn't want to take him out of the cage because I want him to get used to being inside whenever we sleep. Is this ok for me to do? If I am at my table eating food he will start crying a lot. So while I eat and even as I am typing this I either have to put him on my lap or put my leg right next to him so he stops. Does he act this way because of how young he is? Will he ever grow out of it and what are some things I can do to teach him to be independent? Also, when should I start potty training him?"

They give three different choices for optional bloodwork to have done before the procedure. The first is QUATS, which tests glucose, anemia, and azotemia ($18). The second is Chem10, which tests liver and kidney values, glucose, hydration levels, and electrolytes ($60). The final option is Chem17, which tests organ function, kidney and liver values, glucose, hydration, and electrolytes ($100). Obviously these tests are described in layman's terms, but I typed them as they were written on the sheet. A google search can tell you all of the actual lab tests that are done in each instance. My question is this, does he need it? Money is not the issue, I just have little knowledge regarding dogs and procedures, and I wanted to be as informed as possible. I was hoping for some opinions on what you all would do for your dogs! Thanks!"

484,[HELP] Does adoption regret pass?,dogs,t3_a6cpt2,30,False,False,a6cpt2,"I've always loved animals but have never had a pet in my life. I longed for a dog all of my childhood but my mom isn't keen on them and as a kid we always lived in apartments that didn't allow pets so I've never been able to. Recently I moved out and into my own place with some roommates, and I decided to get one as the landlord does allow pets.

For months I've been eyeing adoption centers and haven't really had it in me to go down to one but today I did and I instantly fell in love with the dog that I'd gone in to see. His name is Jackson, he's an 8 year old spaniel mix and he's truly the sweetest boy I've ever met. His eyes say it all. He's curious yet docile and is fitting in really well here.

This made me feel even worse for even feeling this way and more regretful of my decision.

I'm not jet set on returning him, I adopted him to make him happy and to give him a safe haven but even though I've always dreamed of having a dog I'm not sure that this was the right idea. Is this normal? Am I just a terrible person? I have no idea how to move forward. :("

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dog that has interverterbral disk disease and she's had surgery which was really expensive. I'm talking like I emptied out my emergency fund expensive. Probably because she had to have an ultrasound prior to them being willing to work on her and that made up a big portion of total expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm not here to talk about money.  That was about a year ago and since then she recovered and recovered so well I decided to add a puppy. That was a huge mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

The puppy effectively ""broke"" my IVDD dog and because of that I had to return him to his breeder.  Now, my IVDD dog is broken again and we've been in and out of the vets office for a month now. She's had western medicine and just yesterday she had accupuncture and a cold laser treatment. She's actually doing alot better today, and speaking of which its about time for me to give her her medication.

&amp;#x200B;

I am devestated over all of this. The breeder was really sympathetic and is actually super happy to have the puppy back because he was the pick and she gets to show him now. She doesn't live far away so maybe I can visit him sometimes.

""Dear puppy, I loved you so so much and I was looking forward to a long and happy life together with doing all kinds of fun doggy stuff for you! I am so sorry I had to give you back and it wasn't because you are a bad dog. You are the best boy and I will always love you no matter where you go. Love, your big human.""

""Dear resident IVDD dog, I am so sorry I did this to you. I didn't realize how fragile you were. I thought you were back to your old self. I am so so sorry and I am doing my best to make this right for you so that you can go on to live your best life with me for the rest of our lives together. I will always fight for you and put you first and I'm sorry you were hurt because I made a bad decision. Please forgive me and here take these 8 pills sneakily hidden in some tasty wet food.

492,[Discussion] Can someone please explain this behaviour to me? I am just curious,dogs,t3_a6bke3,21,False,False,a6bke3,"It is greatly appreciated if anyone can explain why my dog did this because I am still learning about dog behaviour and psychology. So a few moments ago, after my dog finished eating his dinner, he suddenly walked to a corner in the kitchen and looked up at the ceiling for a few long seconds. He looked at me too, and then went back looking at that spot on the ceiling. When I followed his gaze, I saw this pretty big spider web (no spider). After I finished cleaning it up, he casually went back to his bed and laid down. I thought shepherds have pretty poor eyesight so he was able to sense it by smell? But why does he care? He has never paid any attention to insects and small animals before. I mean, yea, he acts and thinks like a human sometimes, but this incident was just weird. I am guessing he was trying to tell me about the spider web because it doesn’t belong here? Any thoughts? 

P.S. the ceiling in my house is quite high, that’s why I mentioned about his eyesight. Also, he has seen me kill spiders before. Could this be related?

So I was wondering what crossbreeds were generally healthier. I googled it but there’s just lists of the healthiest purebreds. You might assume that the healthiest purebreds would make healthier puppies but I figure if both purebreds are prone to the same conditions then they’re still likely to get those. If they’re prone to different conditions then you might be putting the offspring at more risk of developing all those so at higher risk of health issues than their parents.

I don’t really know much about this topic. It’s something I was thinking about because I heard mixes are typically healthier but figured some of those are probably healthier than others.

I would include mental illnesses and probably things like aggression as unhealthy too.

I came home from dinner today and saw that my dog had a red rash on his nose. He’s not itching it and he doesn’t flinch when I touch it so I don’t think it hurts or is tender. He also has no rashes elsewhere. 

I’ve called the vet who said it could be an allergic reaction? It also could be just a physical abrasion from shoving his nose somewhere. 

The problem is that I will be flying with him internationally on a 15 hour flight in less than 35 hours. 

Not sure if I should be concerned or seeking medical help with this! Could it possibly be an infection? He’s a 2 year old maltipoo and we live in New York City.

496,[Discussion] Rescues making owners who surrender feel like crap,dogs,t3_a69psz,15,False,False,a69psz,"Backstory/vent portion: My friend recently had to rehome her young GSD after the dog developed pannus and went near totally blind. This normally would not be an issue except that they have a 2 year old &amp; another on the way. The dog had taken to racing through the house despite the blindness, resulting in several serious injuries to the toddler.

This started 1.5 years ago &amp; they did, IMO, their best to keep the dog. They sank a lot of money they didn't have into vet treatments. They rearranged their home multiple times, created safe spaces for her, etc. She wouldn't tolerate being sequestered in any way, indoors or out, and they had complaints to Animal Control about the resultant barking. Under the threat of AC removing the dog (and we know what would happen then), they felt they had no choice but to re-home. They reached out to a local rescue. The dog remained with them while the rescue networked, which took over a month. She never even \*saw\* a shelter environment.

Friend messages me in tears this week because the rescue has posted the dog's photo and a highly dramatized tearjerker story, including that friend was irresponsible/heartless/had dumped her just because she got sick, had threatened to euthanize, and that the 'clock had been ticking for Dog's Name'.  The comments were a dumpster fire of similar bashing on her. She basically got to read a novel's worth of what a horrible person she is. 

This particular rescue has multiple reviews of similar incidents - people needing to rehome and being harassed and shamed. This is not the first time I've seen this either. I volunteered for a rescue for a year or so and their owner was similar - there were a lot of public Facebook/Yelp/Google shamings and slanderings. Some were outright lies about the people. She had a return-to-me type clause - a couple of times, people found their adopted dog wasn't a fit &amp; surrendered to county, because they didn't want to listen to a psychotic tirade. 

I understand the thought process to a point, yes, some people give up too easily. What I do not understand is the knee-jerk, bullying thing. All it results in is people feeling terrible (about a choice a lot of them are heartbroken to make) and giving their dogs to the county shelter instead. 

Wouldn't it be better to gently probe and see if there's anything the owner hasn't thought of? Why jump to telling them they're scum and publicly talking smack about them?  I mean, does anyone go ""Ya know, that mean rescue lady is right, I am a horrible person, I'm going to keep my dog!""    Is this type of behavior just due to fanaticism? Is it partly from rescue people not ever having had to 'walk a mile in the shoes' ?  Do they seriously think shaming is an effective anti-dog-surrender strategy?

With that being said, yeah, she is walking again but now she can’t hold her urine at all and has to wear diapers AT ALL TIMES and she started to take control of her bowels and goes outside or sometimes on her designated pad at home.

505,[discussion] insufferable New Yorkers in dogumentary,dogs,t3_a64r23,27,False,False,a64r23,"I only got to sit down and watch the Netflix documentary series called “ Dogs”  and I love most of it. Most of the episodes are nuanced – even the one about a disabled child getting a service dog has some sorrow and ambiguity about the sister of the disabled child not being able to have a connection with the dog. 

However, I was really irritated by the final episode about rescues transferring dogs from Texas to New York. He made it sound like pet ownership New York is always a dream – all of the footage was of obsessed dog owners doing elaborate things for their pets that the dogs might not even enjoy, like dressing them in costumes Or taking them to parades—while Texas and the south was a hellhole they had to escape. 

Look, I get that the south has a lot more dogs in the shelters, a higher kill rate and some areas and cultures have really bad dog ownership practices that range from not neutering to letting dogs roam free to dog fighting. But I wish there was a little more nuance involved. For example, everyone in the New York team was upper- middle class, young and white (with one Asian exception) and many of those bad dog ownership practices in the south are rooted in cultures that are not those things. Some of the answer has got to be working with those cultures to remove bad practices of dog ownership while respecting traditional dog cultures that are often rooted in love. For example, when my grandparents were dogowners in the forties, letting your unneutered dog roam the neighborhood was totally normal and the idea of keeping them locked up in an apartment or house all day was bizarre. I belong to the same culture as my grandparents and I can not imagine doing anything like that with my dog. Instead of rich white people swooping in to rescue these dogs from supposedly awful people and situations, there needs to additionally be education and change at the root of the problem.

Another potential ambiguity about dog transport, as Amu Sutherland points out in Rescuing Penny Lane (awesome book with lots of heart but also a lot of awareness) is that the rescues are selective, taking the dogs they think they can place, which often translates into young dogs and puppies, and also seldom means chihuahuas and pit bulls. This leaves the shelters with dogs that might be less appealing to locals. I remember when walking my dog here in Texas, a person from minority group approached me and asked where I bought my dog (a schnauzer mix). “I got him from the shelter,” I said, trying to be a good ambassador. “They have dogs like that at the shelter!?” They were absolutely flabbergasted. But they were mostly right. Most of the dogs at the no-kill shelter I volunteered at were pit mixes, elderly and/or weird-looking. So it doesn’t necessarily move me to tears when the protagonist of the documentary says that she has a special place in her heart for mama dogs and scoops up ten fluffy puppies. 

Anyway, I think rescues are great. I think transport is great. I understand that most people are doing the best that they can to try to help the dogs. But I wish they documentary hadn’t chosen to cast a perfect halo on someone driving twenty hours in a van to the south to take cool dogs to a Brooklyn dog cafe. The situation is more nuanced than that. "

507,[HELP] Will I give my former dog depression if I go see him?,dogs,t3_a6d4h8,2,False,False,a6d4h8,"When I was with my ex-girlfriend, we raised a pomeranian-poodle together for over six years. After we split up, I moved to another country, and she took the dog and moved to another city. In the four years since then, we've both moved on with our lives, and I haven't seen our dog in that entire time.

I still stay in touch with my ex, and a few months ago she mentioned that our dog had been diagnosed with a faint heart murmur. He's 10 now, starting to get up there in years, and she mentioned it might be a good idea to come back and see him. Maybe she could even let me have him for a few days.

I'm finally able to take a trip to her city, and I would be thrilled to see him again. I think he'd be thrilled to see me again, too. What I worry about is what his frame of mind will be afterwards when I leave again.

We had raised our dog since he was a puppy, and he had always been very independent, to the point that we joked he was the world's most disloyal dog. Give him a treat and he'd run to another room to eat it. Oftentimes I'd be at home and forget he was there, then I'd find him napping under the bed. We certainly never worried about separation anxiety.

Yet there had been some small cases where we could see it. When we dropped him off at my parents' place before a European trip, he was having so much fun running around their lawn when we were leaving that he didn't even want to come say goodbye to us. Yet when we went to pick him up, he immediately jumped into our car and planted himself there, as if to make sure we wouldn't leave him behind again. 

Another time, I was gone for a week on a trip. When I came back, he seemed like he had his normal amount of excitement to see me again. Yet when I took a shower, I discovered he was sitting in my bathroom waiting for me. He'd never done that before, and actually he never did it again, but I'm sure it was because he was worried and wanted to make sure he knew where I was.

After I broke up with my ex, she mentioned that our dog was uncharacteristically down for a while, but eventually he got back to his normal excitable self. It's been four years now. I love and miss him so much, but he's old, he's got heart problems, and I don't know when would be the next time we'd be able to see each other, if at all. We don't even live on the same continent. 

As much as I love the little guy, I don't want him to become depressed or get any type of mental anxiety when we're separated again. Am I overthinking this? Will he just be sad for a little while and then fine again? Neither I nor my ex are nearly familiar enough with dog psychology to come up with an answer, so I wanted to ask what all of you thought. I'm happy to answer any questions to clarify, and thanks in advance for any suggestions!"

The last couple of days he's been a bit lethargic, but nothing that (initially) I was too worried about.  I finally got worried when he didn't eat yesterday and had trouble walking this morning.  We've been at the vet most of the day and they're going to hold him overnight.

The vet thinks it's either a viral infection or acute pancreatitis.  I'm freaked out because we don't give our dogs fatty food, they rarely get treats that aren't 'normal dog treats' and we're pretty active.  I don't know what could have caused this, but I could lose him tonight.  And I'm so anxious with him at the vet overnight without me...what if he dies and I'm not there to hold him?

Anyway.  I am struggling with helplessness right now and thought maybe someone has been through something similar and/or knows better what might be going on to give me a better idea of what's going on.  These are the results of his blood test:

Glob: High (4.9 g/dL)
ALKP: High (319 U/L)
AMYL (&gt;2500 U/L --- this is why they think pancreatitis, normal range is 500-1500)

RBC: Low (4.8 M/uL)

MCV: Low (69.7 fL)

WBC: Low (1.9 K/uL)
NEU: Low (1.11 K/uL)
LYM: Low (0.04 K/uL)
EOS: Low (0.00 K/uL)
PLT: Low (25 K/uL)

517,[Help] Talked to a Vet Nutritionist today and left confused and lost on what to feed my dog. Hoping you all can help.,dogs,t3_a691iq,116,False,False,a691iq,"I didn’t purposely go to talk to a Vet Nutritionist. Have a pet store near where I live and I realized the lady who worked there was a certified Vet Nutritionist. I was planning on switching my dog off Orijen Large Pup to Fromm Gold with the new grain-free thing going on. I figured, why not? There is little cons to changing, but high reward if it saves my dog from heart issues. 

So, I go there and tell the lady that I’m picking up a bag of Fromm and she’s immediately like, “You always feed him Orijen? What’s up?” So I told her I wanted to switch him off grain free food and she was like, “dogs are not ""meant"" to eat grains, so you would be doing him a disservice by changing him to that,” and I didn’t know she was a Vet Nutritionist and knew more on the subject than I did so I said, “Dogs have coevolved with humans for over ten thousand years and have adapted well to diets containing grains. It won’t be him any harm,” and she was like, “That isn’t true. There digestive track is to short to handle grains”. 

At this point, I didn’t know if that was true or not but I told her about the study to do with grain free food (she didn’t know about that) and explained her what has been going on and why I should change. Now, she understood why I wanted to change, but she said Fromm Gold would be terrible pick because I’d be going from a high quality food to a low quality food and ruin his nice coat. She told me that she recommended for me to feed raw or freeze dried food like Stella or Ziwipeak (since it doesn’t have legumes... etc) and I told her that I can’t afford to do that. He weighs way too much for me to feed Ziwipeak, and I can’t do raw right now because I need to a) research a lot more to make sure I’m balancing the diet correctly and b) I don’t have the freezer space. She gave me supplements to give him, but I’m in college and don’t want to dedicate so much time and energy to that RIGHT NOW, maybe in the future. 

She still insisted that I don’t feed him Fromm Gold, and I told her that my vet said it was a good idea. She said vets have no training in nutrition, unlike her, and they are bought out and educated by big companies like Purina. She continued to say that vets recommend food they are selling like Royal and Purina and no one who looks at the ingredient list would ever feed their dog that kind of food. 

I got a bit annoyed because I have friends that feed that food and I know people on here who do that are incredibly intelligent, so I told her that those brands are able to employ veterinary nutritionists and other scientists and do extensive in-house research and testing of their foods. They also do feeding trails, which is why people feel comfortable feeding them. 

She said that, “You won’t see the affects right away. A young dog will do great on almost any food, but you’ll see it when they are older. I see dogs in here who are 7 years old but look like they’re dying, and they almost always feed one of those big brands (Purina, Hills SD etc). Same with feeding your dog Fromm Gold. You won’t see an affect now, but it’ll show when he’s older. I feed my dog raw and he’s almost 15 years old.” 

I ended up saying I would just take the bag of Orijen home and she was like, “Trust me! You won’t regret it. Feeding Fromm you’ll definitely regret. Do some more research and come back to us.” 

I’m so annoyed. I thought I did do my research and I was ready to go with Fromm, but apparently not. I’m back to having no idea what to feed. Was this Vet Nutritionist right? Did I make the right choice by staying with Orijen? Was I stupid to argue with her, since she is a Vet Nutritionist and works at a pet store so she clearly knows a lot more about this things than I do? She told me to switch to Stella or  Ziwipeak for the best results, should I do that? 

Help would be appreciated. At least I have two months before I run out of Orijen and have to figure out what brand I’m going with"

We have a 10 1/2 week old cockapoo puppy girl called Luna. We have had here for just over 2 weeks now and we have realised she is pretty aggressive. Snarling, growling, biting etc(not just wires and stuff, but biting me and my family).

Please give me any help and advice to try calm the pup down and teach it to be non aggressive. Thank you!

521,[help] Are my dogs playing or fighting?,dogs,t3_a67vt3,4,False,False,a67vt3,"We’ve had our 10-week-old mini goldendoodle for just over a week now, and she’s been doing remarkably well. But this is my first time owning two dogs, and I’m hoping for some insight on the dynamic between the two.

Our older dog is a 5y/o cairn/poodle mix (they actually share the same mini poodle dad), and for the most part, they’ve been doing well. Playful horsing around, playing tug-of-war with the same toys, and even sleeping next to each other already (awww: https://imgur.com/a/9KqN7hq)

But the last couple days they’ve had some pretty intense bursts. Harper, the older dog, seems to be handling Ellie (puppy) pretty aggressively. She’ll chase her around with a constant unhappy sounding (I think) growl, and when she pins her down, Ellie will roll on her back and bat at Harper with her feet while Harper is going after Ellie’s neck, ears, and face. Just now this went on for nearly 30 minutes. Ellie didn’t seem to be afraid - sometimes they’d be frozen in a staredown for 10-15 seconds and Ellie would be the one to initiate another burst. She certainly didn’t seem to be getting hurt by Harper, so I just let them go at it, hoping I wasn’t letting some bad relationship unfold. My gut says this is just playing, even though Harper came off as being more dominant and maybe irritated than I’ve ever seen her. 

Is this normal? Are they just figuring each other out, or is Harper being too aggressive? Anything to watch out for?"
522,[Help] My dog is breathing heavily and lost her appetite,dogs,t3_a69twn,3,False,False,a69twn,"A few years ago the vet said my dog had a low grade heart murmur and to watch out for coughing. 


About 3 weeks ago she started coughing a bit, about once every few days and usually during the daytime when she got excited seeing us return home.


We took her to the vet and upon physical examination they said she looked healthy. Then they ran some x-rays. My dog struggled during this exam because she hates being turned on her back and coughed a lot. 


The vet said her heart was large (and had some fluid?) and prescribed two medications: Aventiclav and Furosemide. 


We waited a few days before giving her the medication. During this time we noticed her breathing more rapidly and heavily. Her whole body heaved when inhaling and exhaling. She was breathing normally before the visit.


We gave her the medication and she was breathing the same way the entire time. The good news is she has coughed a lot less since then. 


She completed all of her medication on Monday. The Furosemide a few days earlier then the Aventiclav. 


She lost her appetite right after the final Aventiclav tablet. She will no longer eat her dog food but still drinks a lot of water. We tried giving her soft human food like peas and rice but she only ate a very small amount.


Another change in behavior is she often just sits there. Whether inside or outside on the snow. 


We took her to the vet again yesterday. They said the heavy breathing and loss of appetite is due to pain from her bad teeth. 


They prescribed more medication: Clinacin and Tramadol. Also sold us some cans of wet food: Royal Canin Recovery RS Veterinary Diet.


We gave her one of the pain control pills (Tramadol) last night. Since then she only ate a spoonful of the canned food and a handful of peas. Tonight I am going to try to give her some chicken.

**Summary: The only issue she had before was some coughing which has now gone away. After seeing the vet, she is breathing rapidly and then lost her appetite right after finishing her antibiotic (Aventiclav). Any help or insight would be appreciated.**"
523,[HELP] [DISCUSSION] Finding a reputable husky breeder?,dogs,t3_a69pfh,12,False,False,a69pfh,"Hey everyone!  My husband and I have decided that we'd like to eventually get a husky puppy.  To clarify, we do not intend to get a puppy for a while (years).  However, we'd like to start educating ourselves on the process of finding a reputable breeder for when the time comes and we are ready.  To preface some comments that I expect to receive, we are aware that huskies require a great deal of exercise and are independent and at times challenging dogs.  We currently have a dog (a mutt, who we adopted) and we would be going into any husky ownership with a full understanding of the needs of a husky. We would not bring a husky into our family until we were 100% sure we were equipped to provide the puppy with the exercise, space, training, and attention necessary for a happy and healthy life.

With that said, I have only ever adopted dogs in the past, so I'm not sure of how to narrow down a reputable breeder.  Does anyone have resources or tips for finding breeders?  It is very important to us to get a puppy from someone who cares about the health and happiness of the dogs they are breeding. Again, we are possibly years off from this decision so we have a lot of time to do research and make sure we are educated.  We're just not sure where to start.  For what it's worth, we currently live in the Midwest region of the US.

Thanks!"
524,[HELP] Whining is ruining my relationship with my dad,dogs,t3_a69hfk,5,False,False,a69hfk,"A little background information: I'm a 22 year old student still living with the parents (unfortunately) and struggle a lot with depression. A few months ago I got an Australian Shepherd puppy (Blue) as a birthday gift, hoping it would force me to be active and not sit around depressed all day. It has worked great and I have started to come out of my hole, until recently.

Blue is almost 8 months old and overall is a great dog. He's super smart and listens very well (for the most part). The problem is he whines ALL THE TIME. I know he wants attention or someone to play with, which isn't an issue, but I can't give him attention 24/7. He gets plenty of attention and time to run around and play outside, so activity level isn't a problem. My dad gets furious when he whines though. I constantly have to give in and entertain Blue otherwise my dad will yell at both Blue and I. I know this is a slippery slope where he will learn that if he whines he'll get whatever he wants, but it's gotten to the point where it's really starting to affect my relationship with my dad. I have tried to tell him that sometimes we need to ignore Blue or he'll start to take advantage of me giving in, but whenever I try to tell him something like that it turns into a shouting match with him saying, ""Stop telling me what to do. You don't know what you're talking about."" I've tried to send him articles about what to do, but it just escalates the issue. I know the whining is just normal dog behavior, but I'm worried that my giving in will get to the point where Blue won't ever learn that he won't always get his way.

I'm at a loss for what to do now. It's really been affecting me both mentally and emotionally. I need some advice on where to go from here. I've started to slip back into my depression because of this, which is the exact opposite of what I wanted by getting a puppy. If anybody knows a way to navigate this it would be greatly appreciated."

527,[HELP] Collie mix is constantly anxious after our other dog passed away suddenly,dogs,t3_a6634v,3,False,False,a6634v,"Last March, my husband and I adopted Ella, a collie mix (probably), from the humane society. She was about 4 months old at the time. We also had a 4-year-old Golden Retriever (Diego). Ella was very shy and timid at first, but came around quickly and bonded right away with Diego. They were pretty much inseparable after a week. Compared to Diego, who was very confident and excited about everything, Ella was still timid, but she seemed to enjoy her life and settled into our family nicely. ([Here's a picture of the two together](https://imgur.com/Y0QvXIx)) 

Things changed, however, in October. Diego collapsed while playing with Ella and despite our best attempts at CPR and rushing to the emergency vet clinic he didn't make it (the vet suspects dilated cardiomyopathy but can't quite confirm it. But that's a topic for a different day). Diego's sudden death was very traumatic for all of us and we are still trying to make sense of everything, but is was especially hard for Ella. She reverted back to how she was when we first got her, meaning that she would barely let anyone but me touch her, she would hide at the slightest noises that previously did not seem to bug her, etc. She was suddenly afraid to go on walks and it took her a good week or so before she would walk with me without just dropping to the ground, cowering. 

We immediately started working with her to show her that she will be okay even without Diego. We also did not leave her alone even for a little bit for a few weeks (I work days, my husband works nights, so there is always someone in the house and Ella has access to us 24/7). A few weeks ago now, we did get another dog, Kona. Kona is now a 15 week old Newfie puppy. We were hoping that a little canine companionship would help Ella in her struggles. The first few days were a littler rough, but now Kona and Ella get along great for the most part. We make sure that Ella always has a place to retreat from the puppy, in case Kona gets too much, but more often than not Ella is the one initiating play, especially when they are both out in the yard. We also make sure that she gets plenty of individual attention.

Still, Ella's anxiety has continuously gotten worse. We are at a point, where pretty much anything freaks her out, even inside the house. Walking anywhere that is not our usual route will freak her out as well and she starts shaking/cowering with her tail between her legs. Here are some other things we tried:

* Exercise: We made sure to take her on plenty of walks once she was willing to come with us again. We were also playing with her more than ever in our fenced in yard.
* Socialization: I've always taken Ella and Diego on pack walks with 2-3 other dogs, so we continued to do that, hoping that giving her the opportunity to be with other dogs would help her regain her confidence. We also had plenty of play dates with my in-laws' dog. 
* Training: I have not taken her to formal obedience classes but have worked on obedience with her a lot ever since we got her. I continued to do that after Diego passed. I also enrolled her in a foundation for agility class that we now go to once a week. Turns out Ella is WAY too afraid to do anything during the lessons, so our weekly sessions consist of rewarding her for any tiny act of bravery (like going up to a stranger, sniffing one of the obstacles) and I work with her on the actual agility stuff at home, which she loves!
* Medication:  We wanted to avoid any medication for as long as possible. But when we did not see any improvement in her behavior, we started her on Composure. We tried that for several weeks, without any noticeable difference. A few days ago, stopped giving her the Composure and are trying CBD oil. So far, we are not seeing a difference, but I am aware that the effects might take a while to kick in. 

We are pretty much at our wits end here. Ella is clearly uncomfortable and it breaks my heart daily. My next step will be to take her to the vet, but I am hesitant to give her any actual medications and our budget is stretched thin after all the medical expenses for Diego and the training costs for Ella and Kona. 

I would appreciate any suggestions on what else I could do to make her more comfortable!"

531,"[Help] New shelter puppy has giardia, worms, and potentially an infection/skin disease",dogs,t3_a66ikf,5,False,False,a66ikf,"Hey all. We picked up our new black lab mix puppy, Benson, from a small shelter a week and a half ago. He is the sweetest puppy of all time and we love him so much.

He had a spot of missing fur on his ear that we were told at the shelter was some sort of healing wound, perhaps a bite. We didn't think anything of it, other than feeling sorry for our poor boy, and took him to his first vet appointment this past Tuesday. We were told there that that this spot wasn't a bite but was potentially mange or ringworm. The vet put him on a regimen of Drontal Plus and we're putting hydrocortisone on the spot twice per day. He also tested positive for giardia, roundworm, and whipworm. He's on metronidazole and Panacur-C now, too.

Am I right to be annoyed with this shelter? I know worms are very common in puppies, but is it common to have a puppy with ALL of these things?

I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac and am upset/disappointed with myself that this is making me think twice before snuggling with my puppy, letting him give me kisses, etc. I still do (with the exception of face kisses), but there's that omnipresent fear now that I'll catch roundworm and develop some sort of horrible brain disorder because of it. Any advice here? Cleaning regimens I should follow? I've washed all of his bedding, our bedding (he's been in our bed for a few minutes a couple times), swiffered the floors, and bleached his toys. Should we do this again? How often? We're also wiping his paws with a baby wipe whenever he comes inside and wiping his butt with a baby wipe when he poops, too.

Another also - we really wanted to bring him to puppy kindergarten to start to socialize him, which it now looks like we'll be unable to do. We're going home for Christmas, too, and were so looking forward to introducing him to our extended families and having him play with the other dogs in the family. Not sure what to do there, now.

tl;dr puppy has a plethora of parasites and infections and am feeling angry with the shelter and also upset with my hypochondriac self. Concerned about socialization and holidays with the family, too."

Tomorrow I am having friends over who haven’t been over since he was a puppy, and while none of them personally have big dogs, one of them especially is a little weary. We discussed other locations but everyone said they are okay with coming over. I have an 80 lb 1 y/o GSD who has calmed down immensely and is normally well behaved but still gets very excited about guests coming over. He is pretty good about not jumping but he’s not 100%.

Our plan right now is to send him to daycare during the day, but they are only open until 5 on weekends. When we pick him up I plan on not letting him sleep for too long and keeping him active until they come over. Typically, if he does jump it is only during first greetings and then he will never do it again for the duration of their stay. If he gets annoying I plan on baby gating him in whatever room we’re not in with a kong/bully stick but he usually hates that and will bark. 

Does anyone have any special tips that have been successful for them?"

I've seen bad and good reviews of every brand that I've looked at, I've also talked to my vet.  Bear's 3 and pretty much done growing, he's a livestock protector mainly, and quite athletic.  He's been health checked for anything possibly hereditary, or issues with the breed mix.

He is free-fed due to the fact that he's working a lot and burns it off quickly, and the vet would be stoked if he gained around 5-10 lbs as it is. And he eats a lot. He doesn't gorge all at once, but he'll eat several times a day between checking the perimeter and lying down/playing with the animals.

One of the brands my vet likes is Blue Buffalo, I've been feeding him the Rocky Mountain Recipe with red meat for large breeds. But that's becoming expensive as hell (&gt;$100 a month for winter months).

She also suggested Nutro or Science Diet as alternatives.

Bear also regularly hunts rabbits, especially since his own pet rabbit lured them in for him. Even free fed, the brat gets extra (We live in the country, without any close neighbours).

540,[Help] Is this just how dogs are? Does it get better? :(,dogs,t3_a69psf,8,False,False,a69psf,"Okay so, bear with me here. This is gonna be long. And I'm using a throwaway because I'm embarrassed.

I got a puppy 6 weeks ago. I've waited years upon years to get a dog. I grew up with them (my mom was a trainer/had show dogs as well as regular old pet dogs, my family members all had dogs, etc), and I've had one in my adult years - although I had to give him up once I got unexpectedly pregnant about seven years ago and our financial situation changed, so we had to move to an apartment. That dog actually ended up getting the best home ever, we're still in touch with his now-owners, and we even got to see him this year. We miss him all the time, but he's happy and his owners love him more than anything.

So I waited for quite a while until our life was super settled, kids were older, etc to get another dog. I researched breeds, watched every training video on YouTube, bought training books, read articles, and have just generally been EXTREMELY excited for the day I'd be able to do this. For years.

I decided on a Great Pyrenees because I like larger dogs, they're known to be gentle with kids/small animals (I have cats), they're gorgeous, they're sweet... lots of good things.

And then a couple months ago I started looking into rescues. The ones I dealt with weren't great and either didn't get back to me, changed their minds about whether or not the dogs were okay with cats/kids or not, and just kinda seemed like they were disorganized or understaffed. While I was waiting to hear back for the millionth time, I got the opportunity to get a puppy from a farm in another state, which wasn't ideal since I wanted to rescue an older dog, but I thought a puppy could get used to the idea of living with my cats and kids and grow up with them, so to speak. Our last dog that we re-homed was a puppy, and he was great! So I figured it would be fine.

...

Well here we are, and I'm not putting this lightly: I don't even LIKE this dog.

Every single second he's awake, he's doing something I simply cannot deal with. He wakes up in the morning and pees in the house (in his crate, if he's tied up, if he's loose), he chases and bites/very roughly paws the cats, he barks NON STOP at the cats, he jumps on the couch and pees on it, he chews on everything - shoes, clothes, furniture, he jumps, he growls and snaps at you if you try to take something away he can't have (resource guarding), he eats his own poop, he bites the kids as they walk by (leaving scratches and bruises on their skin), he digs holes instead of going potty outside (he'd rather go inside!). I could go on. Literally anything you can think of, he probably does. (I expected some breed specific stuff like barking and digging, but not to this extent. I hope I'm communicating how bad it is.)

With all that said, this dog is smart. He knows manners. He KNOWS sit and stay and come and lay down, he knows what it means when we ask him to get down from the couch or jumping, he knows how to walk nicely on a leash, or ""leave it"", or ""go to bed"". He just chooses not to most of the time, and does all of the above behaviors instead.

If you don't watch him and correct him literally the entire time he's awake, he's doing a misbehavior. He chews on the WALLS. On the FLOORS. Even when you remove everything you possibly can, make sure his needs are met (food, water, exercise, etc), he barks and howls and screams like a fucking maniac. (Did I mention he has separation anxiety?)

I don't want to surrender this dog. But I'm starting to hate him.

I cry almost every day because of him. I dread having to take care of him. He does nothing at all that makes me feel joyful or happy, and I feel this immense burden when I wake up in the morning knowing I have to do it all over again. My depression is getting worse. I wanted a buddy, and I don't know why this is so hard.

When I talk to people about it, they laugh and go, ""LOL THAT'S HOW PUPPIES ARE!"" and it makes me want to cry. I've had many puppies in my life, and NONE of them were like this. This is like a puppy on boss mode.

We are doing clicker training at home with tons of treats, puppy behavior classes, an starting private training. But we don't really have the money for private training, which is another issue. The money it's gonna take for him to just behave normally just seems astronomical.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my question. IS this how puppies are? Will he calm down? Is there a point where he can be awake and I don't have to be hyper-vigilant about what he's doing? 

I want to love him. I do love him, somewhere deep down. But I'm exhausted. :("
541,[vent][help] keeping my injured dog safe during holiday chaos,dogs,t3_a69eej,2,False,False,a69eej,"my 12 year old dog hurt his back leg on tuesday. the vet thinks he tore a knee ligament. he has some pain meds and i am to wait for a bit and see if it improves and if not we will do xrays.

he moves around well on 3 legs but i am trying to keep him off his feet as much as possible. it's only been a few days but part of me feels panicked like i should do more. he was very cooperative about laying around not being active the first 2 days but today he wanted to go for a walk and brought me his ball. i thinks it's going to be a long hard road for both of us...

542,[discussion] male dogs 6.2 times more likely to fatally attack than female dogs. Why is this?,dogs,t3_a675bw,11,False,False,a675bw,"I just read this statistic. What’s even more confusing to me is that inact dogs are only 2.6 times more likely to fatally attack than neutered. I’m pretty surprised by the 6.2X discrepancy. One source said it was because males are bigger than females, but there are plenty of big females out there. What could explain this?"
543,[Help] My dog is starting to get afraid of larger dogs,dogs,t3_a694w7,0,False,False,a694w7,"I have an adopted dog since he was 2 and a half months old. He was found when he was just a few days old, so he never had the love of a mother. He was cared by an old lady who found him, then took to a shelter and then we brought it home when we heard about him.
He has always been such a fearful dog, here it’s a video when he got home and backed away from us: https://www.instagram.com/p/BeoDiWnHCR6/ But he did great with another dogs: afraid at first, but he’s so playful and curious, he would forget in a moment and start playing!
He was doing so fine just about one month ago or so (he’s currently one year and 4 months old). When I walk him and he sees a larger dog, he barks at him (he has never barked in his whole life) and he screams and makes a scene (other dog owners usually get scared by his reaction). It usually stops when he smells the butt, but sometimes he doesn’t have the chance because the owners back away from us. He’s on the leash when he does this. He’s always been a drama queen: he stayed on a friend’s house for a few days and he would do that scream sound when he would see the cat and our friend thought the cat did something to him and looked for scratches, only to see later that he would react like this only with his stare.  Well, he’s doing this now every time he meets a new dog (99% larger dogs) when he would never do that before, he’s always been a social dog, he would even cry if he saw a dog and couldn’t go and meet him.
What has changed in this month:
1) We used to go to a little park close to our home for our daily walks, and it’s on construction now and we can’t go there anymore, so we are doing our daily walks on other places and he’s always been more nervous on unusual places (he pulls the leash more, f.e). I noticed this behavior of him when we went to my parents in law house on another city, he would be so afraid of dogs there and would bark for the first time. When we returned home he would be normal, but ever since he’s not in the usual park I think he’s feeling insecure.
2) He’s gone to a canine residence for a week and this is the first time he’s been placed with medium dogs instead of small dogs because he weights now 10 kg (22 pounds) and when he used to go there before he was with the small ones and he was so happy with them, he would return happy. I don’t think he’s been on a fight with one, but he’s so insecure that even a bad stare would give him the chills.

How he reacted before to dogs:
1) Pull of the leash because he wants to meet him.
2) Ears back and respectful.
3) Everything is fine and he wants to play!

How he reacts now:
1) Pull of the leash because he wants to meet the dog, sometimes he barks before (I have to say again that he’s starting to bark now, he NEVER barks, I wouldn’t recognize his bark until now).
2) When the dog looks at him he does the scream sound as if the other dog is killing him and he either:
A) snaps at him with open mouth, but I think it’s a pose because he does nothing. When he does this the owner leaves and interaction finishes. The few times the owner stays, he’s been able to be friendly when the fear passes.
B) Backs away and then he goes again to meet the dog because even if he’s scared to death, his curiosity wins and wants to greet despite the fear.
3) Smell the butt.
4) Sometimes it’s not enough, but usually he relaxes a little more and he begins to play.

I don’t know what to do, walking him now it’s a nightmare. I’ve lost all process in this month, he’s just crazy pulling the leash as well, when we went to our usual park he wouldn’t pull that much and he would react to corrections.  He hasn’t seen his dog friends ever since the park is on construction, he had a handful of them, they were the same age and they would play a lot.

When he’s off the leash he’s less scared and he’s only done this once off the leash. He’s neutered.

I’m sorry for my English!"
544,[Help] Awkward and uncomfortable question about dogs grieving the loss of companions,dogs,t3_a694k4,6,False,False,a694k4,"Sad day.  Today had to put one of our cats down due to cancer.

Our eight year-old Golden Retriever was best buddies with this cat since he was a puppy. The cat would groom the dog, follow him around in the yard and even sleep on him sometimes.

I'll be burying the cat in the garden first thing tomorrow. Some say animals accept their companion has died once they see it, otherwise they may search the house/yard looking for them. 

So despite this being a weird and uncomfortable question: let the dog see the dead cat?  

https://canna-pet.com/dogs-grieve-another-dog-dies/

&gt; Help Your Dog Understand That the Other Dog Has Died

&gt;This may seem a bit macabre, but some veterinarians do recommend that you bring your dog along if you need to euthanize the other. It may help the dog understand that the other has died and is not coming home if he is present during the dog’s passing. If that’s too much, you can let the animal see and smell the other dog’s body after it has died. There is no concrete proof to this, and there may be no obvious reaction in your dog, but it may help your dog understand that the other is not coming back and he doesn’t need to search around when he gets back home.

https://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/pet-behavior-training/can-you-explain-a-pets-death-to-another-pet/

&gt;Cognitive scientists are still wrestling with the concept that animals have self-awareness, let alone awareness of another creature’s mental or physical state. The weight of opinion today is that a “viewing” is not likely to help a pet to understand the death of a companion. While the argument continues, I think we should give our pets the benefit of the doubt and allow them to view a deceased companion, if we feel it might help.

545,[Help] Neighbours dogs won't stop barking between 8 am and 5PM. Need advice.,dogs,t3_a62vyr,26,False,False,a62vyr," For the past 3 months my neighbours their dogs have been barking EVERY morning at 8am when their owners leave for work. They are big dogs so the barks are really loud. I lose an average of 15-20 hours of sleep a week because of these dogs. I work night shifts, so I get home at 6:30 am. The lack of sleep is turning me into a zombie at work, I can't function during the day either and my workout progress has actually been going backwards because of the lack of sleep.

It's literally freezing here, under 0 degres and they leave their dogs outside for 8+ hours. But the dogs don't bark because they're cold, the real reason is that they are raised bad by shitty owners. I've tried evertyhing in my power. Ear pluggs, talked politely with my neighbours, video taped the barking. I actually have 15 different videos, at different days. Video's ranging between 30 seconds and 3 minutes of non stop barking. Some even on the same day with 2 hours intervals.

I went to my neighbours on 2 December. I rung their bell at 11 am on a saturday and they let their 7 year old kid open the door all alone, what the fuck? Bad parenting too apparently. So I ask the kid if their parents are home and he calls his mom and the conversation went like this:

Me; Hey it's koedeloe, I live next door and have been bothered lately. Your dog has been barking non stop as soon as you leave for work at 8 am until you get home. Are you aware of this?

Her: Ohhh, no, this is actually the first time someone has told us that. We haven't noticed since we are at work and don't notice the noise.

Me; Oh I see, well it's annoying, I'm losing sleep since I work night shifts and was wondering how you would fix it?

Her; **I don't know.** (She looked a bit tipsy, her eyes were red. Honestly I was pissed off by this response but didn't show it)

Me: There are a lot of solutions. A dog bark collar, you could leave them inside during the day, get them trained, there is even a device that sends out signals when your dog barks, humans can't hear them but the dog does and associates the barking with the noise and eventually stops.

Her; Oh I see. Well, we'll probably try out the dog bark collar.

Me: Alright, thank you. I love dogs and I know they bark but I would like this to be fixed before 2019 starts.

Her: Definitely. I'm glad you told us instead of calling the police.

Me: We're neighbours, we should stay friends, I don't want to start a war. We're adults and I'm glad we could discuss it so politely with each other. Have a nice weekend!

Her: Thank you, enjoy yours too!

This was 2 weeks ago. She promised me she would have it fixed. But NOTHING has changed. The excessive barking has been going on for the past 2 weeks, since I went over to their house. I've been continuing to video tape it, even called a patrol officer to check out the neighbourhood. Not to file a complaint, but for him to see I'm actually not lying. He said he would, 2 weeks ago, but I haven't heard anything from him since.

I'm actually thinking of going over to their house this evening and talk with them in a less friendly way. Tell them I'm losing patience. Ask them why they haven't fixed the problem, even when I was being politely with them. That it has been 2 weeks and ask if they even bought a dog bark collar. For a fact I know they will lie and say yes. I will ask them to show me the dog bark collar, which they won't because they're lying. After that I will tell them I have video taped everything the past 3 months and have more than 15 videos of their dog non stop barking. That they are bad owners and shouldn't leave their dog outside in the cold for 8+ hours a day while it's freezing.

I know this is not a good idea but I can't think straight. I feel like a fucking zombie and it's the fault of my neighbours. I hope this will wake them up. Probably not but I can try."

I try to keep things out or behind doors but sometimes I forget. She might pull a sock from my closet and I'll find it on the couch. Sometimes it is ripped, sometimes it isn't.  She took a Tupperware lid off the counter and had bite marks on it.

She is excited to see me when I come home, but when I pick up the object her tail drops and she goes to sit by the back door. Obviously very guilty.

Edit: she is about 3 years old and I got her from the shelter about 5 months ago. Very well behaved,  not destructive. Half listens where we can hike off leash."

He's a jack Russel and is 9 years old so I'd like to have some photos of him and myself that I can look back on in the future. I'm aware Jack Russel tend to have quite a few years in them, but I'd like to get some while he's still young-ish haha. I love him to bits and I really don't want it to get to the point where I have no photos and he's no longer active enough for the photos to look nice if you know what I mean. 

There's one issue though. 

My dog doesn't seem to like being still for a photo and it's hard for me to set up a photo where he's having fun and I'm in the same photo... Like he doesn't like being held, which makes things difficult and due to living in a cold, wet country and it being winter, I can't really go to a park and play around with a ball with him.

I really want a photo that both me and the dog are in, having a good time but it's seemingly impossible to get him to stay still for a photo and when I try to hold him like some other cute photos do, he doesn't like it, and I don't want to upset him like that for the sake of a photo.

Anyone else have any experience with this/have any tips to offer?

I have brother and sister Shih tzu/Pug mix. They’re 9 1/2 years old and have been otherwise healthy. My female was recently diagnosed diabetic. I noticed the symptoms and got to the vet. Her blood sugar is high and she has ketones in her urine. Vet says definitely diabetic. 

So we’re starting her on insulin, 1 unit of Novolin-N to start. She’s a feisty little dog, and except for the excess drinking, urination and weight loss she’s otherwise normal. She’s always been a picky eater... sometimes eating like a trucker other times not eating all day. 

I know it’s especially important she eat her two meals a day, 1/2 can of Hill’s W/D, each time per the vet, which is about a cup. If she doesn’t eat she can’t get insulin. She can get 1/2 dose if she eats about half her meal. If she missed one meal her or there she can still get 1/2 dose. But it’s been like herding cats. 

I talk to the vet, but I know she’s not sitting there waiting for me to call with a question. So, my questions:

1. Does anyone else here have a diabetic dog?
2. How do you handle the not eating if it happens?
3. Does insulin boost appetite? Sort of like a bootstrap... gets insulin, gets hungry, eats. "
550,[help] Dog fought with other dog he gets walked with - should I be concerned,dogs,t3_a64h4o,17,False,False,a64h4o,"I work morning shifts 4 days a week so have a walker that takes my dog out at 10am for an hour. He goes out with 2 or 3 other dogs at a time who all walk together regularly so they are a proper little pack and love to romp around. 

I really like the walkers (there are two of them that split the shifts between them). They are competent, knowledgeable, attentive and really love dogs. 

My dog is a 20 month, male Boston Terrier who is very playful but likes to be in charge and I regularly have to correct him during play. The only other male dog who comes on morning walks is a Shiba Inu of the same age and temperament - they don't let him off leash with unknown dogs due to a history of rude behaviour. When they first met they had to monitored carefully because they were quite intense together and definitely trying to establish themselves but it was well managed and went without incident. They've been regularly walking and playing together for 2 months now with no problems. 

Today they were off leash and my dog was chasing a ball. The walker said that the Shiba Inu was going for the ball in my dog's mouth and started to growl. Then my dog went for him and a fight broke out. She said it only lasted seconds but they both really meant it and she got bitten in the process of separating them. She said she ""had them in the naughty corner in front of each other until they calmed down and they were friends again after that and walked along like nothing had happened"". They informed me about it straight away and seemed comfortable and confident in how they handled it and not really that worried about it. 

I just got home and found that my dog has a rather nasty puncture wound at the top of his neck behind his ear. I think it was missed by the walker because he was wearing a rather handsome little winter coat. I've cleaned it up and he seems perfectly fine. 

I'm not sure whether or not I should be concerned or if there is any action I need to take. I know dogs scrap, but is it wise to keep walking two dogs that are clearly ready to fight with each other? How can I work with him to stop this from happening? Is it controllable in that sense? And if not then should I be restricting who I let him play with now that he has demonstrated this kind of behaviour? 

Thanks in advance. "

Probably in order it would go something like:

1. Boxer / Bernese Mountain Dog
2. Newfoundland
3. American / German Shepherd
4. Samoyed - only last as i don't know if i could handle one as a first-timer

&amp;#x200B;

Requirements:

\- Well mannered, easy to train

\- Good around new people/strangers and other dogs

\- Easy to look after, not destructive

\- Doesn't smell too bad

\- Could withstand UK climate (cooler winters)

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* As long as they're affectionate that's the main thing. I know rescue dogs are often but not always like this.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Affectionate, intelligent, well trained, warms to friends quickly, visually nice to look at

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? In no particular order:

* Australian Shepherd - high energy, affectionate, playful, intelligent
* German Shepherd - intelligent, a good guard dog for security
* Boxer - Playful, goofy, close bond, minimal grooming, a good guard dog without looking too aggressive in every day life
* Samoyed - Happy, smiley and look pretty. I would've added a husky or malamute but they're harder to train.
* Bernese Mountain Dog - Happy, friendly, smiley, big friendly giants. Good guard dog without looking too aggressive in every day life
* Newfoundland - Well mannered, always willing to help, good with people

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just be intelligent to understand me

**Care Commitments**

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 3-4 hours at least

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* Willing to do myself 4-5 times a week if needed to.

**Personal Preferences**

9) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Don't want too much shedding ideally. Slobber is ok as long as it isn't going on the floor/walls at home and ideally doesn't smell. Barking is ok but would like it to understand commands to stop when being excessive.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Happy to keep the dog on the leash at times but would like it to have opportunities to run free as well and understand commands to come back.

* Happy to see strangers yet ideally a bit intelligent to understand if there's a small chance of a threat eg would recognise a burglar but more welcoming to a friend coming over. Also intelligent enough to understand a complete stranger such as the postman probably doesn't want a dog repetitively jumping up onto him playfully when he's holding several boxes!

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I'd like it to be either friendly or not bothered by stranger's dogs. Wouldn't want it to be aggressive.

554,[Breeds] Any Guesses on what my dog could be?,dogs,t3_a680e4,8,False,False,a680e4," Embark said I should get my results early January and I cannot contain my excitement. I got Bishop as a small puppy probably 6 to 8 weeks from an ad for free puppies from a accident litter. Bishop is now 7 but I remember all the puppies and his mom. One puppy looked like a Rottie in color and others like blue pits like a intact male they had. Bishop was the same color and coat type as his mom and they only one that looked like him. They had several dogs and I am not sure if the pit was the father to all the puppies because there is a possibility that maybe another male could be because they had other dogs or he just got his mothers genes. He is about 21"" at the shoulder and 85lbs. Would love to hear what you guys think.

556,[HELP] we've been offered an 8 month old Shih Tzu for free as it needs a good home. But we dont know if we can effectively look after it.,dogs,t3_a67nlj,6,False,False,a67nlj,"My girlfriend and I live in a 1 bedroom house with no back garden, but a nice gated in front garden. We've been offered to be given a lovely Shih Tzu boy who's 8 months old and has been neutered already. He needs to be rehomed as he bit the previous owners 2 year old grandson at feeding time as he's very protective over his food.
We've already got a small 11 year old dog that doesn't need much looking after and we love her very much and give her all the exercise and attention and time she needs. 
My partner works in a pub so she's home mornings and early afternoons, and I normally get home at around 2 in the afternoon or on some days it's around 7 in the evening.
Do you guys have any advice, or any points that are worth bringing up? Do you think we would effectively be able to look after this puppy? 

Our dogs have already met and they seem to get on fine, our old girl doesn't seem bothered by him but he seemed very obsessed with her, so I feel like she might put him in his place sooner or later, then I feel like it would be fine? But I am no trainer. The other owner is willing to let us have to Shih Tzu for a week or so as a sort of ""trial"" to see if they get along and what not.

557,"[Help] Am I giving our dog enough stimulation and ""fun""?",dogs,t3_a67len,9,False,False,a67len,"My wife and I are first time puppy parents, and we are loving it. We adopted Quincy - a (now) 6 month old terrier cross rescue puppy about two months ago. He is such a wonderful dog, loving, smart, full of energy, friendly and the only time he really barks now that he's crate trained is to tell us he needs the toilet or greeting another dog. We both took two weeks off work when he arrived, and my wife was able to take a further week on top of that to get him really comfortable at home. He had been fostered with his siblings until four months old, on a farm with a wonderful woman and her dog and cats, so he was really well socialised, friendly with our cat, loves other dogs, and confident.

I take the dog to work with me most days, the odd my wife doesn't work and then she has him at home. While I know that bringing him to work with me is probably better than leaving him at home alone, I worry that he's not stimulated enough! Because of the nature of my work (brewery) he is in a pen rather than roaming around an office. His pen is in the centre of the little brewery, and I'm rarely out of sight. He has a pillow, and a blanket, and toys, and obviously food and water and treats. I'm able to talk to him, and play little wrestling games with him here and there, we do training through the day when I can. There are quite a few people around and so he's often getting attention and pets from them which he loves.

In terms of exercise he gets a quick run around in the park on the walk to work from the train - about 20min total exercise - then I take him out to a different park at lunch time, and there's always plenty of other dogs so he gets to play for 20-30min. Sometimes we go to the park on the way home depending on the weather and how late I finish, so he gets another 20-40 minutes of play/walking. He gets toilet breaks whenever he needs but he usually doesn't need to go outside of these times.

When I first started bringing him to work he didn't like the pen, he's crate trained at home but mostly just for nighttime, and so he cried and barked, and if I left the brewery to go into another room in the building he would bark until I got back. He doesn't do that any more which is a relief, and when we get to work he gets his breakfast and then basically plonks himself down to sleep until lunchtime. I can't even get his attention for a game of tug of war. He does the same after lunch. He is always very excited to go out for our lunchtime walk, and full of energy, but when we're back here it's like he just switches off, and I swear he looks sad in his pen. Writing this all down makes me realise that I'm probably being ridiculous, and on a lazy weekend day he behaves pretty similarly, except he's on the sofa next to us rather than in the pen.

Obviously in the evenings he gets cuddles, and play, and training and all the attention he could want. We rarely leave him alone, and he loves pubs and parties and meeting new people so he's pretty much where we are, though he's quite happy to be left alone for the evening if need be. We try to do lots of socialising and visiting new parks and areas for him to smell new smells on the weekend.

Is he just used to the routine now? Is there anything more I should be doing? Am I projecting? I just want him to be happy and fulfilled!"

562,[Discussion] Itchy Long Haired German Rottweiler,dogs,t3_a64u0l,3,False,False,a64u0l,"Hi everyone!
I have a happy huge furball/bear named Gus, who is a pure German Rottweiler with long long hair. He recently was shaved for a surgery and a lot of his hair has not grown back properly. I can tell this is giving him a lot of discomfort and making him itch a lot as well. I have been bathing him frequently but he hasn’t shown any less itching. I’m trying not to bathe him too much because I don’t want to screw anything up further.

It makes me sad to see him itch so much and whine because he can’t reach itches on his butt. He also has some patches where fur is only growing back to about 1/4 inch instead of his average 2”. 

If anyone has any tips on how to get him a healthy coat and work him back to his sleek silky self, they would be much appreciated.

564,[Help] Anyone Have Experience with Spindle Cells/Fibrosarcoma?,dogs,t3_a64k4z,4,False,False,a64k4z," I'm waiting for my dog Blaze's surgical consult and surgery next week with the surgical specialist and trying to get as much info as possible beforehand. Three and a half months ago, Blaze ( approx. 9 1/2 y/o pitt/shepherd mix, about 72 pounds), had a lump on his left upper back leg (almost up to his hip), about 1/3 of an inch in size. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) came back negative so we just left it be. It has since grown to about an inch in size so a retest FNA has now come back as showing the presence of spindle cells, which my vet informs me is possible for Fibrosarcoma. The lump needs to come out and be biopsied and graded. I'm reading a lot of scary information online but I'd like to hear from people who may have been through this to know what I can actually expect. Anything you can tell me from how your dog did with the surgery, to what happened after with grading and followup treatment, recurrence, etc. Also, costs??? I have no idea what to expect with that. My last dog died from Osteosarcoma 7 years ago, right after Christmas and I just stinks to be going through this again. I want Blaze to have the best chance he can get of surviving this but his quality of life, which right now is still great, must remain good. Thanks. "
565,[Help] Someone is trying to poison my dogs?,dogs,t3_a60zsj,10,False,False,a60zsj,"This afternoon I found two pieces of hot dog with holes in the middle that someone must have thrown over my fence. I've heard of people poisoning dogs this way and unfortunately can't imagine why else somebody would be throwing hot dogs into my yard. I'm assuming (and hoping) neither of my dogs ate any poison since they are both acting normal, but I only found those two pieces of hot dog and don't know if there were more.

I called the vet, who said it was too late to pump the dogs' stomachs but advised me to bring them to an emergency vet if they start showing symptoms of poisoning. I really have no idea what might have been in the hot dogs... rat poison, antifreeze, whatever, and the vet says they're unable to test for that.

I'm not really sure what to do in this situation, since apparently some poisons take up to three days to take effect. Is there something I should be watching for besides the obvious? Ways to rule out certain poisons? Are there foods I could be feeding the dogs that might neutralize the effect of common poisons on the off chance they did ingest something?

Also wondering if anyone knows if this type of thing is usually a one off... or if I should be anticipating more potentially poisoned hot dogs scattered around my yard? I can't tell if I'm supposed to be shrugging this off as a random act of unpleasantness or setting up cameras and gearing up for a legal battle.

It's a weird situation and any advice is greatly appreciated!"
566,[Discussion] Gatekeeping among breeders and rescues,dogs,t3_a5vtun,69,False,False,a5vtun,"I was in the process of responding to a comment in another thread, but decided that this is really something that is a bigger discussion on its own. It's also a very pervasive attitude among breeders and rescues, so I didn't think it fair to respond to the one commenter (or link to the comment - I'm not meaning to single anyone out here).

&gt;No response means you didn't impress them enough to warrant a response. There's a small handful of good breeders and they get hundreds of inquiries a week sometimes, especially around the holidays. You need to stand out and show that you know you're not just looking for a dog, you're looking for a Quality Dog from a Great Breeder.

Since when was ""getting a dog"" something that had to become a job interview? Why on earth should people have to feel like they are on trial because they want a companion animal? Why do rescues and breeders feel like they should be the gatekeepers to the world of pet ownership?

We all (meaning ""dog people"" - as in people in the know. People in this forum) want people to get dogs from reputable sources, or to adopt from rescues. But when those two sources become gatekeepers and put up artificial barriers to dog ownership, they push prospective dog owners to Craigslist or the local Petco or ""farm"" (read: puppy mill with a pretty name). You feel like you're serving the animal community, when in reality you are causing more damage than you can imagine. Not only are you making reputable sources much more expensive for a prospective pet owner, you are also making the whole experience with getting a pet incredibly uncomfortable and exhausting.

I love my dog's breeder, and I wouldn't go to anyone else at all for another dog. And I would gladly jump through all the hoops all over again and wait on her multi-year waitlist to get a puppy from her. But I only know about all this because I've been through ""the program"" before. And that happened quite by accident (decided to go to a dog show to learn about breeds, wound up learning a lot more about breeding). Had I not stumbled upon the world of ""reputable"" breeding because of a one-day family outing, I absolutely would have no clue about ""reputable"" breeding, and I would most definitely have gone to someone advertising dogs, on the cheap, without a long interview process, without numerous contractual stipulations, and with the feeling that my dog is actually mine.

I can't fault people for going to Craigslist, or ""farms"" (read: puppy mills), or wherever else to get a dog, and part of this is because of comments exactly like the one that I quoted above. People who want a dog are going to get a dog. We can lament all we want about how messed up the dog world is because so many unwanted animals wind up in shelters, and how so many people who ""shouldn't"" own dogs do, but by closing our doors to ""the great unworthy ones"" we are effectively perpetuating the cycle - both by pushing those people to less reputable sources, and by taking away access to some resources that would actually help them become better dog owners.

Breeders and rescues alike need to realize that denying a dog to a prospective owner does not mean that a dog is not going to go to a poor home - it only means that another deplorable breeder will get paid instead."
567,[Help] Why does my dog love having her eyes rubbed?,dogs,t3_a60j23,3,False,False,a60j23,"Okay so she does this thing, only at night, where she will paw me until I'll rub her eyes.

568,"[RIP] Jack, Pomeranian, 7",dogs,t3_a61uiv,2,False,False,a61uiv,"Yesterday morning, my dog woke up really early and was just behaving strange. He got off the bed and I could hear his nails pacing on the hardwood. I called him back up to the bed, but something was wrong. He would lay down, and sit back up. He’s had a breathing issue, so I thought maybe he was struggling to breath. He seemed most comfortable on his back, while I scratched his tummy. He looked a little bloated. I already knew I was going to the vet.

Three hours later, he was trying to find cozy places to hide, but he lost the ability to jump. He was in pain. The vet wasn’t open, and the emergency line told me as long as his tongue was pink, he was getting oxygen. I set him in the recliner, and kept myself busy until the vet opened.

I was in the vet before the doors opened. I waited in the lobby until a vet arrived to work. My boy started puking on the exam table. Bloodwork showed some points of concern, nothing major, maybe it was an infection they thought.

They kept him for the day, and I knew instinctually that my boy knew he was gone. They ended up keeping him overnight. I called this morning, and they said his health had rapidly diminished. They saw fluid in his x-rays that wasn’t there the day before. They told me they were going to perform exploratory surgery, because the bloodwork indicated a gallbladder issue.

Ten minutes later, they called me again. The fluid was bile. His gallbladder had ruptured. The damage was unlikely to be undone. They said it could be weeks of hospitalization, and they gave him a “grave prognosis” and a “less than 50/50 shot”. My gut told me to euthanize.

I drove there, he was still on the table, open, under a blanket. Just in case I changed my mind on the drive. They’d already removed his gallbladder. They told me his liver could make it, but yeah, his chances were grim. The vet tech, when the surgeon left the room, told me that I shouldn’t feel bad if I chose to euthanize. She said few dogs make it, but all of them felt pain.

I carried on with my decision to euthanize. They stitched up my boy. They brought him into an exam room. The vet gave him even more anesthesia. I asked her if I was making the right decision. If my boy would ever forgive me. She told me what to expect if I tried to save him. Thousands spent, lots of pain, lots of fear, for a possibility of survival.

I told her I had to let him go. She injected the euthanasia solution, and then some saline, and my boy was gone as I whispered “You’re a good boy” and “You’re still my best friend” through it.

She left and let me grieve with his body. I held him and begged for forgiveness.

His last night at home, it was on my birthday on Tuesday. I was upset. I hate that I’m getting older, and I was feeling sorry for myself. I didn’t pay him much attention all night. Not as much attention as I could have. I of course still laid with him, and told him I loved him like I did every night.

In my frustration with life, I told my friend that I’m so sick of being alone (I lost a relationship over the summer) and that I’d probably just end it when my poor boy died. I did not expect that to be less than two days later.

I do not know how I’m going to get through. He still had half of his life ahead of him, if he was healthy. My poor boy died early. Part of me is happy it was relatively fast. Part of me is terrified that I gave up on him too early. What if he would have wanted to take the pain if it meant more time together? But what if he took the pain and then died? I don’t know.

I have never been so alone. I can’t believe my dog died today. "

So my fiance and I have been talking about getting a dog for a while, and have been walking dogs at the local shelter to scout for potential candidates. After some deliberation, we've found one that we both really like.

[Meet Carol!](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq5FsdKgsPO/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) She's 3 years old, healthy and some sort of tiny dog/large dog mix (the current theory is Belgian Shepherd/Corgi, which, yikes). She's built like a medium-sized dog with tiny legs, and I love it.

So we've had (and passed) the home visit, and the shelter says she's temperamentally suited to our lifestyle.

I guess what I'm asking is: what should we expect when bringing her home? We've both come from doggy homes (my folks have a Jack Russell, his have an Anatolian Shepherd) but I'm interested in common pitfalls for new dog owners. We're also fostering, so if she ends up being a wrong fit for us we can take her back, but I'd like to do right by her the first time if possible.

Thanks!"

I have been keeping her kenneled at night, to give the cats a break, otherwise I am home with her. Also, I have been keeping treats in my hand so when one of my cats is walking by she focuses on me exclusively, which seems to work. Mostly it’s the cats jumping up and down from their cat tower or trying to get affection from me that getting Molly going.


She is not currently spayed, but I already have an appointment to get that taken care of, I made sure of that right away when I was in the process of adopting her.

577,[Help] How Best to Comfort my Dog During Storms,dogs,t3_a619gj,9,False,False,a619gj,"So this is an issue we've always had with our dog. She's a rescue that we adopted and we've had her for a few years. It's generally accepted that dogs don't like storms, but I always feel incredibly bad for her.

Right now it's storming here in Australia (Christ this week has been awful), and she's sitting next to my chair panting really loudly. She refuses to accept treats during storms, and just prefers to sit and pant. And when she does move, her tail is completely drooped.

So far nothing I can seem to do helps, so I just give her a soft scratch on the neck or pat her, and while it seems like she appreciates it, I want to know if there's a better option.

Sorry if I can't give much details. I'll just sum up my question. My dog gets really upset/scarred during storms, is there a way to comfort her?

**Just something to clarify:** There are more storms coming, a cyclone is coming through Queensland and we're experiencing the tail end stuff (Don't worry about us, we're safe. We're down in the Hunter Valley). While I'll certainly be getting a Thunder Jacket when I have the money, it will definitely take a bit to arrive, and if anyone has other solutions I would love to know!"

I just adopted her on November 20th so it’s only been 3-4 weeks of having her. She’s been, in general good but she is not housebroken. At first I wanted to keep her gated in the kitchen so she would have some freedom, but not the whole house. Then she started jumping over the gate and getting into the living room where she made a huge mess (destroyed stuff but not furniture). So I decided to try to kennel her. For half a day it worked, but I came home early. The next day she had escaped her kennel by unlatching the top latch and squeezing through the opening. I didn’t want her to hurt herself so, we tried just gating the kitchen and making the living room extra dog proof. We removed the TV and rug so basically there’s only a sofa and 2 chairs in there. Of course she jumped over the gate every time and I would come home to poop and pee on the floor, which was to be expected. Today, she peed on the sofa which she has not done so far. It was very strange to me because she peed in the spot she usually lays, which I found odd.

I live in an apartment complex and my girlfriend and I recently got new neighbors above us. This morning my girlfriend woke up to VERY loud noises sounding like the boyfriend upstairs was dragging something loud across the floor and she got concerned that it was his girlfriend so she walked outside and that’s when she heard him say “you’re gonna shit in my house right after I take you outside. That’s it your going to the pound!” And he put the poor guy in a crate that they have outside (28°F). 

Last week we hard a bunch of noise coming from up there similar to what she heard today so loud that it woke both of us up (I’m a very heavy sleeper) and heard someone leave. It was the girlfriend taking the dog out after all that noise. Any interaction we’ve had with them has been short but he seems nice. I’ve heard the dog Yelp a couple of times now and it seems to be abnormal how that dog sounds. 

When they first moved in and we did our introductions, he made it a point to say “oh my girlfriend has a dog.” Which I didn’t really think about it but now it seems like he didn’t want the dog and he was kind of the package with her.

The girlfriend wasn’t home this morning when all of this happened so maybe she doesn’t know how bad it is?

Anyways, I live in the Chicago area and didn’t know where to turn. I live in apartments that only allow two animals and I have three (oops) so as shitty as it sounds, I don’t want to get fucked over this but that poor guy has no voice and probably goes through so much more than what my girlfriend saw this morning.

Anywho we have a 7-8 year old female cocker spaniel (kinda disputed which year she was born and yes she was fixed) that about 8 months ago starting having seizures. She has been a healthy dog, a bit on the over weight side but not horribly. She has always been up to date on shots and all the fun stuff. 

The weird part about the seizures is they come and go in monthly cycles. Quite literally. Every 4 weeks or so she will have a series of 3-6 seizures in a span of 2-3 days then they stop for another 4 weeks. Some lasting longer than others. A few days before they happen she becomes very restless at night, that’s when you know the 2-3 day cycle is coming. 

We’ve been to a vet and gave us that seizure guard medicine that hasn’t helped. We have tried a lighter dose of cbd when she has them and it brings her out of them quickly. but are considering higher doses of other brands daily to figure this out

Does anybody have experience with this? It almost seems like this could be a hormone thing being monthly? At this point we are clueless and kind of out of options.

I found them overwhelming, and prefer cats, but there are a few dogs I enjoy. 5 years ago, it got much worse due to an attack I suffered while out for a jog. It was not a minor event, and I was hospitalized. I'm left with a strong fear of most dogs, even though I love animals.

My husband's background: grew up with deerhounds, mutts, and a westie. Adores all dogs and currently volunteers at a shelter, where he walks and plays with them. He'd love to have one. Obviously, I'm the hold up.

So, dog people of reddit, I'm asking for your input. Has anyone been through this with a partner? What steps did you take to acclimate your spouse to having a dog? And if you were at one point afraid of dogs, how did you transition into having one of your own? How did you learn to trust your dog not to hurt you?

Right now, it's up to me, but we're considering trying out a very short term foster situation, so if it's not going to work I can just go to a hotel until the dog is gone. My husband's volunteer gig can help with this.

593,[Help] Sudden aggression over a bone,dogs,t3_a61vpu,4,False,False,a61vpu,"My dog has never shown aggression to me or my dad before. She is far more flight than fight in any situation. She also very much enjoys picking something up and having you chase her around for it as she always gets it back. She likes to play tug with her toys. She is even fine with you putting your fingers in her mouth and taking things out (Found out when a bone got stuck). We have also often picked up her bones and put them aside, she has never been bothered by it, even if that bone is right by her.

&amp;#x200B;

However tonight she got extremely aggressive over a new, meaty bone that she was given yesterday. Growling and snapping at both of us when we came near the bone, though we were not trying to take it. We waited a bit, trying to show her she wasn't going to loose it, she even received some treats and a new toy later on, but each time we where near the bone she would growl. (I pet her in a chair away from the bone and she was happy, near the bone and she growled.)

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand I should not take the bone from her, forcing her to give it up and reinforcing that she is going to lose it because I am a threat to her, but I also don't want her to have it. It's a small living room and if she snaps because I walked by it... well I suppose I don't even have to say I don't want to be bitten.

&amp;#x200B;

What would the best way to deal with this be? Should I wait until she goes to bed (in another room) and put the bone in the freezer for later? Would it be productive to give it to her each night for a short time so she constantly gets a treat? I really have never dealt with this before and I'm at a loss on how to go on.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I was in my room for a bit, returned to the living room where she was curled up on the couch. As soon as I got there she got off the couch and laid by her bone to protect it. She also shows little interest in chewing it, she mainly licks it."
594,[Help] One of my dogs has started attacking my oldest dog,dogs,t3_a603l4,1,False,False,a603l4,"So some back story. My dog Jesse is the second eldest. At our old house she was always very protective of her food and always growled when my youngest dog, Chopper, would come around and pester her. He will literally sit on top of her and vex her while she eats and she'll continue to growl but has NEVER attacked him. Not even nipped or anything. They play fight often and I can tell the difference between real and play. Also to add, Jesse is 6, Chopper is 4, and Dixie is 8. 

Whenever Dixie would walk past her or sniff around, Jesse never growled at her when she got too close to her food. Dixie is fat and she likes to steal the other's food but at the old house they never really cared, besides the humans of course lol. Often times Jesse would eat Chopper's food and growl if anyone got too close which was annoying because it wasn't even her own food and we've made that clear to her. So fast forward we're in our new house for almost two weeks, and yesterday Dixie was literally sitting there, not eating, but sniffing Chopper's food while Jesse is eating and Jesse attacks her. No blood because we managed to get her off quick enough, but this really startles us because it's never happened before.  Today, Jesse is eating and dixie isn't even close to the food, but Jesse attacks and is more aggressive and refuses to let go of dixie's collar. It look a lot of force to get her off, resulting in a little blood, but still very displeasing. I forgot to mention but after yesterday's incident they acted perfectly normal around each other. Anyway, we try to let them outside to see if they're normal again and Jesse initiated other attack but fails because we were observant this time, not that we weren't before but you get what I'm saying lol. My mom thinks maybe it's because of the move, but I'm just not sure. These dogs have known each other their whole lives. Any insight would be helpful. "

596,[Fluff]My dog pushed his head against the door today with saliva dripping out of his mouth while he was pawing at his mouth and teeth.,dogs,t3_a5iwol,78,False,False,a5iwol,"The Mrs went straight to water so I knew that wasn't an option for me, I had to be the calm one. I picked Ben up and put him on my lap and opened his mouth. I saw the problem, he had a small piece of wood wedged horizontally between the back teeth on either side of his mouth in his top jaw. He does love to chew sticks. It took a while to figure out how to keep him still, I ended up putting his front half over one leg and his back half under my other leg to keep his head in place. It took about two minutes (it was wedged in) but I ended up pulling the piece of wood down and slightly back and pulled it out. I didn't want to pull back on the wood because it was so far back but I had no choice in the end. I'm not one to blow my own trumpet but I'm a little proud of how I put my panic aside and calmly figured out what needed to be done. I'm so glad that I've spent so much time putting my hand in Bens mouth when he is on my lap so he got used to having my hand in his mouth without biting down. I was conditioning him not to bite if kids got their hands too close but it worked out in a really good way in a situation I never contemplated until today. "
597,[Discussion][Vent] Finding a “reputable breeder”,dogs,t3_a5p2f3,71,False,False,a5p2f3,"People make it sound like finding a good breeder is as easy as you just google “reputable breeder” and get a list which you pick from. No one forewarned me it would be about as miserable as online dating. Here’s some of my fun interactions on trying to find a breeder.

Multiple dead websites and phone numbers.

Multiple no-responses to e-mails.

NuVet advertisements plastered over every inch of the webpage.

NuVet super subtly hidden in the contracts or website.

Multiple people would ghost e-mails once I asked about health testing, and specifically asked for the OFA numbers so I could see the info myself. I guess they were hoping I would take their word for it.

Being told. “No one really does that for this breed.” (question about health testing.)

Being told. “You have unrealistic expectations for breeders.” (questions about how what they do to prepare a puppy before shipping when I was still considering that, now I refuse to ship after this response.)

Breeder refusing to show a blank copy of the puppy contract unless a nonrefundable $500 deposit is put down first. (I’m guess they probably had NuVet in there somewhere…)

Now Fluff. So I was getting to the point where I was planning on saving up an extra $1500 to just fly across the country on an epic journey if need be to find a breeder who does the health testing and isn’t trying to sell me vitamins. When I just happened to find on the AKC marketplace for my state an ad. But the description was for a different breed. So I googled the place which was about an 1hr 20min away the lady has 30years experience with the breed, her daughter however is breeding the breed I’m looking for! But it gets even better, she’s only advertising out of her mother’s website because she is just starting out. Turns out she lives in the same town as me, like walking distance!

TLDR; Was looking as far as the other side of the country for a reputable breeder who health tests, found one in my backyard."
598,[Discussion] Do you offer to pay family/friends for watching your dog?,dogs,t3_a5uil0,26,False,False,a5uil0,"We're getting our puppy in a few weeks, and I'm already thinking way in advance about puppy sitting. There are a few different instances we'll need our pup to be watched - the main ones I'm thinking about involve us being gone for a couple hours when the puppy is 10 weeks old, and the other we'll be gone for 10 days when the pup is 9 months old.

My sister has already offered to come house sit for the 10 day trip and watch our dog. I fully intend on paying her for staying that long. We planned on asking a friend to stop over when we're gone on the first ""trip"" (from about 6pm--11pm). Should we offer to pay her, or is it ""expected"" that a friend would do this for free? She absolutely loves dogs and has already been talking about visiting and playing with the puppy, so I know she'd be more than happy to do so, but not sure proper etiquette here.

We have absolutely no problem paying for any time spent watching our dog, but didn't know what the norm was. Is there a rule of thumb? If someone watches the dog for more than X hours you pay them, but under X you don't? "

600,[Help] I want to adopt a Vizsla in the future,dogs,t3_a5yzwn,7,False,False,a5yzwn," I grew up with this breed and I am absolutely in love, however... I'm a bit worried about getting another in the future. Not for lack of love, but for lack of space.

Ideally, I'd live in a house with a yard, but as of right now I have no idea if that would be even a remote possibility. Of course, a yard wouldn't be enough-- I'd still take my good velcro friend out for lots of walks/runs/etc. Those long legs need to be zooming!

I'm just worried that if I never end up evolving from an apartment, or even anywhere with a yard is it still ethical to keep a Vizsla? Yes, they're couch potatoes, but that's only part-time. I'd take them out of the city (or town) as much as possible and go on long walks/run all the time (visit dog parks too!) and do as much as possible... but is it still ethical?

There's no way I'd bring this breed into my home unless I knew I could guarantee the proper time and funds, but still."

602,"[Help] Anyone ever experience ""second dog woes""?",dogs,t3_a5vjex,3,False,False,a5vjex,"I feel like an ass for putting how I feel into words but I've been holding it in so long that it's start to fester and I need help or advice or something...

A bit of background info. I adopted a 4 year old American Bulldog who ended up being the perfect dog; well trained, well mannered, and absolutely loved being with his people. He had a fear of other dogs and would get stiff and defensive (not aggressive or anything) when another dog was nearby, but I worked with him through it and I believe that I gained his trust to the max and he became my best buddy. He was my first dog and he was perfect. If I wasn't at work we were always, always together. He'd lay in his bed near my computer, and would sleep in my bed with me at night. He'd greet my brother when he got home but would always lay back in his bed near me. I loved him with everything I had. Of course nothing lasts forever. He had developed cancer, and eventually had to be put down. I was heartbroken.

This past year, my husband and I purchased a puppy from a breeder, a chocolate Lab, at my behest. I tend to prefer bully breeds but my husband doesn't really like how they look, so I figured since I was the one who wanted a dog, I'd get a breed he likes. Compromise right? Anyway I knew training a puppy would be a lot of work but I was so ready to do it. I really wanted a best buddy again. I did all of the training, feeding, all of the getting-up-every-20-minutes-even-at-2-in-the-morning-to-potty, daily walks night and day, taught him every trick/command he knows save for one that my husband taught him, thoroughly researched all his food and treats, and everything else I felt I needed to know and do to raise a healthy and well mannered puppy. My husband doesn't play with him as much as I did/do and literally never walks him unless he's tagging along with me.

He's 10 months old now, and over the past month or so it's become very, very, VERY obvious who his favourite is. It was already kind of apparent before but it's glaringly, painfully obvious now. When pup and I are home alone, he lays down by the door (away from me), behind my husband's recliner (never mine), or way off in the spare bedroom where I can't even see him. When my husband is home, he has to check to see exactly where pup is laying so he can get up without running him over with his computer chair or squishing him with the leg rest on the recliner. Every. Single. Time. because pup is always, always near him. If pup isn't sleeping, he's standing up just staring at my husband with his tail wagging wanting to play with him. I'll bring him outside to play catch and pup will usually ignore me and stare towards the house waiting for my husband to come out. Not always, but more often than not. If we're all outside together and we take turns throwing for him, when it's my turn and I have the toy, he runs around my husband and stares at him waiting for him to throw the toy he doesn't have. I've tried to throw it regardless but he'll look that way, and then back to my husband. I'm not even exaggerating. 

I'm heartbroken all over again. I know he doesn't realize what I do for him but it just makes me feel so... horrible. I resent the pup so much, which makes me feel even more horrible. I already miss my old pup as it is, but this one makes me miss him even more. I cry a lot about it, as pathetic as that is. I hate when he whines to be let out in the morning, it feels like a damn chore lately, when with my old pup I jumped out of bed so we could have our walk together in the wee hours of the morning. I hate remembering that I have to take care of this animal that wouldn't even notice if I were gone. I don't even want to play with him anymore because he doesn't even play when I try. That isn't to say I've stopped taking care of him and stopped trying to play, but I want to so badly. What's the point? I feel horrible for that but I'm just trying to be honest. I just really thought that if I put the work in like I did with my first pup, that I'd have the same experience with my second pup.

I've come to the conclusion that because my husband is lax with his ""training"" (yes I've told my husband that we need to be on the same page when it comes to training but he's a big stubborn softy. Like with my husband it goes like ""you better not do that again"" *pup does it again* ""ah oh well *pet pet pet*), and I'm quite strict and consistent and constant, pup prefers him because he's the fun parent. 

What the heck am I supposed to do? I know I can't force pup to like me, but is there a way I can get him to enjoy my company, even a little? I keep finding myself wishing I had a different dog. I know I can't get my old dog back but I wish so much that I had a different one, or had chosen the breed I wanted. How can I get over these feelings? 

I'm sorry this ended up being way longer than it probably needs to be. I just wanted the information out there so I get some advice. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read through it all."
603,"[Help] My Dog Has ""PTSD"" After Being Attacked, What Did I Do Wrong?",dogs,t3_a5pd4u,57,False,False,a5pd4u,"A month ago my dog was attacked by a 90lb pitbull completely unprovoked (my dog was a 65 lb Blue Heeler). The lady who owned him admitted to using an old collar and it broke free. I was able to save him by choking out the pitbull, got it in an RNC since he was busy biting into my dog. I was extremely tempted to kill it, but a few other people came over to help restrain it and I let go to go find my dog.

My dog needed 4 surgeries over two week and recovered physically, but unfortunately he never recovered emotionally. He was extremely afraid of even the vet. I had to cut all his stitches, remove his drain tube, and his staples myself because he wouldn't let the vet do it.

I thought I could rehabilitate him if I spent a lot of time with him but unfortunately that didn't work. He bit my wife a couple times and eventually bit me several times when I came up behind him while he was smelling my boots.

Sadly he is dead now as he had to be put down. Is there anything I could have saved him? I thought after saving him I was the hero and we'd live happily ever after but no such luck. I really wish I would have killed the pitbull who attacked him as I still see it walking around my apartment complex. Is there anything I could have done to sabe my dog? Why was he so afraid he bit me too?"
604,[HELP] Have you had to make the decision as to whether or not to have a dogs limb amputated?,dogs,t3_a5yl4z,11,False,False,a5yl4z,"I have a neutered male, Flat Coated Retriever mix, 13 years old at the beginning of next month. History wise, he was a rescue and had heartworm (advanced to his lungs), Lyme disease, and Ehrlichiosis when I got him at 1.5 years old. These were treated as quickly as possible after his initial vet visit, though he did have some lasting issues. We've had three incidents with painful swelling in one of his legs on and off and my vet and I agreed to take x-rays and send them to a specialist. The canine oncologist thinks it is probably sarcoma. I have a consult scheduled with the oncologist right after the new year (first available appointment). My initial reaction was that I absolutely did not want to put him through an amputation at his age but from what I have read, a lot of people say it is actually less painful in the long run due to the pain the sarcoma causes. I really want to make the right choice for him, not the less upsetting choice for me. If anyone has had to make this decision for their dog, I would really appreciate hearing their point of view and why they came to the decision they did, and how the recovery went. I will of course be attentively listening to what the oncologist says but since they are not the vet we know and love, I worry they will be more likely to go by the textbook treatment than what may be best for my boy and his quality of life.

Please forgive any typos/grammatical errors. I just found out today and am a little upset.

TL;DR: My big old dog probably has soft tissue sarcoma on his elbow. Amputation is the usual treatment. I am torn between treatment and making him as comfortable as possible without surgery.

Edit: Realized I forgot to mention he previously had a mast cell tumor and has other lumps the vet checks regularly."

609,[Help] Dog got bit by another dog. What do I do about the vet bill?,dogs,t3_a607r7,5,False,False,a607r7,"Hello all, thanks in advance for the help. My house is the third house in a series that share a back parking-type dirt lot. The dog in question lives two houses down, and their owners park up by their house, in a spot thats tucked away between their house and the house thats next to mine. The setup is kinda important I think.

My roommate and I were playing with my dog, off leash, in the section of the lot right behind my house. Running around, jumping, all that good stuff. I turn my back to head in, call Hank to follow, and then out of the corner of my eye see this dog booking it over from the other house. Super speedy. I dunno if they immediately starting fighting or if I just reacted really slowly but all of a sudden they're fighting. I grab my dog (who probably has 15-20 lbs on this dog) and the other dog, unfazed, starts trotting up back to his house, and which point his owners make an appearance and scold him, but don't say anything to me. Whatever, dogs are dogs, all seemed good so we go inside. I then notice a lot of blood around my dogs eye.

Cue the vet. Superficial wounds, didn't get his eyeball (although his cuts are amazingly close). They test to make sure his cornea isn't scratched, clean the wound, give me antibiotics and an anti inflammatory and a cone and I'm checking out. $250. At think point I'm thinking maybe I should have just wiped his eye at home--I've had Hank for almost 2 mo and I am pretty financially stable, but this is the 3rd $200+ vet bill since I got him.

My plan was to ask my neighbor to split the bill because 1) I honestly don't know who started the fight. Neither does my roommate. Hank has done well with the 3 other dogs I've introduced him too, but what if this one startled him and he acted aggressively first? and 2) we both had our dogs unleashed on a shared plot of land. But his dog did charge at mine and did bite, so I feel justified in asking them half.

My boyfriend thinks that this plan leaves room for doubt in their mind that they should be responsible. They could easily say: If you don't know who started it why do I have to pay? And maybe I didn't see who started it, but they definitely didn't, as another house was blocking their view and they didn't make their way down to the driveway until after the dogs were separated (and again said nothing to me). So I guess in theory I could easily say their dog started it and ask for the full $250. But at the same time I feel kinda bad because it really was just some superficial cuts around his eye--maybe I could have just saved myself the trip and the money and this whole thing could just be over.

I have a copy of the itemized bill ready, but would appreciate advice on how you guys think I should proceed."

He hasn’t wanted to drink any water or eat any kibble yet, I’m not too sure if that’s normal because of the medicine they gave him at the vet? He did eat a bit of hot dog when I gave him his antibiotic at home. Are there any tips you can give me to make him the most comfortable?

Looking at the treatment plan they are setting out for her I feel really overwhelmed. It's looking like it's going to cost me upwards of a $1,000 a month to keep her ""healthy"" and that's not including annual shots, flea and tick, food, toys, heartguard etc. 

Based on her age and breed she's got a life expectancy (Other medical problems aside) of about 12 more years, which means I'm going to have to spend 144,000 on her for just her possible epilepsy.  This is also not including an MRI and other testing they want to do on her.

We don't spend a lot of time outside due to the cold (maybe an hour total) and it's rarely windy here.

622,"[Help] Adopting a dog and driving across the US with it. (Please lend advice, stories, tips!)",dogs,t3_a5yf8m,10,False,False,a5yf8m,"Hello! I moved to Ohio after 2 years living in the deep south, and have been back for about 5 months.  I had been looking for the right dog for a while, not ready to commit to any dog I found because it had to be just right for my princess of a cat.  About a month and a half ago, a friend from down south asked me if I would be willing to adopt her rescue dog, as I had shown an affinity for him when they first got him, and expressed interest in helping out.  (He is being rehomed because they have a toddler, 3 dogs, and a cat, and all 3 dogs have some allergy problems.  I'll also say here, I grew up with dogs with allergy problems, so this is not a big deal!)

I knew after I had been looking for so long and had been so patient that it was PROBABLY so the universe/karma monster/whatever could link this darling boy up with me.

ANYWAYS, my fiance and I will have to drive with him 15 hours once we pick him up.  He takes daily benedryl already (allergy issues) and is a fairly good car rider, but does anyone have any tips for things we should get to make his ride more comfortable?  He will have constant access to water, and a smoked cow femur bone, a blanket from his other house, and a soft toy.  How often should we stop to offer him to go outside?  He is house trained but I am unsure that he will know how to signal in this setting.  Should we feed him during this ride, should they be normal sized meals?

I will also note, I have a sport utility vehicle (so think like a small SUV) and he will have the whole unobstructed back seat to himself.

Thanks in advance!"

624,[HELP] Blood in dog's drool.,dogs,t3_a5y9xh,2,False,False,a5y9xh,"For background, she is a five year old puggle, around 28-30lbs. She's had an upset stomach for a few days (no vomitting or extra loose stool) and been a bit drooly, and stinky breathed, but I originally attributed it to her eating her poop quite a bit this past week (a behaviour we've been battling since we got her). Now I'm not so sure. 

I put my hand down to pet her and felt she'd drooled on herself so I got a paper towel to clean up. That's when I noticed there was actually blood in it. Not a huge amount, but enough to discolor her fur and the paper towel. I grabbed another one and wiped it around all of her teeth - no blood. I was suprised to find she let me go in her mouth with just my hands. She never allows it. But this time, as I was holding her lip up prodding around, she actually fell asleep. So, I guess she's a bit sluggish as well. 

The vet is the obvious solution, but until then, do any of you have experience with this or an idea on what could be up?"

I have always been told that Labradors are food-happy dogs, and my dog is no exception. But sticking to our vet's advice we have managed to keep him at a healthy weight all his life.

Now in the last years of his life, I expected to see his appetite decrease with time. This is not the case however. On the contrary, my dog is more hungry than ever.
He is always nudging everyone in the house to let him outside. Thinking he does this to go pee, we let him outside, only for him to stand waiting where we usually throw out his food for him.
If you don't, he will start whining for a few minutes, before giving up. Repeat cycle.

We have never fed him on his own accord, outside of mealtimes, so I don't understand why he would suddenly start to try demanding food.

627,[Help] What to do about aggressive dog at dog park?,dogs,t3_a5vc0o,8,False,False,a5vc0o,"We have a 5 month old mini goldendoodle  pup who we bring to the small dog park every other day for socialization and play time. We're still working on recall and he's still developing his manners, but he is consistently friendly and never aggressive with other dogs. At worst, he doesn't yet understand when to back off from someone who doesn't like him and just wants to be everyone's friend. 

A good number of dogs frequent the dog park. Most are friendly and social, but there's one dog that has repeatedly attacked our pup and other pups. The owner has jokingly said that his dog ""is kind of an asshole."" If only I appreciated what he meant when he first told me that... It's a stout little Jack Russel who will latch onto a younger dog's neck and not let go even after the dog starts yelping and screaming and crying. His owner thinks he's just playing and does nothing more than say ""no"" with very little emphasis. It's not play; it's an aggressive attack. Even after attacking 3 dogs in one day, he did not remove his dog from the park. The dog has attacked (multiple times) my pup, a husky pup of the same age, and a tiny pup a bit older than my pup but half his size. I watch my pup closely and am sure he has not done anything unreasonable to provoke the attack. But every time they are in the park together, our pup gets attacked.

Now I take my pup out of the park every time this guy and his dog show up, but it seems unfair that we should have to leave because someone else's dog is aggressive. The rules of the park clearly say no aggressive dogs. Is this something to get the police involved with? I'm just not sure how to best handle the situation and would appreciate any input. 


TLDR; a dog repeatedly attacks my nonaggressive dog as well as other dogs. What should I do?

633,[fluff] should I teach my dog to chew on toys?,dogs,t3_a5wuzc,4,False,False,a5wuzc,"I just adopted a dog from the shelter. We've only had her a week but she has come out of her shell a lot already. The first two days we had to carry her like a rag doll wherever she needed to go and now she'll sniff about and randomly switch between being with me downstairs and my husband upstairs. So it's totally possible that adjusting to toys will just take some more time for her.    She's a three year old small Pointer and she's mainly interested in people. She prances around playfully and chases and sniffs toys, but she won't bite them. Even when I put peanut butter in her Kong she won't bite it, she'll push it up against her crate wall and only lick. She enjoys playfully following me around and mainly just wants to cuddle, but I'm worried she doesn't know it's okay to play with her toys. The only thing she's bitten so far was a pillow, and she only destroyed it because she got anxious in her crate, but she did have a variety of toys in her crate at the time that she could have chewed on. Should I teach her to chew on toys or should I just be grateful I don't have to worry about my dog chewing up anything?"
634,"[Help] We have a kitten now, and not sure about licking behavior?",dogs,t3_a5wppu,7,False,False,a5wppu,"So the kitten came to us yesterday. She's currently quarantined to my bathroom and I just want some input on my dogs behavior to make sure this isn't going to be a bad thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

History on both:

Kitten is a stray but spent a few nights with my landlords pitbulls prior to me taking her in. She isn't phased by dogs at all. She has yet to actively approach my dog but she doesn't run from her either. She is more focused on getting love from me. I think as long as I get some cat trees/give her a safe space she'll be content. 

Doggo is a Collie mix whose pretty much exclusively dealt with strays. We've run into about 7 cats. She is interested in them, gets a bit excited, but it's not hostile. She still listens to my commands without issues. She doesn't attempt to pick them up but she does lick them. She has attempted a chase before but was able to be recalled successfully. She backs off if they hiss at her.

&amp;#x200B;

The main thing I'm worried about is the licking. She does it with puppies so I don't think its a hostile behavior but I've never really seen a dog lick a cat before. Is this a behavior I should not allow as much as possible or is it fine? (They have not interacted directly yet so I have no idea how the kitten feels about this behavior). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on the excitement part by rewarding when she's calm around the door the kitten is behind/in the apartment in general just to reinforce everything before the kitten moves into a bigger room. Any other pro-tips? "

We're trying to adopt now because I'm a full time college student, so I'll be around pretty much 24/7 for a little over a month to help the dog acclimate to its new home, as well as doing some training and some fun bonding activities if they're up to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I go back to school, the dog really won't be left home alone all that much anyway, but we think it'd be better if someone was constantly around while the dog is still trying to catch their bearings in case they get scared or something. What kind of things should I be doing to allow for the best possible transition? Keep in mind I'm only going to be home a month or so until the summer, so I don't want the dog to get so attached to me to the point that they get scared or upset when I have to leave to go back to school. Also, we're willing to spend money on whatever will help the dog feel comfortable beyond the basic puppy things. And we'll be taking it to our vet within a week or two, so she can prescribe anxiety meds if necessary.

We really want to get an adult dog, so between the ages of like 2 and 5 would be ideal, if thats any help at all. Also, we have had one dog before, so we know what the care is like, but we got him when I was super young so I don't know much about helping a dog adjust to its new home?

I just moved into a new place with my 5 year old Eskie with a roommate who has a 6-month old chihuahua. At our old place when we lived alone, she would never relieve herself inside the house at all. Since moving into this new place with a new roommate and other dog, there's been several instances where she's peed inside the house now, even after I've let her out an hour before.

My roommate's dog isn't potty-trained and he does piss and shit inside the house, usually on a rag. I don't know if my dog is picking up that behavior as being okay to potty inside the house or not but that looks to be a strong reason (I also don't know how to properly eloquate that to my roommate but that's another story).

645,[Discussion] Should I get a pet insurance plan for my young dog who's already had a few health problems?,dogs,t3_a5uito,4,False,False,a5uito,"This is a question mostly geared toward folks who have pet insurance and have experience with submitting claims.

&amp;#x200B;

My young, active Border Collie is 19 months old now. I had been debating getting pet insurance for him when he was a younger puppy, but at 11 months of age he was hit by a car, resulting in soft tissue injury lameness in one hind limb, which resolved uneventfully with medical management. Shortly after that, he had a small draining tract in his paw pad, suspected due to a penetrating foreign body. This resolved after several months of medical management and finally minor surgery for debridement. Shortly after that, he came back from boarding with kennel cough, which resolved after a course of antibiotics.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still thinking of signing him up for a plan because he's extremely active and more prone to injury due to him being a sports dog (agility). He's getting older so I want to make a decision soon before the premium rises much more, and I'm kicking myself for not having enrolled him in a plan when he was much younger. Considering he's already had a few health issues, I wonder how likely it is that future claims will be rejected due to these being considered pre-existing conditions. The draining tract shouldn't cause any secondary issues down the line, but I can see how any future lameness might be connected back to the car accident by an overly-cautious insurance company. This is especially pertinent to me considering he's most likely to suffer from musculoskeletal injury due to his active lifestyle. I also fear that the company might reject claims for any type of respiratory disease due to his history of kennel cough.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I still go for pet insurance? What do you guys think? Any thoughts would be appreciated."
646,[Breeds] What dog (if any) is right for me?,dogs,t3_a5qn88,28,False,False,a5qn88,"Hello all, thanks for taking the time to read this. Long story short, I've never owned a dog and recently I've been thinking about getting one. I have no idea what kind of dog would be right for me, if any (I can definitely accept if I'd be better off waiting until my living situation changes a little to be more conducive to dog ownership).


1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, this would be my first dog. 

* I'm completely ignorant when it comes to things like dog breeds, care, etc (was allergic to furry animals as a kid, have since grown out of it; have never had a pet)

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference really, but are rescue dogs better for more experienced owners? I want to make sure that I can properly care for any dog I get, so dogs that require more knowledge probably aren't for me.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Probably one that is low maintenance and easy for a new owner. Minimal shedding and short hair would definitely be nice. It also needs to be relatively quiet because I live in a condo, and on that note it also needs to be a dog that can be happy living inside a condo in the city. While I really like the idea of having a dog, I also really like not doing yard work so I'm hoping I can find a dog that doesn't need a yard (even if I move to a bigger place, I don't see myself wanting a yard).

* I don't want it to be super clingy because I do work full time and I don't want it to get depressed every time I leave, but I would like a dog that wants to hang out and chill with me when I'm home.

* I'd like the dog to be relatively smart/easy to train, and hopefully with a calm demeanor. Definitely not something that's going to be super aggressive, this isn't intended to be a guard dog or anything and I'd like it to be friendly around other people/animals when we go out.

* In terms of size, I can't imagine any large dog will be happy inside my place, but I'm hoping a medium sized dog might have enough room (for reference, ~900 sq ft, 2br; I live alone so the dog could have its own room but I wouldn't mind if it slept in my room either).


4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I really know nothing about breeds. I did some cursory googling and filled out a couple dog breed questionnaires, but I have no idea if their recommendations were hilariously bad or not. Out of the ones that I saw, these were a few I wrote down:

* Pharaoh hound, whippet, Peruvian Inca Orchid (is this really the name of the breed?), curly coated retriever (do these really not shed that much?), shiba inu, cirneco dell etna, xoloitzcuintli, silken windhound (these look really cool, again wondering if they shed much)

* I have no idea if these are odd or highly specialized breeds, they were just what popped up on a few recommendation websites. I think I saw the whippet pop up a few different times.

* I'm not a huge fan of pugs or bulldogs or dogs with that type of face.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I'm not really expecting that I'll train it to do a lot of tricks or anything. I'd just like to train it more to be well behaved and calm so that I can take it out for walks and not have it be stressed or freak out.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Not sure what kind of time commitment is required with training a new dog, would be curious for input on that. For interacting, I'd be hanging out with it from when I get home until I go to bed, so most days ~3-4+ hours, maybe?

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Normally when I get home each day I go for a 1-2 hour walk as long as it's not raining or super cold (both of which are fairly rare, I'm in L.A.), so I'd take the dog with me on that. On weekends I typically walk a bit more, but usually broken up between then morning and afternoon. By the way, for exercise do dogs like walking around for extended periods? Is it better for them to be running around at full speed, or maybe at least at a healthy trot?

* As far as dog parks go, that probably wouldn't be a weeknight thing, but I could see it on the weekends potentially.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'd prefer not to do a ton of brushing. Home grooming I'm not going to do until I reach a point where I feel like I know what I'm doing. Yes, I'll pay to get it done as much as needed; if certain breeds need it less often, that's definitely a plus.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Nothing big, but I'd also prefer not to go super small.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Minimal barking due to condo living. Would prefer less on the shedding and slobber fronts as well, to whatever degree possible.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would definitely be nice. Mostly I just want to be sure that it isn't going to go charging off after a squirrel it smelled from 3 blocks away at the drop of a hat.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Are there dogs that want to hang out when you're around, but are happy being alone too? If so, that. But since I work and live alone, I want a dog that's a little more independent.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please, at least insofar as obeying commands and not giving me a hard time.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I want my dog to be friendly around other people. Tail wagging, minimal barking or begging.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, that's beyond my comfort level.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Nothing I can think of. Not really a behavior, but I'd like to avoid breeds that typically have serious health issues. I want a happy and healthy dog.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Daily during the work day.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* None.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Nope.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA, not that I know of.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Los Angeles, so need a dog that'll be happy in desert-y weather. Summer will get into the 80s or 90s. Winter can drop as low as the 40s at night, but usually more like the 60s or 50s. Dog would remain in the house most of the time, so temperature should be pretty comfortable.

**Additional Information and Questions**

Thanks for taking the time to read all of that. Please do let me know what factors I might not be considering. 

While I'd like a dog, I'm not in a huge rush to get a dog; I want to take my time doing research before I make any decision. I also want to make sure that owning a dog is something I can fit into my life. 

**TLDR:** I live alone, work full time, and have not owned a dog before. I am wondering if there are dogs out there that are relatively low maintenance, friendly, and not prone to getting depressed/lonely if left alone during the day. I live in a smallish 2br condo and would prefer a dog that is medium, IF my place is big enough that one could be happy living in it."

655,[Help] How do you creatively hide treats for a tiny dog?,dogs,t3_a5pwrr,5,False,False,a5pwrr,"My senior PomChi is super tiny, has little teeth left, doesn't see super well, has probably been totally deaf her whole life. Therefore, most dog sized toys, chew toys, anything that is thrown (literally the only time she barks or gets frightened is when something like a sock goes airborne), and squeaky toys.... all total duds in my house.  
She does like 2 things - chasing my feet around, and nosing around for treats. 

But, the nosing thing... only if its super easy to smell the treats are there and she's familiar with the item the treat is under. Since I'm going for Dog Mom Of The Year here... the items I use are empty Copa wine cups and lids. I have 3 of each and I set tiny treat bits under the lids (sometimes i set one of my lighter shoes on top so she can tell the lid is there and lid means treat but its harder for her to get) and then i put the cup upright with the treat inside so she has to bop it around a bit more to get the treat out.

656,"[Discussion] Do dogs have a ""language"" they understand? Or are they simply understanding the emotion behind the other dogs' bark?",dogs,t3_a5oehn,10,False,False,a5oehn,"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but when two dogs cross paths on the street and start barking at each other, do they actually understand what the other is saying?

For example, one dog walks into another dog's territory, the dog who the territory belongs to blocks the other dog, shows their teeth and starts barking at the 'intruder' dog.

For the dog who is intruding, does he/she understand the other dog is telling them to back off? Or do they know to back off only because they understands the aggression and emotion in the other dog's bark?

If I were to go to Spain and break into someone's house and they came out of their bedroom yelling at me in Spanish I would have no idea what they are saying, but because their face looks angry and they are shooing me away and screaming at me I know they're obviously telling me to get out."

I currently work from home but that's likely to change soon so I'm looking into daycare for my 1.5 year old spaniel/pointer mix. While she does fine when left alone, I figure she'll be much happier playing with friends versus sitting alone at home all day save a 30min walk (and the price difference is surprisingly small).

There's a well known company in my city that has a location just a few blocks from my apartment. I'd heard good things from dog park friends and the reviews are great on Yelp. However, in the member handbook they say they use a ""pack leader approach inspired by Cesar Milan"" ... this includes making a dog ""submit"" by laying on its side with a person standing over them or with a hand holding them down until the dog returns to a ""submissive state of mind.""

I'm a relatively new dog owner but from everything I've read Cesar Milan's methods are widely viewed as outdated and even dangerous with the wrong dog. I was really surprised to see a respected dog daycare/boarding facility subscribes to these views. Should I keep looking, or am I overreacting? My dog can be timid and I worry that these techniques could make her more fearful.

665,"[Discussion]Those with reputably bred dogs, please share your positive experiences!",dogs,t3_a5lcpw,46,False,False,a5lcpw,"Dog owners on this sub are excellent about suggesting and urging those looking for puppies to go the Reputable Breeder (RB) route. Adoption is wonderful too, but this post is specific to RBs.

Things like ""These dogs are appropriately health tested"", ""They have generations of healthy dogs in their pedigree"" and ""They are far less likely to have temperamental or behavioural issues"" are reiterated in threads over and over. But often times it doesn't go further than that. It may be difficult for some to trust this information if they, firstly, have never heard of a RB or the difference between them and BYBs, and secondly, because people rarely share their own positive outcomes in detail. 

So my inquiry is, can those of you in this sub who have owned dogs (whether for many years, or just recently) and went the RB route, share the positive experiences you've had with your dogs? Both physical and behavioural.

I think many people would appreciate the ""evidence"" or ""proof"" that it indeed does make a difference in the dogs they bring home, instead of just hearing that these breeders produce great dogs. Hearing the facts is one thing, but reading about those who have lived the experience may help to tip them over the fence.

A (somewhat horrible) illustration to describe my point: 

Let's say someone is looking to buy a home. There are two homes next to each other that look relatively the same, but you have a knowledgeable friend with you to help decide which one to choose. The left house, though it looks great and has its pros (lower price, maybe some unique qualities, is ready to move into) was advised against by your experienced friend. The right house, is also beautiful, but you yourself may not be able to tell by looking at it, that it is better quality. It also may take a while longer to move into because it is not yet finished. Your friend describes to you why it is worth the extra money and wait, and what issues you will avoid down the line, that you would inevitably face with the other home. That friend then also shows you around their own home, which was built by the same contractor, giving you proof that their handy-work is trustworthy. You were a bit skeptical, but you were able to see the true difference which helped you make a wiser decision.

So for example, someone with a ""certain breed"" from a RB, what issues are common in the breed, and have you experienced those issues?

Maybe those of you who have had two of the same breed, one from a BYB and one from a RB, what differences did you see?

Please share your results from going with a Reputable Breeder and your personal experience with the differences you've seen between RB's and BYB's.

Thanks! I look forward to seeing your comments!"

669,[Help] Breeder has gone AWOL on me,dogs,t3_a5ma4r,13,False,False,a5ma4r,"So I’ve been in contact with a breeder for months now. We’ve communicated primarily via email and have not met in person. Normally this would be a red flag yes, but I was referred to her by another well respected breeder so she probably trusted me a bit more than a random person. 

Anyway, since about May, I’ve been under the impression I would be getting a puppy around this Christmas (I filled out an application, she confirmed I was on her list via email). I’ve been periodically emailing for updates. Anyway, in October I sent another email requesting an update since the puppies should have been born (or would be very soon). No response. I follow up email two weeks later, still no response. I’m getting worried now. So I call and leave a message, and she texts me saying she’ll call me that evening. She didn’t. I text her again a few days later. She says she’ll call now that day. She didn’t. I text again. Nothing. I call again and leave a voicemail. Nothing. 

Keeping in mind my pup is coming up on 8 weeks (if I even have the birthdate right!), I’m extremely worried that this has been a scam. No money has exchanged hands yet, however, so I don’t understand what the reason for toying with me like this is. I spent months finding a good breeder (she is well known in the local breed club and I’ve looked up the health records of her dogs, all excellent and with titles).  

I’ve tried to be patient. I understand she is older and very busy with puppies and life, but this is getting ridiculous. I don’t even know the puppy take home date, let alone when I will actually get to pick my puppy or even see pictures! Has anyone had experience with something like this? Is it normal for a breeder to just get busy and fall behind? It was my understanding that it is normal to get things like photo updates and pay a deposit in advance. She’s been slow to respond since the beginning and hasn’t given me many details. She never cooperated in setting up a date for me to visit her and her dogs. I feel like an idiot for even getting my hopes up, but she is clearly a very reputable breeder, so I didn’t expect this complete lack of professionalism. 

At this point even just telling me I’m not getting a puppy would be appreciated. I’m resisting the urge to just call her nonstop or stalk her on Facebook (though I will message her there if I still don’t hear back soon). I don’t want her to think I’m being crazy demanding, but I feel like I am going crazy. This is so frustrating because I’ll need to start all over finding a breeder and I’ve been looking forward to finally getting a puppy after over a year of searching and waiting. :(

The breed I’m referring to is Bernese Mountain Dog if anyone is curious. What did I do wrong? Should I give up and start the long process of reaching out to breeders? Anyone know of good Berner breeders in the Midwest? This is such a disappointment because there aren’t many around me and many don’t even respond to me in the first place. Sorry to rant, but I guess I just needed to."

674,[Discussion] I was in a car accident a few weeks ago and my dog wasn't restrained.,dogs,t3_a5jru4,18,False,False,a5jru4,"I was driving home at night with my two year old Aussie, Jamie.  He was riding up front like he normally does on the drive home as it wasn't any crazy distance. 

 I went around a corner , blinked, and them BAM!  The hood of my car was up and I couldn't see where I was going.  I luckily know the road well enough that I was able to pull to the side.  I got out to see if what I saw was actually what I hit.  About ten feet back in the middle of the road was a huge buck.

I got Jamie out of the car and we waited for help.  Some nice people did come and pull the deer out of the road.  It was dead on impact.  All I could think about was how lucky I got that neither Jamie or I were injured in any way.

Now I have my new car already and Jamie is riding in a crate no matter how small the distance.  I live in the mountains and the roads can be very curvy.  My main problem has been he slides around in the crate even with a blanket laid down (he just bunches it up in a corner) and he'll just start screaming like he's in pain out of no where.  I think it's scaring him when he starts sliding.  The crate is staying firmly in place though.

Right now the crate I have in the car is just a wire one.  I'd like to upgrade to something that can take an impact better than wire or plastic.  Any crate recommendations for the car would be stellar.  In the mean time is there anything I can buy to help him keep traction?

678,"[HELP] I euthanized my first dog (12.5 GSP/lab mix) this weekend and feeling tremendous grief, denial, and guilt. Any stories or words of support appreciated.",dogs,t3_a5lj8u,8,False,False,a5lj8u,"**TLDR**: I'm struggling with feelings of guilt after I euthanized my 12.5 year old german shorthaired pointer / lab mix, Lucy, on Sunday after a hemorrhaging episode and discovery of a splenic tumor. I feel guilty as though maybe we misdiagnosed her problem, or maybe she would have had a lot more time with me if I would have just given her a chance to recover fully from the hemorrhaging. Any shared stories or words of support would be much appreciated. 

**Details**: Prior to Thursday, Lucy was having some health issues including lots of lumps, difficulty hearing, and back/hip pain that limited her mobility. She loved my attention and food, and usually tolerated walks, but couldn't run at the beach, play fetch, jump on the bed, or cuddle with me like she used to. She struggled and hesitated to walk up into the car when we drove places. I'd been thinking for several months that her time would be ""soon"", but that it wasn't up yet.

On Thursday night she started whining, panting, and then suddenly started peeing red-blood uncontrollably every minute or so. (She had also thrown up that morning and was reluctant to get up for walks all day so I think the episode had already been going on for a day before the blood pee.) I brought her to the emergency veterinarian, hoping that it was just a UTI or kidney stone, but the veterinarian looked very concerned. Lucy was also spot bleeding on her gums, the veterinarian suspected that she wasn't clotting blood, and the bloodwork confirmed that she didn't have any platelets. She gave Lucy some IV liquids, steroids and Vitamin K to help with clotting, and prescribed an antibiotic and steroid regimen. An informal ultrasound exam revealed the presence of a tumor in her abdomen area and the veterinarian recommended some imaging so I did an x-ray and opted to take Lucy home rather than pay for in-patient care.

On Friday morning I spoke to another veterinarian who said the x-ray revealed a splenic tumor that may have been causing the hemorrhaging, and in any event would be likely to hemmorhage even if Lucy recovered. If it had already hemmorhaged, then the next hemmorhage would likely imminently in the next week or so. Surgery for these types of tumors have a poor prognosis because of her blooding clotting issue, and even if successful life expectancy is only about 3 months after surgery. Even though there were options like that surgery and further testing like biopsies to understand the condition better (e.g. whether it would spread, or just sit there and rupture eventually without spreading) I had a strong feeling that euthanasia was the right decision, asked the veterinarian if that was reasonable, and she gave me the names of a couple of people who could come to my house to do it. With many tears I scheduled an appointment for Sunday, strongly preferring Lucy to die peacefully in my arms at home instead of scared in an emergency room if her condition worsened or returned. 

She seemed very lethargic and ""ready to go"" over the weekend. By Sunday morning, her urine returned to a normalish yellow color and she had a little more energy. I panicked about the impending euthanasia appointment, called the hospital again, and consulted with another veterinarian who agreed that she had a very poor prognosis. 

I went through with the euthanasia and she died in my arms licking peanut butter on her dog bed in the living room. The death itself was as calm and peaceful as it could be.

I was strongly bonded to her and feel empty now. The last day my grief has been expressing itself as guilt about the decision, and denial about her condition. I'm fixated on the ""uncertainty"" of everything -- maybe she was making a recovery and would have had another year of life. Maybe she just had an infection and we misdiagnosed everything. Or she ate a foreign object that caused the bleeding and would have passed. I've been going down WebMD rabbit holes looking for more treatable conditions that match up with her symptoms, and wondering if we just didn't do the right tests, or if I should have done the biopsy and we would have discovered that it wasn't a tumor at all but someone just misread the image or something. 

I feel like this is all just an expression of guilt and denial -- ""she wasn't mortally sick, it was just something that could have been cured and we could have gone on like normal if we had just done it right!"" And it is also part of the gravity of the moral responsibility that I bore when I, alone (I was the sole owner), made the decision that euthanasia was in her best interest. I was not prepared at all for how weighty that moral responsibility would be without a crystal ball. 

Has anyone gone through similar feelings? Can someone tell me that I am just being crazy and grieving? I hate that I am fixating on all of these what-ifs.

He is super lazy and depressed. He hardly leaves his room. He got this dog right before we moved into together, it seems to me that he got her as an emotional support animal in a sense. It’s a golden doodle so it has a ton of energy and needs a lot of attention. But unfortunately my roommate completely neglects her. We live in a small apartment so there’s not much room or yard for her to run. Aside from taking her to the alley way to go potty twice a day, I only see him take her for a walk maybe once a week. I’ve only heard of him taking her to a dog park twice in 10 months. He just locks her in her kennel for most of the day (sometimes for 12+ hours). And if she’s out of the kennel he locks her in his room. Because of the neglect she is very poorly behaved. I’m super busy and tied up in my own life that I unfortunately don’t have time to take care of her, but occasionally I’ll take her out but it’s a nightmare because she has no social manners and jumps on people, barks and tries to run away. On top of everything, he always jokes about her (the dog) being depressed and that they can be depressed together. Is it just me or is that kind of sick?

As my gf was getting into the elevator our dog jumped at somebody. He was already on a short leash so she was able to catch him pretty quickly. It turns out the person he jumped on recently had surgery and apparently he opened up one of their stitches. My girlfriend spoke with the person to make sure they were ok and if they needed help, but they assured her it wasn't a problem. Instead of talking to the leasing office about it they decided to call the police. We were just informed about it from somebody at the leasing office who was just as shocked as we were about how it was handled. I haven't seen the video of it yet, but I am very nervous about the repercussions of the whole ordeal. We have been trying to eliminate this behaviour, but he is a very stubborn dog. Does anybody have any suggestions about how to approach the situation? I know there's a possibility that the building evicts our dog, but I am more worried about if he will be taken by the police. In the eyes of the law is this on the same level as a bite?"
687,"[Help] Thinking about adopting a specific dog, potentially for therapy work - question about skittishness?",dogs,t3_a5n1dv,8,False,False,a5n1dv,"Hey y'all - as the title says, I'm thinking about adopting a specific dog that's currently in a foster home. I would absolutely love to do therapy work with whomever I end up adopting, although if he/she doesn't end up being good at it or enjoying it, his/her first job will always be as a pet/life partner/snuggle buddy. But, I have a specific question about this dog.

I've met the dog in his foster home, and he's a such a doll. I think he'd be amazing at the people part of therapy work - his only goal in life seems to be wanting to stick his head in someone's lap and get pets, even if that person is a complete stranger (aka, me when I first met him). He's also done really well around tiny kids.

The only thing that gives me a little bit of pause is that the foster has said that in new *indoor* environments, he can both be a little skittish, but also is just super into sniffing things until he gets his sniffs out so it seems like he's still very into exploring new spaces? When going anywhere outdoors, whether he's been there before or not, he's a bundle of confidence and energy and is super excited about *EVERYTHING*. (If I end up adopting him, that'll be something we'll be working on a bit!) I've been around a lot of dogs and have trained quite a few in CGC skills, etc., but I've never really heard of this particular quirk - usually for skittish/nervous dogs, they're just generally skittish/nervous in new environments, rather than just indoors.

I didn't see this for myself since our first introduction, at the foster's request, was at her place. He seemed incredibly comfortable and calm. But, I'll be seeing him in a new indoor environment this weekend - she'll be bringing him over to my place.

I know an important part of therapy work is being fairly comfortable in new environments. Is this something we think could be worked on? (E.g. just exposing him to A LOT of different indoor environments over time with lots of positive reinforcement, taking some confidence-building classes that are offered in my area, etc.). I almost think this is just that he's more used to being outdoors (he was found as a stray and no one really knows anything about his previous life) and might just need some time to get more used to being indoors in new places, but didn't really know for sure and wanted to see what others thought. He's estimated to be \~4 years old, if that makes any kind of difference."
688,[Help]Can I keep a lapinkoira as a single person?,dogs,t3_a5lnls,6,False,False,a5lnls,"Basically the title.

I owned a german shepherd for several years which died 2 years ago, and I thought about getting a new dog because I miss having an animal around me. Sadly, a shepherd is not an option again - my old one, somehow, had no desire to protect anything which was awesome, but I can't rely on that since shepherds usually are very protective and that's highly undesirable behavior for me. However, I've always liked lapinkoiras which is a nordic breed that seems to fit perfectly for me: Active, but not too active, no interest in hot weather but loves winter, intelligent, capable of challenging dog sport, totally my kind of dog. Sadly, I'm not quite sure if such a dog would fit me. 

The dog would basically never be alone, I'm working 8 hours a day, but the office allows dog and everybody is happy if another one is joining the ""family"", so he always has a lot of people around him. I can take him for a walk in the morning (~30 min), during lunch (1 hour) and in the evening, I could perform other activities to make sure he's not underworked. We have two other dogs in the office, one dog where nobody knows what it is (it was a street dog in bulgaria where my boss found him and just took him in during a business trip) and the other one is some maltese-like dog, both super calm and not aggressive, it's very important my dog fits in fine without having an argument with the other ones all the time.

I'm not quite sure if I can keep any nordic dogs tho, I do have a lot of experience with dogs but not quite with nordic ones. So I thought I ask here first if anybody can tell me that keeping a lapinkoira is possible under these circumstances. If not, are there any other options? I did look at alaskan malamutes which do look pretty nice too, but they seem to be very similar to lapis."

690,[Discussion] How Can I Tell If My Two Retrievers Really Trust Me?,dogs,t3_a5kmmf,4,False,False,a5kmmf,"So I always thought that my two beautiful and handsome dogs are way more insightful and perceptive about interpreting human behaviour than you might have previously thought was ever possible.   


**How Can I tell If My Two Dogs Really Trust Me?**

  
Some other long time dog owners also told me recently that in fact dogs have been shown to be able to explain to us whether or not to trust another person, particularly their owner.

I have two dogs, both golden retrievers, one called Barnaby and the other called Ruben. They are so sweet and loving but while I always thought they trusted me I always wondered how you can be sure. I even looked at a fair bit of research on the subject such as this study from the [animal cognition journal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-014-0816-2).   


**Trust is a Bond**  
As every dog owner knows you can't just talk to your dog like you would a person. You have to interpret their emotions, mannerisms and reactions to determine whether they are completely with you right? I have done further reading on the bond between owner and dog and it is truly fascinating such as this [piece from Blissful Dog](https://blissfuldog.org/does-your-dog-trust-you/) on how you determine whether a dog really trusts you or not as well as right here at  r/dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

**So Is Trust Always Reciprocated?**  
How many of us our accept that while our dogs are supposed to bond and be part of the family should they automatically trust us, their owners?. So of course you trust your dog, but does your dog actually trust you?

If you are a loving dog owner and you value the relationship and bond that you have forged with your dog. Then it is worth knowing the value of consistency when interacting with your faithful hound. Lest they start to trust you less. In other words do as you say and show your dog that you are true to them and they will reward you in kind.

I think this whole bond thing and the reciprocal trust between dog and owner is just totally remarkable. I know that I would actually feel gutted if I think my two lovely dogs no longer believed me over something and I would do anything to get them to change their minds again haha.  
What does everyone here think about the trust that they have forged between themselves and the furry family friend? I'd be interested to read up?"

His previous owner gave me a ton of toys, explaining his favorite ones, that he likes to play a lot. From my understanding, he was very rarely walked. It was a ""go to the back yard to potty and play with some toys inside"" lifestyle. 

His new life style- snuffle mat or a food dispenser for meals, dog park every day, between 1-5 miles on leash walks, about 20 minutes of off leash/away from the dog park play (it's a semi open field that goes to the river. Tons of wildlife and critters to sniff after), and of course, training (going over basics that he knows or learning new things). Now, there have been a few ""off"" days (severe depression) where at most I take him out front to potty. Those are rare but it shows me he's ok if we have bad days. 

But in the 5 months I've had him, he's played with his toys like 3 times. I bought him new ones, he'll play with those that day then he's over it. During my depressive modes, he doesn't play with them either. Previous owner could get him to do a few games of fetch but I throw it, sometimes he'll bring it back, other times he'll sniff it and look at me like, ""uhh, you dropped something, gonna pick it up?"" 

I would like to think he enjoys our lifestyle. But am I working him too hard? He's almost 5 so beyond the puppy/ teenage stage but not yet at the ""I'm too old for this shit"" stage lol

701,[Help] Behavior - Dog chewing shoes when gone,dogs,t3_a5ni68,7,False,False,a5ni68,"* Age - ~2 yrs

* Location - USA

* Breed - Shepherd mix

* Sex - Female

About a month ago, my doggo started playing with shoes that are on a shoe rack by the door every so often whenever I'm gone. I should have corrected the behavior immediately but it has escalated to being more frequent and more than just tossing them around (tore up a slipper's insole and ripped up laces). At first I didn't do anything but pick them back up so I think that was the major mistake. 

Here's my plan of action and what I've done so far, I'd love to hear any advice or feedback:

* I conveniently put all of her toys by the shoe rack so I've moved them to a different place and attempt to make it clear what's a toy/not.

* When I come home, I quickly scold her with a stern but regular volume voice (which she reacts to by sulking and staring at the wall because she doesn't want to look at me when I'm mad at her, her cuteness makes this very difficult to do) and then completely ignoring her for awhile.

* Next I plan on buying some deterrent spray (hopefully odorless, would love suggestions!) to put on my shoes because I believe the best way to deter the behavior would be for her to not like doing it anymore.

* If that doesn't work, I'll move my shoes somewhere else.

Would love to hear about anyone else's experience or guidance, thanks!"

703,[Help] 4 month old puppy is chasing (and sometimes catching) the cat. Help!!,dogs,t3_a5kp1d,5,False,False,a5kp1d,"So... basically the title. Our cat is 9 years old and about 15lbs. The puppy, on the other hand, is 4 months old and twice that size - our vet figures she'll be about 60lbs as an adult. So obviously we need to nip this problem in the bud NOW before someone gets hurt. I'm not sure what to do anymore because all the usual advice isn't working.

Most of the time they are fine together - a few swats from the cat and she learned quickly to give him his space most of the time. She'll back up if he hisses or raises his paw to swat her. She doesn't chase the cat every time she sees him, usually she is just curious and will occasionally come give him a sniff or try to lay down beside him.. but the cat doesn't like it. If she gets too close, he runs.. and then she chases. She stops when the cat gets the high ground but sometimes she's too fast and I have seen her with his whole body in her jaws. Not biting hard enough to hurt him thankfully, but she's basically trying to play with him as if he was another dog and it is not ok. I would rather she stayed calm around him and hopefully they can be friends one day.. or just ignore each other completely.

They are never unsupervised together. The whole house is ""catified"" with places he can jump up and get out of reach, plus baby gates blocking the puppy's path. We practice ""leave it"" almost every day - basically whenever she looks at the cat or tries to go near him I say leave it and reward if she looks at me instead. But she still chases him at least once a day... and the cat keeps coming back for more! He won't hang out in the other room -  he wants to be with the family too, but the puppy is making it difficult. Pretty much the only time they are fine together is when they are both sleepy - then I catch them chilling pretty close together without incident.. until the puppy wakes up enough to notice the cat and want to investigate.

I really worry that the cat will get hurt one day and it'll be all my fault for not training the puppy properly. Any advice is greatly appreciated... thanks!!"

709,[Discussion] My 11 year old golden retriever's grain-free diet related heart problem is better after 6 months of heart meds and taurine supplements!,dogs,t3_a86iko,64,False,False,a86iko,"Long Post Warning, but I think it’s worth posting about and want to be thorough!

*Note: I’m using the veterinarian’s exact diagnosis throughout this post, as she would email me all her notes every time we would go for a checkup.*

TLDR: My 11 year old golden retriever was diagnosed with congestive heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which turned out to be due to her life long grain free diet and the critically low levels of taurine it caused. After six months of medication, taurine supplements and swapping her to dog food that is not grain free, she now has a healthy heart and is off all of her medication and supplements! And, she's got more pep in her step then she's had in at least a year!

Edit: spelling

—

Our 11 year old golden retriever Lilly has been a happy and healthy gal her whole life,  say except for a rock swallowing incident when she was about 4 years old and a few bad earaches that turned out to be due to a thyroid problem that’s been managed by medication for a couple of years now.

These last 6 months, though, they have been pretty tough. After a few, what we thought were minor issues and a few vet visits, we were hoping we were yet again being overly cautious when we took Lilly back to the vet in June. She had been coughing, had lost a lot of weight even though she was eating (being picky but still eating, nonetheless) and just seemed off… Unfortunately, it turned out that we weren’t being overly cautious. Something was wrong and our vet wanted us to take Lilly to the local emergency/specialty clinic right away. We knew she had quite a bit of fluid around her heart, but by the end of the night the admitting ER vet was discussing everything from potential cancer to even putting her down. We decided the plan of action would be to drain the fluid and see what we were up against and go from there.

Here is the exact diagnosis from Lilly’s specialist, at the clinic:

*Based on today's evaluation, we have diagnosed Lilly with congestive heart failure secondary to a heart muscle disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM. In Lilly’s case, the degree of changes to the heart are severe, and congestive heart failure (retention of fluid) has developed. After diagnosis of heart failure due to this disease, the average survival is about 3 months, though some dogs do not respond well to therapy and some dogs live well for much longer times (even years).*

Three different medications (Lasix 50mg, Enalapril 10mg and Vetmedin 10mg)/ three pills, twice a day was what we were sent home with. That, and the best-worst-case scenario we could have got. It wasn’t cancer, and at least we could try to keep her feeling better, and pray for the best outcome. 3-6 months (which was average) left with her was not what we were wanting, but at least we wouldn’t have to put her down right away. We were going to enjoy whatever time we had left with her.

Next check up comes a few weeks later and this is where it gets interesting. (If you’ve hung in this long, keep going) Lilly had perked up and was doing well on her meds. Our doctor at the Specialty Clinic was pleased with how she’s doing, and we end up discussing Lilly’s diet- specifically if she was on a grain free diet. She was her whole life, up until about March 2018, and I only stopped the grain free diet because I thought she was getting picky in her old age, so I was trying anything to get her to eat… Here again is her specialist’s exact notes at this visit:

*Lilly’s case is very interesting in the fact that she has been on a grain free diet historically. As discussed today, there has been a trend in veterinary medicine with grain free diets and development of dilated cardiomyopathy, particularly in Golden Retrievers. Although the mechanism is not known as to why this is starting to occur, if low taurine is identified, supplementation with taurine would be recommended. With taurine deficiency related dilated cardiomyopathy, the prognosis may be improved with supplementation. We have sent taurine levels out today to investigate if supplementation is needed for Lilly.*

Here’s the thing- we had Lilly on a grain free diet because we thought that’s what we were “supposed” to do. Only the best for our girl, right? You’d have to be living under a rock to not see all of these grain-free pet food commercials. It seemed like the responsible thing a pet owner should do for their 4-legged companion, but after speaking with the specialist she suggested we stop feeding Lilly AND our other two year old golden retriever grain free food right away. She let me know that there’s not been any studies showing grain-free is any better than food with grain in it, and unless your dog has some sort of legit reason to not eat food with grain it in, there’s really no benefit from doing it.

When Lilly’s taurine level panel came back, it was pretty alarming. Normal range for a dog is 60-150 nmol/mL (whatever that means). Critical level is less than 40. Lilly was at a 15!

Specialist’s exact diagnosis:

*I am so happy to report that Lilly’s taurine levels came back at a critically low level, indicating that this may be the reason for the dilated cardiomyopathy. I would like to start supplementing her with 2000 mg twice daily of taurine and would like to recheck echocardiogram in 3 months. Typically in taurine-responsive DCM, we expect a generally longer prognosis than in idiopathic DCM and our best hope would be to able to reverse the cardiac changes and be able to wean the cardiac medications and just maintain on taurine. Lilly's grain-free diet has already been stopped (important as this has been recently implicated in possibly causing the taurine deficiency).*

6 pills in the morning and 6 pills in the evening, supplementing with taurine and taking 3 different medications for her heart. We got to celebrate her 11th birthday in July and she (along with our two year old) were absolutely loving their Kibbles ’n’ Bits!

Three months later Lilly went to her normal (amazing) vet, for her normal yearly check-up and things seemed pretty good! She was tolerating her meds well. We were happy. Normal vet was happy and after getting her check-up results, Specialist was happy. They told us to keep it up and we would check her again in 3 months.

Last week Lilly went in for that six month check up. I’m not going to lie, we were nervous. We had made peace knowing that if these test results did not come out the way we were hoping that we had 6 incredible months with Lilly, where we really got to love on her and learn from her, but we were praying for not just good results, but great results. Still, in the waiting room, I was nervous.

I couldn’t have possibly imagined how that visit would go, but miraculous is a great word to describe it! After 6 months of supplementing her with taurine and giving her the heart medications she wasn’t just doing good, she **is** doing great!!!

Her specialist’s exact diagnosis:

*We are beyond pleased to report that Lilly's echocardiogram is now normal, with the diet change, medications and taurine supplementation. Her cardiac ultrasound now shows a very normal heart. Therefore, we can discontinue her cardiac medications and taurine and continue her current diet. Her prognosis is now great and she does not have any residual evidence of heart disease. Wonderful news for sweet Lilly!!*

No more congestive heart failure!!! Our girl has a healthy heart and we are beside ourselves with joy and praise and thankfulness for answered prayers!

This has been a long post, but it’s been a long six months. As many of you surely know on this sub, there is now an FDA investigation into a potential connection between diet and cases of canine heart disease. The internet, like always, is fuuuuuuuull of opinions. I not only have an opinion but have first-hand experience, and it’s worth sharing. This happened to Lilly. This is not just a post on the internet now, my girl went through this.

&amp;#x200B;

I would bet that all of y’all on this sub love your dogs like we love ours and I want everyone to know what happened here. Maybe this will help someone else, if not about choosing what type of dog food to buy, then giving you something to consider if your dog is having these type of heart issues, then perhaps it would be worth getting a taurine panel ran. But, beyond this, don’t get caught up in the latest and greatest, just because everyone else is doing it. You got to do what is right for you. Sometimes that is high end, never-even-touched-a-kernel-of-a-grain dog food and sometimes it’s Kibbles ’n’ Bits.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry to ramble, but thanks for reading. If you have any questions, I'll be glad to try to answer as best that I can- if not tonight, I'll check back tomorrow and as needed.

711,[fluff] reading your RIP posts has made me a better dog parent.,dogs,t3_a84i47,8,False,False,a84i47,"I read the RIP posts often. I can only imagine the heart break that people feel when their beloved puppers passes. Inevitably it makes me feel like I should be spending more time with my dog, Clyde. He's 3 and a half and I hope that I have a lot of time left with him, but nothing is for sure. He is so sweet, and even though he's not my whole world, my wife and I are his whole world.  Not to say that I ever felt like a bad dog parent, but now when I'm home from work,  I play lots more tug of war, we go on much longer walks, and I spend a lot less time on my computer or watching TV. So, thank you. "
712,[Discussion] Couple from which we got our dog 2 years ago trying to invite themselves over. Extremely inappropriate or am I overreacting?,dogs,t3_a87n61,22,False,False,a87n61,"My partner and I got a mixed-breed puppy in March 2017. I emphasize mixed-breed to make clear we didn't get it from a breeder, this was just a middle-aged couple whose own dogs had had a ""happy accident"".

Now, when they came to hand over the puppy (we even paid for it, signed a contract etc.) the wife was quite emotional - cried, even. They have eight other dogs at home and Just got this litter of three - if it had been her way I'm sure she would have wanted to keep them too, but I suspect her husband had the last say. Since they came over to visit us to see if the pup would be getting a good home, they now knew our address. 

Since then, the lady has continuously attempted to contact us and arrange a visit several times per year. At one point, around our dog's first birthday, she called and asked if she can come over and bring him a toy. We said it's not a good idea. She said ""Oh but I'm in the neighborhood, it'll only be a few minutes!"". We said we're going to see family and are getting ready to leave. That was the end of it, or so we thought. 

My partner's sister came to pick us up and as we got into the car she said ""X was just here asking if I lived here and could let her into the building. I said I'm just waiting to pick you up and she flustered and said 'oh you must be Y's sister, you look so alike!' Then she gave me the present for Pup and left.""

So apparently she thought we were lying/hurried over regardless and was looking for a way to get in and catch us at home. I freaked out. But anyway, after that there was radio silence for a while and I thought she got the message that this isn't her dog anymore and she should back off. Until a few months back, when she tried to call my partner again, several times. Then texted him, asking if we could meet up. He didn't reply.

Yesterday we got a Christmas card from her, her husband and ""the doggies"". Nice gesture if it had come from anyone else, but for me personally now it just makes my blood boil. I'm having nightmares that this woman will somehow, some day, make her way into our building, knock on our door and kidnap our dog once we open. I'm overexaggerating, I know, but I am kinda angry, so forgive me.

713,[Vent] My cousin bought a yellow lab and literally never walks it,dogs,t3_a7ybfw,114,False,False,a7ybfw,"Need to rant a bit about shitty pet owners.

So I've come home to see the fam for xmas and today my aunt tells me that my cousin (SC for shitty cousin) never walks her lab puppy, not even once a week. SC is always working/going to uni/interning and isn't home most of the time, so she says she doesn't have the time to walk the puppy. The poor pup was shut in a cage for the majority of the day until she outgrew it, now she gets to roam around my cousin's bedroom (which is the apartment's living room) and the covered concrete courtyard... so \~40m2 of space with no sunlight. ALL DAY. EVERYDAY.

SC bought the puppy on a whim, never trains her (although she said she's trained the puppy to not need walks?!) and has no plan to spay the puppy because of the cost. I think the puppy has been taken out in total about 5 times and she's now about 8 months old.

I've just been pissed about this for the pass few hours and thinking about what I should say to SC when I next see her. Welcome to suggestions

EDIT: SC lives at her own place with two flatmates, doggo is locked out in the courtyard these days when nobody is home so that's where she does her business. SC can definitely afford vet bills/a dog walker, but doesn't want to fork out it seems. My aunt isn't her mum, so there's only so much she can do/say, SC is going on another 3 week holiday in 2 months and my aunt's already offered to dog sit for free.  She and my uncle loves dogs so the doggo will at least have some free air and walks with them.

I would help her rehome doggo in a second, I'm just don't think SC would want to part with her because she's cute, quiet and doesn't make too much of a mess. There's only so much I can do because I live overseas for work and I hardly come home. The ideal scenario is that SC steps up, I'm just afraid that she'll agree to everything I say, promise to do better, do jackshit in reality and I'm a 9 hr flight away do anything about it. "

716,"[Rip]Pepper, 1.5 year old mexican mutt",dogs,t3_a7zmws,29,False,False,a7zmws,"Dear Pepper,

I had been searching for a dog like you for months, and got lucky when a rescue agency immediately replied to my request to see you. Most places wouldn't even respond to me, as I have a normal job, and would be a single dog parent. I'm assuming most didn't think that was ideal, but I was allowed to come see you anyway.

I got you when I had finished working on the movie The Incredibles 2, and took a few days off to go [meet you](https://imgur.com/NctPube), fall in love with you, and take you home. I remember being so nervous, I didn't have a crate to put you in, and I didn't have a harness to keep you still while I was driving, but [you just sat there, watching the world go by, completely happy and perfect.](https://imgur.com/jM81rbH) I had never taken care of anything else on my own. I've almost always been alone, and you fixed that.

You adjusted to my life so fast. You didn't bark, you learned how to use the doggy door in a matter of days, and you were so easy to take care of. You had walks every day, by me and a dog walker, and you barely pulled, but you slammed on the brakes all the time to stop and sniff everything. You had so many beds, [a bed in every room](https://imgur.com/Tl89iVZ). So many treats. I put my heart into you and you always just gave me as much love as you could. [You would fall asleep on me](https://imgur.com/pcLVSqu), and I'll never forget how I would let a big sigh out before going to sleep and you would always do the same. Just a deep breath before bed. Just like me.

There were some tough times, you had a bad case of [puppy warts](https://imgur.com/Yzk1zS0) that scared the hell out of me. You got over that, and then had urinary issues, which pills fixed, and then allergies, which pills fixed, but of all things I wish I had known the state of your kidneys.

We did so many things together, so much of my time and life over the past 10 months has been dedicated to you. I made you [puzzles and toys](https://imgur.com/xLJ3YWo). I learned how to dremel your nails and clip your toe hairs. You hated this at first and would shake and tremble when put in the harness, but eventually [you got used to it](https://imgur.com/iUCxx1l) and I hope you realized it was necessary.

You always went wild [at the beach,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WYEeFiWUWg) and you loved all the other dogs. Never aggressive, but a little shy. I remember when we would go on hikes and you learned to [sit and wait for other dogs to come up to you, all on your own.](https://imgur.com/6MUac6M) You were perfect in so many ways and you learned tricks incredibly fast. You were such a good girl.

You learned [how to sneeze on command in a matter of minutes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgpTScP374s) You learned so much and could have learned so much more. The [list of tricks was constantly growing and you loved it.](https://imgur.com/cMsaC8L) 

You helped me meet a [wonderful and caring woman](https://imgur.com/2VTzppj) who was there for you until the end. She spent days with you. Took you on adventures. To dog parks, beaches, all over when I couldn't due to work, and taught you even more tricks. But you didn't always need attention and stimulation. You were content just [sitting in the sun.](https://imgur.com/SVkUOaI) You were so chill, and exactly what I wanted in a dog.

Only a month ago we [hopped in the truck](https://imgur.com/8facWri) and I took you to Tahoe to [see my parents for thanksgiving.](https://imgur.com/Srn6oOi) You got to see snow for the first time and [you absolutely loved it.](https://imgur.com/Zp7kjd4) This week we were supposed to go back there, you would have loved it, like you loved everything.

Heather took you to the beach last Tuesday while I was at work, and you [ran and ran for 3 hours straight.](https://imgur.com/KU9p08q) You probably had the time of your life. When we broke up, you seemed to slow down a little. You were less excitable, and I assumed it was because you missed Heather. But that night, after the beach, you woke me at 4am, yelping in my face. I pushed you away and couldn't figure out what was wrong, so you went to the vet the next day. They did xrays, and poked and prodded, and gave you pain killers. They assumed you strained yourself running around at the beach, and I believed you would get better with rest.

But then you started yelping and screaming whenever you had to get up. You trembled and shook. And I thought you were just being a wuss. I've had sore muscles, and you just suck it up! But it got harder and harder for you to get up off the ground. The vet saw you again and prescribed different pain killers. You had such a hard time this last week and I became so frustrated. I was so scared that I would have to deal with a dog that gets sick every 2 months. This last week I watched you slowly die and I was so selfish and scared. You wouldn't lay down because it was so hard to get up. You would just come by and stand next to me, and [put your head on me.](https://imgur.com/q4pSMSD)

I went out and got you new toys, food, treats, doggy bags, expecting you to power through and recover. But 2 days ago you started to lose your appetite. You would wake up and [stumble even more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmglkILRZtM) but then be completely [normal a few minutes later.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCBxVdjeeaw) I got so annoyed with all the accidents around the house. At 4am I tossed you outside because you started peeing on me. I wish I knew you were failing from the inside out. I was running on so little sleep, you woke me every 3 hours for days.

I took you to the neurologist yesterday to get an mri done because I wanted more than anything for you to get better. I never considered that your kidneys could have failed. They said it was congenital, and there was nothing I could do. I wish I could have shown you the love I had for you over the last week instead of assuming it was a small speed bump in your life. This last week was tough. I didn't know and I'm sorry. My house is so empty. Your toys are still everywhere, your beds, your leashes and harnesses. I only had you for 10 months, but I wanted to have you for as many years as I could. [I love you Pepper.](https://imgur.com/HbYfOCI)"

Yesterday, I brought home my first dog. I've fostered a lot of dogs in the past but this is my first time figuring out issues without a rescue backing me up. And boy howdy, she has some issues.

She's a 4 year old bulldog who is SEVERLY overweight, has next to zero social skills, and has lived up to this point in either a kennel or run. She has diarrhea, and was being fed probiotic pills like treats (they gave her 3 while I was talking to them). She was being kept outside and smelled so bad that I had to ride home with the windows cracked.

I've got an appointment set up with my vet for after Christmas. We stopped by the office to introduce her and make the appointment, and the main thing she was concerned with was her weight. She weighed in at around 67lbs.

So I need a little bit of advice.


How much should she be eating a day? Should I wean her down to a smaller amount slowly? She was being fed 2 cups of food, 3 times a day.


How fast should we increase our walks? She can almost make it around 1 city block before she starts getting tired right now.


My vet advised rice water and pumpkin for the upset tummy. How much of this should I offer her? How often? If this doesn't help, whats the next step until her appointment?


Do you have any tips for socializing her safely? Or anything else that I might find helpful?"
721,[Help] Does my aloof dog like paw massages?,dogs,t3_a8b1jm,2,False,False,a8b1jm,"She technically belongs to my parents. They adopted her as a puppy thinking she would be a small lab mix.

Aside from that she doesn’t show a lot of love for her people. We love her just the same. 

In the last few years we have noticed she does something kind of odd. When we’re sitting down she’ll paw at us pretty persistently. Again, she’s big so you can’t exactly ignore it either. We give her pets but  that doesn’t seem to be what she wants. Food is in her bowl so that’s not an issue. The only thing that seems to stop her is holding her paw and kind of squeezing it a bit...like a hand massage for her paw. Obviously she will stop (because her paw is in our hand) but she genuinely seems to enjoy it. When we stop, she’ll paw at us even more aggressively. 

Does my dog like paw massages? Is this totally weird or does anyone else’s dog like that? Is she trying to tell us something else?

What he and I don’t love is when random people approach us, and randomly start petting the dog without asking first. 

My dog does NOT like to be quickly approached by strangers, and WILL bark at you if you come at him too quickly. This gives people the notion that my dog is “mean” or “aggressive”. 

He’s nothing close to mean, he just hates being randomly approached with a hand in his face to pet him. 

Please ASK to pet my dog, I can’t stand people who don’t ask. Not only is it rude, you never know how my dog or anyone’s dog will react to you randomly petting it.

Once the family left everyone took a sigh of relief, glad it was all over and no one got hurt.

726,[Help] Luxating patella surgery in small dog,dogs,t3_a8a5jv,1,False,False,a8a5jv,"Hello,

I have a Maltese who's recently gone through Luxating patella surgery. She's about 3 weeks post op and tonight we noticed dark red marks appear on the inside of her leg, kinda like bruising. She's about 2.5 years and 4.5kg

She's been a nightmare to try and keep relaxed. She constantly wants to jump and run even in crate confinement. She's actually knocked over the pen we've been keeping her in while trying to escape. This was just 2 days after the cast came off

To be fair, she's calm for the majority of the time. For the most part she's just lying down relaxing. The problems come when the door bell or phone rings - she gets overly excited and jumps. 

Today, the doorbell rang and she jumped a few times. We picked her up to stop that and we noticed these marks appear on her leg. She has no (apparent) pain, she can still walk like she has been and it seems like nothing's wrong. 

She's going to the vet tomorrow (well, in 9 hours) but just for peace of mind, we're hoping it's just some bruising but we don't like that it happened right after jumping. 

Does anyone have experience with this surgery, and what could have happened to cause a bruise/internal bleeding like that? Keep in mind she seems absolutely normal like nothing's happened.

Thanks all"

729,[Breeds] Need help choosing a breed,dogs,t3_a88wql,3,False,False,a88wql,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I've never owned a dog before, but I have some experience looking after them. I've done a lot of research though, and will do more once I've decided on the breed.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Either is fine. I just want it to be the right one for me.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Loyal, intelligent but not too stubborn, quick to learn and quick to obey once trained.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Vizsla has always been dear to me, but from what I've heard, they're only sold to homes that hunt.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Advanced obedience, some agility as a hobby. Running off-leash so we can go hiking together.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2 hours on average.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours. Dog park a few times a week, hikes and swimming whenever possible (summers are short here), agility once a week and long walks daily. I don't have a yard though.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'll do the nail clipping and such myself as needed, but I prefer dogs with shorter hair that only needs to be brushed maybe once a week and are easy to keep clean and stink free.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium. I prefer bigger dogs, but they're not always good for apartments.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I can handle, slobber is a no-no. I want a breed that either barks very little, or can be trained to not bark.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Doesn't matter that much.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Preferably not by barking. Can either be friendly or aloof, but not aggressive.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Preferably not. Will have to get along with my sister's smaller dog, as they'll be spending a lot of time together.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* High prey drive. I don't want the dog going after my cats, or any wild life when off leash.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* There's always someone in the house, or I'll take the dog with me.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* No preference, walking and playing with the dog occasionally.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have two cats.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, whenever I'm visiting my family. The kids are old and respectful enough to handle dogs with care, but obviously can be loud and energetic.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Yes. No restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* No such laws.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Short, mild summers and long, cold winters (up to -30c). If the dog is averse to cold, I'll get a warm doggy coat for our walks.

We have two medium-size dogs, a five-year-old male Brittany spaniel/blue heeler mix and a female three-year-old pointer mix. I've done a lot of work with them individually on loose leash walking. And, one-on-one, they are pretty good. But it is hard to walk them together. One will see something and want to stop or mark or see another dog/person and want to interact. They also get a little competitive with who is in front of the other dog, and they react to other people/dogs/animals on the walk differently than if they were alone.

They are not small dogs, so it requires a lot of energy to keep them in check on a walk together. Any advice? I have been taking turns walking one in the morning and the other in the evening and swapping who goes when, but it takes a lot of time. And, always, always, the dog who is left home is upset. My husband can walk them both together, but he is able to keep them at a moderate jog -which minimizes chance for distraction--the whole time. I am not as fit.:-( Are there strategies for walking multiple dogs that are different from walking a single dog by your side?

Neither of us are first time pet-owners (we have cats, and have fostered dogs) and by all means our application doesn't seem to be the issue here. I don't know if it's just my luck, the rescue foundations near me, or the time of the year, but it seems that none of the rescue organizations care about responding back. I've been in touch with 3 organizations near me and 2 in other states and it takes days, sometimes weeks, to get any kind of information from them about a dog who I think might be a good fit and would like more information on. When they do end up responding it's usually a one-line unenthusiastic email about the questions I've asked with no interest in a follow-up, or the dog has already been adopted so I have to start the process all over again. Two shelters have said that they'll get back to me about another dog because they have my information and I've been through the application process and gotten approved, but then...nothing. Silence. I have to keep prodding to ask them to respond to my last email or phone call. I understand that people who work there are volunteers taking time out of their day to find the perfect home for these pups and are overwhlemed with all the responsibilities, but I'm getting so frustrated that I'm thinking of giving up.


I assumed working with a shelter or dog adoption agency would be easy but this process has been dragging on for way too long with what seems to be a one sided attempt at adoption. It seems I'm the only one who is excited and invested in giving a home to a dog. Is this normal and am I being a nuisance, or should I make more effort into getting in touch with the shelters/try my hand elsewhere? This is my first time adopting instead of fostering so I'm super confused why this is so incredibly different and difficult than fostering. Any advice would be really, really appreciated. Thank you!"
735,[Help] My dog has been having paw problems for over a year,dogs,t3_a8b28h,0,False,False,a8b28h,"My Febe is a Maltese, and she’ll be 11 in February. For the past year and a half she has developed a nasty habit of licking and sometimes gnawing at her paws. It’s not even a specific paw; she alternates between the four. Because of this, the fur on her paws start to thin and her skin gets dry, flaky, and generally inflamed. Sometimes she even chews them to the point of bleeding.
We’ve tried many things. This includes numerous visits to various vets, and for the most part they just brush it off as allergies, but it’s rare that they actually attempt to fix it. One vet gave us medicine to give to her daily, and it seemed to work for about a week before she started at it again.
We purchased lil booties for Febe to wear to prevent her from chewing, but they’re a little loose (she has tiny feets) so they always manage to slip off. 
My dad read somewhere online that it helps to give her a little spoon of coconut oil every day, and we’ve been doing that for about a week, but still no change. We’re also concerned about the coconut oil because you know how those home remedies can be. I don’t wanna make her sick.
I love my Febe more than anything in the world. I completely adore her and I’m worried! I don’t want her to be in pain. She just won’t stop chewing her paws.

We have never had any issues with them before, both my pets have had surgeries there and they have always handled all the issues well.
However my dog recently got a bath and a shave there as she got lots of gross stuff stuck in her fur, and she came back itchy and distressed.
She felt discomfort in one ear and had a few missing patches of fur, as well as a lot of redness around her face and her underbelly.
We didn’t think too much of it as we thought it was just from the gunk pulling on her fur before. However the next day we saw she had scratched her chest raw and had lots of dandruff-like bits all over her.
I was worried it was dermatitis or something like that so I immediately scheduled an appointment. They did blood tests and skin scrapes and when they came back, they said it was probably an allergic reaction to the bath they gave her and that I should just wash her again at home with a special shampoo they gave me. 
I thought they would apologise for not spotting the problem when we went to pick her up after her bath, or some form of compensation, like the shampoo on the house. Instead we got charged about €100 for the consultation.

So we cleaned it up and it seemed to go back to normal. But now it seems his cheeks are always pus-y. 

So I looked it up and I believe it might be because his teeth are infected. I found that infected teeth can push against the dog's cheeks and cause the swelling followed by eventual burst with pus coming out. 

I'm pretty sure that is what my dog is suffering from but I'm not positive.  To be honest, it doesn't seem to bother him at all. He doesn't show signs of discomfort. We can pet his cheeks and head and he won't pull away. He still eats food normally. But it is pretty gross and I feel bad for him.

We are currently feeding our dogs Orijen (by Champion Petfoods) senior dog food which they have been eating since 2015 or possibly earlier.


In regards to heart disease... In 2017 the vet mentioned that my dog had a low-grade heart murmur. Fast forward to last month. She started coughing a bit and when we took her to the vet, we learned that she has a grade 3 heart murmur now and the radiograph shows an enlarged heart. She is currently on some heart medication. I believe one of the medications caused loss of appetite and heavy breathing but did resolve the coughing (Furosemide). She is on Vetmedin now and has regained her appetite and breathing normally!


As for diet... I recently learned two things:

1) The current FDA investigation about the potential connection between DCM and diet containing peas, lentils, other legume seeds, or potatoes

2) Orijen, which I always thought was a high-quality locally-made dog food (I'm from Canada), changed their formula and moved their plant to the US in early 2016 or late 2015. Based on some posts in this subreddit, apparently the new formula uses less meat and more peas/lentils/legumes for protein which I have noticed in the ingredients list.


I am not saying there is a connection between Orijen (by Champion Petfoods) and my dog's enlarged heart but I want to be safe than sorry and avoid those ingredients. (Though I have found some news articles about this brand and heart disease, i.e. https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/investigations/-we-were-in-tears-heart-disease-toxins-among-growing-fears-in-boutique-dog-foods)


Please recommend me a good dog food brand! I have been reading as much as possible on dog nutrition and there is so much misinformation out there still.

What should I have done?",dogs,t3_a88xao,10,False,False,a88xao," I was just walking my dog minding my own buisness when an older man came up to me and screamed in my face to ""pick up this damn dog shit."" Thing is, my dog pooped about 20 minutes earlier and I definitly picked it up, as I ALWAYS do. There's no way she took a poop where he claimed she did as my eyes are always glued on her and she takes foreeeever to find a good position to poop, so I would've definitly noticed. She didn't even pee, so I have no fucking idea how he thought she took a shit.   


I tried to reason with him like ""Oh sorry, you must be mistaken, my dog didn't poop, I would've picked it up. Sorry for the misunderstanding."" But he continued to scream in my face saying that he watched me and to pick up her damn shit. I said to him if he was so sure to please show me where it was and I'd gladly pick it up but he just continued to scream at me. I was seriously scared. What the hell should I pick up if she didn't poop????    


He went on about how he wants to kill all dogs and their owners and how disgusting we all are. I slowly took off in the other direction being scared shitless and not wanting to be screamed at any longer for something I didn't even do. What should I have done in a situation like this? What would you have done? Do I need to be afraid of the safety of my dog? Should I look for another route to walk from now on?"
751,[fluff] [discussion] hug your puppers real tight and get great vets,dogs,t3_a7r3ee,49,False,False,a7r3ee,"my 9 yr old berner was diagnosed with type 3 cancer today and luckily we caught it early thanks to second opinions. 

A couple weeks ago a bump appeared on my dogs brow. in less than a week later it was the size (and feel) of a golf ball. We took her to the clinic and they prescribed antibiotics. However, it didn’t get any better, nor did it get worse. We took her back and they said not to worry that it was an infection and puss. Again, more antibiotics. 

Finally I decided to take her to the animal hospital (expensive but worth it) and turns out she has cancer. Her oncologist really explained the process and connected to my dog even though it was her first time with her ❤️ She didn’t immediately give us “the sleep talk” but rather explained options and customized treatments. 

although the treatments won’t rid her of cancer we want her to be happy and live her best life. She’s a happy baby, she isn’t in pain, and we are picking her up soon.

754,[Discussion] [Walk] [Tail] Why might a dog love taking walks but his tail doesn’t show it?,dogs,t3_a86cce,3,False,False,a86cce,"So I have an 8-year-old hound mix who my family and I rescued when he was 10 months old. He’s very anxious in general as he has undergone multiple surgeries as a puppy to ensure a healthier life as he grew up. 

My dog’s name is DJ. Every time I pick up the leash and collar, he goes NUTS (in a good way)! His tail wags uncontrollably, he runs to the door, and bursts to the sidewalk when I open it for him. 

He does what every normal dog does on our walks: He looks around, he sniffs the trees and what-not, he focuses his attention on nearby dogs. But for some reason, his tail usually doesn’t wag while we walk. I know he loves to walk because of his reaction before and after. But it seems like he’s just a little nervous while me and him walk. His tail isn’t COMPLETELY in between his legs, but his tail is typically down and somewhat hunched inward (sometimes - not always). It could be because he’s an anxious dog in general - He doesn’t like aggressive behavior from other dogs and he’s extremely gentle.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience about this. He’s an amazing dog - my best friend! It’s just weird. Why would he love walking, yet act anxious on the walks? This isn’t a serious concern as he’s been like this for as long as I’ve known him, but I’m new to reddit and wanted to see if anyone wants to talk about it. Thank you!"

758,[HELP] Advice for reducing barking,dogs,t3_a863kt,2,False,False,a863kt,"I just moved into a triplex and my dog barks every time someone comes into the building. I was trying to just call him to me with treats and make him sit in his kennel or come to me on the couch, but that has stopped working and he is barking with a lot more intensity than before. He no longer barks every single time someone comes in, but the times he does he is really barking, sometimes growling also. 

Honestly I think part of the problem is the people in my building seem to have a lot of short term ""guests"" who just come in the main door, go to their unit, knock and then leave again within 5-10 minutes. Some times they'll have people coming in and out like that for a couple hours. This also means that hes barking when they first come in the building, when they knock and then when they leave again and it is pretty disruptive. 

My neighbors have already complained to the landlord about the barking and I feel lost for what to do since a lot of the advice I see is to ignore it or call him to me but that's not working anymore. I'd really appreciate any other thoughts or advice. 
Thanks so much! "
759,[Help] My dog is obsessive and has severe seperation anxiety,dogs,t3_a87mbl,0,False,False,a87mbl,"I rescued my grandmother's dog, and she is roughly 10 yrs old.  We don't know anything about her past, but she has always had a rather fearful side to her which we believe could be from abuse based on how she reacts to certain movements.  I am only watching her temporarily, most likely for another month.
She has grown extremely attached to me to the point where I personally don't believe it is healthy.  She cries if I just go upstairs, she cries at night because she wants to sleep in my bed with me, she cries when I leave as well. When I am holding her she growls at my dad when he comes near.
She reacts very inwards towards others and becomes very stiff and alert.  She does not care to socialize at all with other dogs either. She also does not really know how to play. She just wants to be with me 24/7. It's one thing for her to be a lap dog but is it normal for a dog to be this obsessive? What can I do to help with her severe seperation anxiety? This issue has really put strains on my daily schedules as well as my sleep.
Many people say to just wait until I take her back home but she is not as happy when she is not with me and I want her to be able to live a happy life with my grandmother.  She does love my grandmother more than others but she is obsessed with me.

TLDR: My grandmothers dog has extreme seperation anxiety and is very obsessive and possessive over me.   "

761,"[Breeds] [discussion] my dad wants a dog like Spot, our dog who passed away last summer",dogs,t3_a87iq9,3,False,False,a87iq9,"My dads one wish for Christmas was for a dog like our old dog Spot. Spot was a great dog, and can’t ever be replaced by any other pup. He was from the humane society as a puppy when I was 7 (I’m now 22). I picked him out because of his stripe and spots on him. He was a terrier mix puppy. Black and white, not soft except his ears and head. 

Anyway, he says he wants Spot back again and I do too. Spot was my first dog ever. What I’m asking is a good breed or mix of breeds that will have similar traits as my old dog if possible. Or if we should just get another mix rescue dog. We are leaning toward rescue dog right now. 

Some things about Spot that my dad would like in another dog: 
1)Small but not miniature. Spot’s head I think was still below knee level for humans. He doesn’t want a big dog or a small yappy dog. 
2)He mentioned he wants a dog that will check if the “coast is clear” because Spot always did that. 
3)A dog that doesn’t whine 
4) a dog that doesn’t bark a lot or wonder away a lot
5) a dog that can handle being without humans for some time each day (because of work)

We have a large yard but we live close to a busy-ish road. We have a nice clean house with a small/ medium dog door. Our yard is very open and is near a forest. 

We have a mini pincer pekingese mix (Bandit) who whines a lot and always wants my mom. (Dad doesn’t like it, says he doesn’t want another Bandit). We also have 3 cats. Spot and my oldest cat were best buddies. Spot was the one who found him under the porch. I think ever since then my cat has been grumpy. 

Other traits:
Affectionate but easily trainable. 

I would appreciate any opinions or advice. I know we cannot get another Spot, but a dog with Spot traits would be ideal.

We are leaving him with a couple we found on Rover. They have a golden retriever that is very playful. They two of them have already met and we had a chance to walk around the sitter’s house and speak to them about our pup’s daily routine.

The only problem is, they haven’t watched many  dogs before. They are somewhat new to Rover and have only watched two dogs in the past few months. For some reason, I am nervous to leave our dog with an inexperienced dog sitter but we don’t have many options due to the holiday. Our last sitter fostered and boarded dozens of dogs and was also a vet at banfield animal hospital so I felt more comfortable leaving our pup with her.

We are leaving him for 4 nights. Has anyone had a bad experience on Rover? Any professional/experienced dog sitters in this subreddit that could lend some insight? I want to know if we are being too protective of him or if we should be concerned that this couple lacks experience dog sitting. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks!

She told me she was giving him some scratches when he randomly freaked out and bit her on the face. **She has since been to the ER and everything is fine.** Frank is a 2 year old Male Flat coated retriever. We got him from the pound 4 months ago, besides all this he's a very smart and intelligent dog. He knew the standard sit, stay , don’t piss in the house when we got him. He was very sweet and non aggressive but since we got him he has shown signs of protectiveness. A little with me and a lot with my GF. 

This is not the first time Frank has bitten before. **He bit me on the face** for laying down on his tail (by accident) and **bitten one of our close friends**. In that instance our friend had entered the door, Frank had given them the sniff test and was walking around just doing dog stuff and our friend felt un-easy, they turned away from frank then he bit them on the leg. 

Before he bit my girlfriend and I, we started taking him to dog training classes and even got a personal behavioral trainer, he was doing great. 

Once my GF parents find out about the bite they will demand that we either **give the dog away or kill him.** 

He’s generally a great dog besides all of the biting. My girl and I are unsure of what to do. Is there any hope of getting him to stop this shit or do we have to bite the bullet and give him away. 

**TLDR: Our dog that we have had for 4 months keeps fucking biting us and our friends, we don't know what to do, but we still love the dog.**"

I had a few bad encounters with friends aggressive dogs when I was young so when a dog shows aggression I get extremely scared. My Aunt came to Visit and is staying for two weeks with her rat terrier, her room is directly outside my room. My cat stays in my room and I keep the door closed at all times because she gets scared otherwise. My aunts dog has started to consider where my aunt sleep her territory and barks, growls and snaps at me when I leave or go to my room. My aunt at the start just laughed it off, I thought the dog would relax and realize I don’t care about my aunts stuff and just want to go to my room, but she continues to freak out and it is causing me immense stress. It prevents me from using the bathroom or getting things from my room or checking on my cat. My parents gave me the squirt bottle to spray my aunts dog whenever she does this. My aunts dog has also been only targeting me, I’ve given her treats, I’ve ignored her, I’ve tried to be as least threatening as I can be, then I’ve tried telling her no, now trying the squirt bottle.

&amp;#x200B;

She was at the hospital for a day or two and now she's back at my home. I have two other dogs and since she's not vaccinated, dewormed and no flea medication given yet she has to stay in my garden in case she passes anything to my dogs. She's currently on antibiotics for the next 5 days then I will bring her to the vet again. I walk her 2x a day and keep her company as much as I can but I have rescued kittens as well + my existing pets so I can only be there for her so often.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think she is afraid of me since she does come to me when I call for her with a tail wag. Her appetite has been ok, not really ravenous so she does refuse food sometimes and her stool is normal, no diarrhea of sorts. The thing is, she always tries to escape and every time after her walk she refuses to come back home and it breaks my heart. I feel back for removing her off the streets even though I think it's the right thing to do.. maybe she had someone caring for her while she was a stray or had dog friends. I don't know if I'm being too sensitive but I just feel bad for her. I want to immediately put her in my home with the rest of my dogs in a week's time after the vet visit but for now she has to be alone for awhile.

769,[DISCUSSION] My dog keeps urinating on the floor.,dogs,t3_a86hoq,6,False,False,a86hoq,"My dog Cassie (half Golden Retriever, half Border Collie) is a bit older than three months but not four months old yet. She seems (fingers crossed) to be fully housebroken for poop.

However, she will still pee on the floor. No signals or anything, she just squats and goes. It's completely healthy-looking urine, no blood or cloudiness or anything, and she doesn't seem to be in pain so I doubt it's a U.T.I. I also doubt she's incontinent because she doesn't pee in her sleep.

I don't think it's psychological either. She doesn't really seem nervous when she urinates on the floor and while she sometimes does it while excited, I doubt being excited is a necessary condition because she pees on the floor plenty of times when not excited. There is no apparent pattern, it's just random; she seems to be past the ""peeing thirty seconds after drinking"" stage, too.

So why do you think she urinates on the floor and how do we stop it (we're already taking her out heaps of times)?"

774,How do I get my dog to stop barking. [Help],dogs,t3_a82xmi,3,False,False,a82xmi,"Hello, this is my first time posting on this sub, so if this should instead be moved to another subreddit, lmk. Also very long so tl;dr at the bottom. 

So in our family, we have had 3 small dogs at different times. Our oldest, a Yorkie terrier, has been with us for 12 years and is extremely sweet. Around 5 years ago, we got 2 other dogs, both Pekingese. We gave 1 to a family member, and kept the other as a gift for our kids. The Yorkie has always been extremely friendly, and didn’t mind the new member, while the Pekingese has always been very docile, so was fine living with the Yorkie. After being with us for 4 years, someone broke into our backyard and took our Pekingese while my family slept. Our Yorkie has always been very fast and agile, so he wasn’t taken, but the Pekingese, being very docile, was probably taken without much resistance. 

Fast forward to the next day, our kids were heartbroken, because their dog was gone, and were very distraught. Both dogs were chipped, but after several weeks of making signs and calling local shelters to no avail, we gave up. Very quickly we decided to get another dog, and we adopted from a friend a Pomeranian. 

This Pomeranian was a puppy, only around 6 weeks old, and was never very aggressive towards our Yorkie, as our Yorkie wasn’t aggressive towards it. While raising it, I was the primary caregiver; bathing, feeding, and taking this dog for walks. While on walks, he was never aggressive towards dogs we encountered, simple looking at it and continuing walking. 

During the next few months, we’ve had several parties, and during some parties we had a recurring guest who liked to bring her dog as well. Whenever that dog was near our Pomeranian, our Pomeranian would bark NON-STOP. Never getting near it, but continuously barking at it from a few feet away. That other dog is was very friendly as well, not barking back or going near it, but our dogs constant barking was annoying, so we simply separated them and that was it. This happened a couple times afterwards, but we did the same thing. 

Now, fast forward a couple more months, approximately 6 months since our dog was stolen, to this week, and we get a call from the next town over, saying they have our dog. We rush over the next day, and our Pekingese is there, a little fatter then he left us, but it was him. Our kids were ecstatic about this news, as was I. On the drive home, in the back of my mind, I had the thought of how the Pomeranian was going to handle the new dog, and became a bit worried.

Upon coming home, the Pekingese was very happy, wagging its tail and running around, obviously overjoyed to be back home. I was the only one home, so I brought him to the backyard where the other dogs were, and let the inside. I held the Pekingese in my lap and sat down. Letting the other dogs smell him. The Yorkie remembered him, and reacted happy and went about his day. But the Pomeranian smelled him for about 5 seconds, and began barking loudly. 

The Pekingese smelled him and looked at him, but aside from that, more or less ignored the Pomeranian. I had work to do at my desk here at home, so I left them inside and began to work. For the rest of the day, the Pomeranian would NOT STOP BARKING. It would bark for and hour, take a 5 minute break doing something, then look at the other dog, the begin barking again. I got tired of it and put the Pomeranian outside and let the Yorkie and Pekingese stay inside. At night, I put them all outside, fed them in separate bowls, and stayed outside to make sure nothing happened. They all ate their food, but after the Pomeranian finished eating, he began his barking again. They sleep inside, so I had to have them sleep in different rooms for the night, because the Pomeranian wouldn’t stop growling and barking. This proceeded for the next 2 days, with me trying different things I read online, like taking them for walks together and just trying to let them get used to each others smells, but to no avail.

During this, the Pomeranian wouldn’t do anything but bark, while the Pekingese wouldn’t do anything to retaliate. Finally, the Pomeranian started to nip  at the Pekingese’s legs or face, and the Pekingese started to bite and bark back. This has been happening for the last day or so. So my request for you guys is if there is any other ways that we may get the Pomeranian to stop being aggressive towards the Pekingese, or at least to stop barking, because I am getting very close to just buying a muzzle. I can’t stay home all day and keep them separated, nor can I leave them alone in the backyard in fear of them hurting one another. 

tl;dr One of our dogs was stolen and we got another dog to replace him. After 6 months, our old dog showed up, but the replacement dog is extremely aggressive towards the old dog and won’t stop barking and fighting. What do I do?

For most of my adult life we’ve lived across the country. I visited for the first time yesterday and am lost for words. My mother has basically been letting her dogs use the bathroom inside. On the carpet. She shampoos the “trouble areas”, where they piss regularly, everyday she says. I think it’s more like once a month. 

I don’t have any other options especially considered we’ve made plans for me to move in. I’ve already spoken with a professional carpet cleaning company to start cleaning the carpets regularly for the smell. 

These are two older dogs. Probably about 7 and 10, both chihuahuas. How do I house train these dogs in an environment they are used to shitting and pissing in? I need help. ): "
779,[Breeds] Which dog is right for me?,dogs,t3_a85rev,2,False,False,a85rev,"Hey Reddit - My girlfriend and I will be looking to add a dog to our lives and we wanted your opinions on different breeds. We have been talking with a couple breeders (various breeds) but before we got too far into the relationship with a certain breeder, I wanted to post here and see what you all thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Introduction\*\*  
1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\* No. I grew up with a weimaraner and have trained a standard poodle. My girlfriend grew up with 3 small to medium mutts.   
2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
\* Preferably breeder but open to a young rescue.  
3) Describe your ideal dog.  
\* We would like a dog that can keep up with us on weekend hikes, and one that is also a good running companion for myself (triathlete). We would also like a dog that has an “off switch” when it is time to relax. A dog who is historically loving/sociable/friendly to its owners and with others as well.  
4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* We are looking at GSPs, Weim’s, Dalmatians, Aussies, Rhodesian Ridgebacks. (I know all of these dogs besides the sporting ones have much different temperaments and needs, but just giving you all a wide scope of what we have looked at)

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\* Besides the basic commands: Off leash, running on a leash with me (canicross type stuff). Potential dog sports  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
\* On average we can spend 1.5 to 2 hours a day exercising. When the pup is old enough he or she will also be my running companion (up to 30mpw). Can also bike the dog. We live close to a dog park and can go there 3-4 times a week. Hiking on the weekends.   
8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\* I am open to doing some but would rather not have to deal with it too much.   
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
9) What size dog are you looking for?  
\* 45-75lbs  
10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\* Shedding: Alot is okay, not a dealbreaker. Barking: If someone breaks in I want the dog to bark, other than that stay relatively quiet. Slobber: Minimal.   
11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\* Very  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* No. I want a dog that is very playful with other dogs.   
16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
\* My girlfriend prefers a large snuggly dog. Wants to feel comfortable walking with the dog at night. The involvement will be just about 50/50 except most of the exercise will come from me. Olive (our 1 year old kitten) would love a play partner and snuggle buddy as well.

780,[Discussion] What do you do when someone says they want a designer dog?,dogs,t3_a7znr0,152,False,False,a7znr0,"My future brother-in-law recently moved into a small townhome with his other brother. He's a major dog lover, so we've been talking to him a lot about our soon-to-be-puppy (picking up our golden retriever in 3 weeks!). He mentioned he hopes to get a dog in the spring, and that he's looking to get a mini goldendoodle or mini australian labradoodle because of the size and no shedding. 

What do you say in these instances? Do you just let people be ignorant and support BYB? Do you call them out on it and try to tell them why they shouldn't? The situation is a bit tricky because their family dog is a goldendoodle and they love her, so having to tell them that they shouldn't support designer dogs would probably be seen as an attack on their current beloved dog. What would you do?"

After the holidays I will be spending another 6 months here but will be going home for other various reasons for a few days at a time. Im wondering, for his sake, whether or not it would be a good or bad idea for me to see my dog during those times. Would it be detrimental to his mental and emotional wellbeing for us to be reunited after so long only to leave again? Or would it be better to not see him until I am able to take him home for good?

So I have my beautyful baby Maxxie. His dad is a Rottweiler, and his mom a blue Pittbull.
Maxxie is 3, almost 4 years old. We recieved him as a gift from his parents owner. We didn't plan to have a dog, but soon the little one stole our hearts.
He grew up healthy and happy. The vet checked him up for vaccines and stuff. 
He was pretty normal untill about 20 month ago slowly some weird sores appered in his paws. The vet told us that it was due to walking on heat surfaces, but we only walked him at nigh.  Anyways, the walks were suspended. He recovered with some antibacterial spray the vet gave us. 
He took month but he was healthy again. Then about 14 months ago he developed some weird bald patches in his back. The patches soon became small sores covered in what I though it was fat or oil. Another trip to the vet reveled it was some infection. He gave us some antibiotic and then steroids. That only worked for a while. Then the vet suggested too much fat on Maxxies diet. So we switched onto another brand of dog food. That didn't work.
Antibiotic soap baths? Done. 
So we tried a second opinion. Was Maxxie allergic to pollen? Leaves? Fabric softener? Even tap water?  We stopped the walking again, washed all his clothes, only feed him bottled water and specific food. Nothing.
Im so sad right now. Seeing my poor baby like this. The sores started bleeding. He bites himself and make it worst. 
Third vet opinion: maybe he has fleas. No he doesn't but anyways we bought some liquid to prevent fleas. 
I don't know what else to do. Please, please help.
I would like to post some pictures but it might be too graphic. "

Background: I moved over the weekend and I’m crashing in my parents’ basement for the next few weeks until my new lease starts. I also started a new job on Monday so my dogs have to stay at home all day. At my last job, they came to work with me and sat under my desk all day every day, I could take them out as much as they wanted and they could play with the other office dogs all day. So naturally they are a little freaked out about all of the sudden changes happening all at once, moving out of their house, in a new place without their mom 40+ hours a week.

Any tips on getting them to stop having potty accidents in my parents’ basement? I have a potty pad out and they blatantly ignore it, popping a squat on the carpet a few feet away from it. 

Also wondering if maybe my girl dog has a UTI? She is peeing two huge pees in the middle of the night when she normally would go all night without having to go to the bathroom. When I take her on walks she stops every 10 feet to pee and nothing comes out (obviously after she emptied her bladder first time she popped a squat). Help!

Potty schedule: 

7am our for a quick pee
7:30-8 long walk for pee/poo
Noon: my dad take them on a walk
Late afternoon: my dad lets them out in the backyard to go pee
7ish home from work: we go on a quick 15 min walk
Bedtime: pee break before bed

This is more than enough potty breaks, so how do I get them to stop peeing?

792,[Breeds] - Please recommend a breed for me,dogs,t3_a7zd22,18,False,False,a7zd22,"**Introduction**

* Rescue

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

 My ideal dog would possess the following traits:

* Relatively small and quiet breed (I live alone in a 2 bedroom apartment)

- Calm demeanor, somewhat lower-medium energy level. I don't have the right type of space for a hyper dog, but I'd still like a dog that will have enough energy to go out on hikes if possible.
- Will travel well, as I spend a lot of time traveling back and forth to my GF's place
- Low prey drive (GF has two cats)
 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I don't really have too much of a preference, but I've never liked beagles, schnauzers, or other curly-haired dogs. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands, and to stay with me off-leash.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I mostly work from home, so I have a lot of time to interact with the dog

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Same as above, I am home almost every day, and have a dog park on-site, and can generally spend as much time exercising the dog each day as it needs. I do live in the northeast, so heavy snow can affect my ability to provide exercise for short periods of time. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'd likely pay a professional to do this, so a dog that requires less grooming is preferred.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Something less than 50lbs

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I can tolerate, but the less barking the better (apartment), and not a big fan of slobbering dogs.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Fairly important. There is a dog park at my apartment, and I'd like for the dog to be able to interact off-leash. I also do a lot of hiking, and would definitely enjoy having the ability to have the dog off-leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Somewhere in the middle

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I'm fine with a dog barking at a door knock, but I would like a dog that will warm up to visitors quickly

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. The rules of my apartment do not allow any dogs that are aggressive.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I think I've covered them

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone, but when visiting my girlfriend she only requires that the dog doesn't eat her cats.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* I don't have kids, so no. If I brought the dog to work, it would interact with kids often, but that's not a requirement.

793,[Help] Food changes after life changes?,dogs,t3_a82fdd,1,False,False,a82fdd,"I have a 7 year old female Beagle. She's always been a chow hound - will take as much food as you'll give. Because of this, I've broken her feedings between two meals a day.

I give her half a cup (not an actual Cup, just the cup I use to draw food from the bag) in the morning before I leave, and half a cup in the afternoon when I get home.

She's always devoured her food as soon as I've set it down.

Until last week. Last Thursday I took in a coworker who was about to be homeless and I'm letting him crash on my reading/coffee room's couch for a while. I try to keep her out of that room because she's been known to pull some books and decoratives off of low shelves, and I have some expensive editions, collectables, and such in there, alongside my (religious) altar.

So when my guest is staying in that room, we keep the door closed. She's spent some time around him, however, and they've become quick friends, she lets him pet her and is generally welcoming of him in 'her domain'. But she has seemed a little more alert, and she's spent a good deal of time watching that closed door.

However, she's been eating much less since he came. When I feed her in the morning, I've been coming back to an untouched or half-eaten bowl, and she'll eat the rest later on, without prompting me for more, like she sometimes does by pawing the bowl- which she normally does when I get home and don't feed her immediately.

Any ideas? Thanks!"

798,[Help] Rough first fostering experience. Am I asking too much?,dogs,t3_a7z7aj,9,False,False,a7z7aj,"This is a little long, so TLDR: My SO and I are finishing up fostering a dog for the first time, and it's been a nightmare. Are we being crazy and expecting too much from the foster organization?

SO: My partner and I have been wanting a dog for ages, and we finally moved into a place with a nice backyard and a reasonable pet deposit. We were a little nervous about going full commitment to a dog, so when an opportunity came up to foster a ~1 year old beagle mix it seemed like a great idea.

From the start, though, it has just been an incredibly stressful and un-fun experience. We work opposite schedules generally, and there are only 2-3 days a week where the dog would need to be crated for at most 8 hours (we are sometimes able to come back for a walk at lunch, but not always). We were told by the rescue that the dog's previous foster worked similar hours so it would not be an issue. From the start, however, whenever we left her alone she would be obviously stressed out and break out of her crate. The rescue gave us some info on crate training but after a few weeks of that there was no improvement and the dog was getting even more stressed out. It is also worth noting that the dog only had these problems when we left, otherwise she was perfectly content to sleep in her crate and went in voluntarily very often. She howls incessantly during the day, according to our neighbor. When the rescue got us a gate and suggested we try gating her in a room, she tore down the sturdy gate. She has scratched the hell out of exit doors in our house (the front/back doors she sees us walk out of).

Some of the chaos she's caused when alone is just inexperience. Every time we come home and find something chewed up, it's a new lesson in puppy-proofing the house, and that's fine and to be expected. But the rescue kept blowing off the clear symptoms (not necessarily officially diagnosable behavior) of separation anxiety. We understand that many rescue dogs go through a decompression phase and that the amount of time can vary drastically, but this dog is incredibly stressed out when left alone and even if it is a temporary problem, she deserves help getting through it. We are more than happy to help her but we have never done this before and need help ourselves as we do not know how to approach the problem. Our inexperience and need for help should any issues arise was made abundantly clear when we were asked to foster (the president of the rescue asked us to help out, which we were happy to do since we were considering it anyway). No matter how much we asked for help, we rarely get an answer.

We had previously looked at adopting an adorable malamute mix with separation anxiety, and decided against it because we thought our first dog having anxiety issues would be a bad idea as we were not confident about our ability to properly handle it without any experience. Again, I totally get that it's way too early to diagnose anything, but after weeks of dealing with howling and scratching and chewing and getting silence, if anything, from the rescue I was ready to go insane.

It really just comes down to the lack of communication - and this is where my main question is. What sort of help do you expect from a rescue organization when fostering a dog from them? I know they're probably dealing with a million other things and may not have time to walk a pair of panicking first-time foster parents through how to handle anxiety symptoms, but I feel like we were crazy for asking for help so many times. We had larger problems getting things they said they would provide for us - a lead for our backyard, harness to help with her pulling, some more durable chew toys - but again I have no idea if those are things a rescue will typically provide or if they're supposed to come out of our pocket. The rescue told us they would be providing anything we needed but the only things they have actually delivered on are a gate and food.

Are we crazy and needy? Was it just a shitty situation, having two people who couldn't have someone home at all times handling a dog who hated being alone?"

800,[Breeds] Whippet vs. Border Terrier,dogs,t3_a83nyt,8,False,False,a83nyt,"Hello r/dogs! I’d appreciate some advice on picking the right breed for my partner and I. I filled out the breed questionnaire a few days ago but only got one response. I’m on mobile otherwise I would have copied and pasted.

After a lot of research and lengthy discussion, my partner and I think that either a Whippet or a Border Terrier might be right for us. We’d love to hear some opinions about these two breeds with regard to our lifestyle. In summary - we are a moderately active couple living in a one bedroom apartment. We have multiple parks around us and enjoy revolving our life around our dog! I go into a lot more detail in the breed questionnaire.

We keep tossing up between the two (very different!) breeds. We don’t want to start contacting breeders before we are absolutely sure on the breed we would like. In saying that, registered Whippet breeders are a LOT more common in Australia (100+ Whippet breeders vs. &lt;40 Border Terrier breeders). But that shouldn’t be the deciding factor.

I’d love to hear your thoughts if you have had experience with either breed, or if you have any other breed suggestions we are very open to hearing them. You should be able to find all the information that you need in the breed questionnaire (my post history), but feel free to ask further questions. Thanks in advance!"

802,[Discussion] How Frequently Does A Cattle Dog Puppy Need Care?,dogs,t3_a7zx3m,3,False,False,a7zx3m,"3 years ago I had IT admin job where I worked from home. I was able to get a Cattle Dog puppy and raise him and give him training and play myself multiple times during the day. It was cool how he even as an adult he would still try and sit in my lap like he did as a puppy, even though he grew to 70 lbs. Unfortunately he was attacked unprovoked and killed by a pitbull off it's leash 2 months ago.

I really miss him and would like to get another puppy, but I work in an office now so I can't be home to let him out every few hours. I can look for another job that works remotely, but was curious what the recommendations are for how often they need interaction during the day.

Also, is getting an older puppy an option? I got my last puppy right at 6 weeks, but if I get one at 3-4 months does that affect thier bond with you as the owner at all?"

He has lived in the house with access to a backyard for 5 years and has never had to poop on a leash before. He is completely fine on walks and marks everywhere, walks are actually his favorite part of the day. However, no matter how often or how long I walk him, he will not poop while on a leash.


I just moved to an apartment complex so there is no way I can take him off. There's no dog park nearby that I can go to to let him loose, so I don't really know what to do at this point. He gets fed only at night and hopes that in the morning he'll have to go bad enough that he'll just go on our walks. When I was feeding him twice a day, he would poop on my rugs in the house while I was at work.  He has never once had an accident in the house before this, and I know that he feels really bad about it.


I'm kind of at a loss. I walk him 15 to 30 minutes per walk and about 5 walks a day. We go all over the complex, even to the parts where it's mainly trees and no people or cars are around. His recall is 50/50 so I don't feel comfortable taking him off. I've tried a regular leash and am now using an extendable (I know everyone hates these, pls just spare me) in hopes that he feels less ""forced"" to be near me.


Does anyone have any advice? He feels bad. I feel bad. We all feel bad. Thank you. "

812,[Fluff] Love your dogs (And/Or your cats... I guess... ;) ),dogs,t3_a7ueeg,1,False,False,a7ueeg,"2016 was without a doubt the worst year of my life. I nearly lost my Mum to Cancer. End of a 10 year relationship. ""Homeless"" for a moment (Not truely. I was in a hostel, so thankful for that). And June that year marked the start of a 19 month saga whereby my ex did some shady things and essentially stole my dogs. 

It cost me $10,000 in legal fees to get them back. But worse, it cost me 19 months without my two beloved rescues, in a deep pit of depression. That's all I want to say about that (unless anyone wants to ask me stuff. I'm an open book).

But in March this year, I got them back. My Lab, and my Husky are home. I have legal bills to pay, and I'm ""behind in life"" because of the stress and anxiety of that situation and the time I devoted to fighting for them.

But they're home. You can forget about everything sad I just told you. That's why this is [Fluff]. My dogs fixed me. They are my world. The worst days I'll have going forward won't be half as bad as they would have been without them. They are the joy of my life.

I know if you're on this thread, there's a good chance you feel the same way. But promise me you'll never neglect them. Never take them for granted. Never look at them as a burden. They'll never ask for more from you then food and love. 

As bad as my situation was (and it was bad), I consider myself to be the luckiest person in the world. My dogs were taken from me. It was as if they were dead, but then I got them back. Very few people can call themselves that lucky.

I had a few good friends who lost their dogs this year. And I'm sure that's happened to many of you this year, or in the past as well. And if you have a pet, it will happen in the future. There's no softening that blow. So to anyone who is going through that loss, or know what it feels like, I wish you well, especially at this time of the year.

If you're near a dog right now, hug it for me, and for yourself. :) I am."
813,"[Discussion] If your dog has unexplained seizures, check his/her dog food for Rosemary extract",dogs,t3_a7kg4q,242,False,False,a7kg4q,"Both of my dogs were on a diet of Blue Buffalo kibble. My youngest started having grand mal seizures around 1.5 years old. I took him to the vet and they concluded that he has epilepsy. They wanted to put him on medication for it, but I knew that the meds had bad side effects. 

His seizures were still coming pretty far apart and never more than 30 seconds so I did some research and found that spices like rosemary, sage, and fennel could trigger seizures. Lo’ and behold, all the Blue Buffalo kibble and treats had rosemary extract in the ingredients list. 

I started looking for a kibble that didn’t contain rosemary, which is surprisingly difficult! I’d say 95% of the kibbles I researched contained rosemary. Taste of the Wild doesn’t, however, and since I’ve been feeding him that, he hasn’t had a single seizure. We’re just about a year seizure-free! 

Edit: I’m not trying to pretend to be a scientist and say that rosemary is definitely the cause of your dog’s seizures. I know this is anecdotal, but it’s something that’s worked for me, and rosemary is a trigger in some dogs. It may not end your dog’s seizures, but it’s an option to look into. "

I just feel like this is political and the dogs should not be suffering because of it.

Basically the city is saying its a liability to have them there when they lost their non-profit status by the state...

Shelter: ""Figueroa, who became director of FOCAS in October, said she was the one who notified the city about the nonprofit’s Franchise Tax Board violation. According to Figueroa, the former FOCAS head did not file taxes in 2014 because the organization did not open a bank account or receive nonprofit status until 2015.
She says the problem is expected to be rectified soon, and that she has offered to work as a volunteer to care for the dogs during the 90-day deadline issued by the city, but officials have so far declined that offer.""

City official:  ""The city gives $2,500 a month to FOCAS and owns the Second Street building that is home to the shelter, but when government officials were notified the nonprofit is suspended by the state, it became a liability for Orange Cove, said Mayor Victor Lopez.""

“They are in violation and the council had to take action. Somebody’s got to be held accountable for not reporting those funds that were given to them,” Lopez said.""


Please follow the link below to sign the petition to at least allow the volunteers who know and love these animals to be allowed to care for them again.


Update: The paperwork has been sorted on the tax issue as of yesterday morning 7am. They had an email sent to the city and the city is saying they can't accept an email.

The shelter said it would be posted by Friday morning but the city's response was that they can schedule them for the next city council meeting in JANUARY.

There are people who are genuinely mean inside and I'm wondering if dogs experience the same to varying degrees?

I might be anthropomorphizing. I have a Shiba who's been pretty stereotypical of an aloof and independent Shiba. I know we're not supposed to call our dogs jerks but he really is sometimes. One time when he was much younger, I made a horrible training mistake where I was giving him frozen peanut butter kongs to eat while crated to help him adjust to being crated. The mistake was me taking his kong away before he was done because I put so much PB in there and through some trust/exchange exercises, he lets me take his treat without growling at me. 

When this was happening, he had this weird look in his eye, like an upward angry warning glare right before he would growl. The closest I can compare it to is like a wolf stalking its prey? 

Lately I've been training him to stay out of the kitchen because he's been pushing his boundaries and whenever I tell him no, he gives me the same kind of glare instead of his usual puppy eyes. I don't know if I'm uncomfortable because I was so shocked that he snapped/growled at me the first time. My husband says he senses weakness (I spoil him). I keep worrying that he's just not a ""nice"" dog? Maybe I'm totally off base and crazy."

The past 2 years she has been suffering from kidney failure and a progressing heart murmur. It's long beem to the point where she's needing a diaper 24/7. Of course, her personality still showed, until I went away to college. She started sleeping more and more and eating less and less, up until these past 2 weeks where she stopped eating entirely. I feel personally responsible because I left. I feel as though I caused her to give up. 

I'm also worried about our other poodle who was raised by Scully. Scully was a breeding dog before we adopted her and she came packed with motherly instincts. Our toy poodle, Zoe, was adopted so she could have a puppy to raise. I'm worried Zoe is going to become heartbroken. I know I certainly am.

823,"[Fluff] As a first time dog owner, I just feel I need to share.",dogs,t3_a7z19z,3,False,False,a7z19z,"Hi r/dogs! Just after moving in to our new apartment, my gf and I adopted two 8-month old mutt sisters, Mari and Juca. I know a lot of posts here by new dog-owners are all about puppy regret, so I was kind of ready for that. Luckily, in the week or so we've had them, I have been feeling nothing of the sort, at least yet! I love them, cuddle with them, and don't mind their doggy smell, picking up their poo, or, you know, not having a life anymore, which were some of the stuff I feared I would not adapt to. :) Still, I would like to share some concerns and questions, more to know if these things are normal and hear other's experiences, either to reassure me or to tell if I'm doing anything wrong. I have been all over r/pups101 and youtube for a long time leading up to this, but of course practice is harder than theory.

1) Potty training is hard! Right now I'm on vacation and so can focus entirely on them, but there will be days when me and my gf will both be working long hours and will only be able to walk them once a day. So, when they *must* go at home, I would like them to go on the newspaper in a designated area in the laundry/kitchen area. The problem is they sort of elected the middle of the living room as their preferred spot for pooping! Everywhere I look on the internet, people tell me to praise them and give treats when they do the right thing, but how can I do that when they have not once pooped in the right place? When walking them, they are inconsistent. Sometimes they poop, sometimes not, sometimes in the morning, some in the evening. Everytime, I praise and give treats, but just this morning Juca didn't poop even after 24h since last time, and after eating (and I walked 1h30), so I'm just sitting at home vigilantly watching her. I know she will go in the living room but I'm not sure what to do if I catch her in the act. Is all this normal and will it come with time, or can it go on like this for ever?

2) As this subreddit seems very US-centered, please bear in mind that, culturally, people differ greatly in their attitudes to dogs. Where I live, while people adore their dogs, crating dogs is virtually unheard of. We are keeping them at night locked in the kitchen/laundry area (and also when home alone), and just this is almost shocking to my gf (who is a native). So crate training is out of the question...

3) I know adopting siblings is a bad idea. But I did not know it at the time. Again, these are basically rescue dogs, so the people previously in charge of them have no knowledge of such subtelties, they think it's extra cute that they are sisters, and would not give them away separated. I still did not need to separate them, and so have been walking them together (with zero previous experience), so it has been fun as you can imagine! Again, culture here is more laid back about these things.

4) RIP shoes? Is that the long and short of it? What do people do in practice? Simply never leave shoes where they can reach them, or is there another way?

5) Hobbies. I like to paint in my free time. Can anyone maintain a hobby owning dogs?

These are my experiences so far! Any input is appreciated, and sorry for the wall of text."

Prefer a reputable breeder. Where I'm located, (Oregon), there seems to be a bit of a shortage of pets, as there really aren't a whole lot of rescues that I have found near me. If anyone from Oregon has a few recommendations other than the Humane Society, i'd love to hear them!

1. **Describe your ideal dog.**

Looking for a loving, medium dog. I feel that it's a vane request, but I really (obviously) love beautiful, athletic dogs like the border collie and Australian shepherd. My preference is a high life expectancy, few medical issues and above all very intelligent.

1. **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I absolutely love Border Collies, Australian Shepherds and similar due to their insane intelligence, loyalty and the millions of posts of ""man's best friend"" regarding these breeds. I'm not a huge fan of labs and golden retrievers, as many of my friends have a few younger purebreds that are extremely lovable but beyond wild, which i'm sure comes with the fact that they're younger and not super well trained. Additionally, another friend has a German Shorthair and Brittany which are hunting dogs, whom are both super loving and friendly, and their temperament is spot on with being laid back and relaxed, but they're almost too open to other people and not super ""loyal"" to their owner. They are VERY well trained. Kind of looking for a middle ground between ""active and hyper"" and ""laid back and loyal"".

I have heard mixed reports about JUST HOW MUCH exercise working dogs need, as from personal experience two of my friends have Aussie shepherds that are super happy with simply good, long walks. With this in mind, I'm 100% open to recommendations of other breeds, and criticism/ideas, or tips if I were to go this route.

1. **What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Looking to do the basic stuff, heel, sit, stay, lay down, go, fetch etc etc but really would love to play with expanding on additional stuff too. My main goal is to have a dog that is extremely responsive of those commands, rather than knowing 3 million different commands.

**Care Commitments**

6.	**How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

About 2 hours per day of exercise, i'd imagine. Give or take an hour or so for sure. There would be constant companionship though, when i'm home in the morning and back mid-day.

**7.	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

Probably about 2 hours a day. Have a large yard and a park across the street. We have a local dog park, but i've never personally been to it. We also have pretty much immediate access to multiple forests and a very very large community park attached to another large community park, so there's definitely places to walk/hike, play fetch and socialize.

**8.	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

Preferably no home cleaning (ears, etc) but we did pay for a professional groomer. If it's occasional/daily brushing along with the groomer, there's no issue there.

**Personal Preferences**

9.	**What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium would probably be the preference, 40-80 pounds.

**10.	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Preferably no slobber, but a bit of shedding and barking isn't a huge issue.

**11.	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

Fairly important. Not a deal breaker, but would for sure be nice for walks around the neighborhood

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12.	**Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Snuggly for sure.

**13.	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

Eager-to-please is a big upside, but independence would not be a bad thing either.

**14.	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

Protection is not a huge deal where I live, but interactions with strangers and visitors should be positive rather than aggressive.

**15.	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

I'm willing to manage, as our last dog was confrontational towards bigger dogs when he was younger, but began being more receptive once we were able to socialize him more. Unopposed either way, but the dog would be alone in the home w/o another pooch so that is something to keep in mind.

**16.	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Not particularly. Licking always pisses me off.

**Lifestyle**

**17.	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Generally about 4 hours a day, give or take.

**18.	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

**19.	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

We do have a (gecko? idk) smaller lizard in one of our rooms, but it's behind a locked door in a glass enclosure.

**20.	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Not in the family, neighbors do have children though. Will always be supervised.

**21.	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

No

**22.	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

Portland, OR.

No.

**23.	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

Generally about \~35-40 in the winter and \~70-80 in the summer, with obvious outliers. Can get up to 100 and down to 20ish, but is rare.

**Additional Information and Questions**

**24.	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

Do go back and forth between a second house every few days for a day or two which has a family member with a dog allergy, so while the residual hairs are not an issue if they shed, bringing the dog with for a few days is not an option. With this in mind, wife/kids would for sure take care of the dog while i'd be gone."
828,[HELP] dog ate chocolate,dogs,t3_a7vrsn,7,False,False,a7vrsn,"So not my dog but my cousins dog, she has a 7yr old female Pom she’s 10lbs  and yesterday she ate a whole box of chocolates. The timeline is sort of unclear but we took her to emergency services and it had been about 4hours since consumption. She had thrown up all over the house and in the car on the way to the pet hospital. The bill for emergency services was really high so my cousin opted out of over night care and paid for immediate intervention so they gave the dog charcoal and some injections , one to stop the vomiting and an antibiotic. 
So she took her home,and she says the dog is doing better but I don’t know I have this really bad feeling. 
I kind of just want to tell her to let me take her to my vet and get her checked out once more to really make sure she’s okay but I doubt she’ll accept. 
My question is if anyone’s ever been in a situation like this where your pup ate chocolate and what happened next.

831,[Help] My dog has basically stopped eating the past 2 days.,dogs,t3_a7uq9l,4,False,False,a7uq9l,"Hello r/dogs,

I have a little monster of a Maltese-Shih Tzu  that I love more than anything; he has always been a fussy eater (won't eat certain dog foods, loves certain brands for a period of time then won't go near it) but now it's come to the point where he hasn't eaten anything but a pork chop I cooked for him yesterday morning.

My dog has a process when it comes to eating. He will stare at me as I chop up his meat and put it in his bowl, and then stare at said meat for a period of time, probably making sure none of my 4 cats are hovering around, but he knows they stay well away from his food. 
My dog will then pick up a piece of meat and either run to the couch and smash it back, or run outside and hide it for later use. I'm not sure if this behavior formed when he was a puppy and had a large litter of brothers and sisters to compete with, or he is just a fussy little thing. Since I moved in and met this dog (just over a year) he has adapted to eating in the morning when I'm around, and again very late at night when I'm home from work because he knows he will get a Shmacko when he finishes his meal.

A friend with a girl dog has asked if we could try and mate our dogs. He met her a few days ago, and to say the least, he's smitten. Since he's met her, all he's eaten is the pork chop that I hand-fed him twice yesterday.
I don't know if this event has caused him to stop eating, or maybe something to do with my Guinea pig giving birth a few days ago. Or maybe he is on strike to demonstrate expensive raw meat is the new way to go.

I will be going to the vet tomorrow and talking about some kind of anti-anxiety pills and hope she has some idea of what is going on.
I am sorry for the wall of text, I get off track sometimes, but I was hoping some people have had this issue with their dogs and have any advice.
Thanks"
832,[Discussion] Breeder Interview,dogs,t3_a7uhhp,6,False,False,a7uhhp,"I have been looking at getting a corgi for the past 6-8 and finally contacted a reputable breeder in my area. I may not have time in the next couple weeks to visit, but they encouraged me to call to schedule an interview at their kennel.

I assume this is common practice for a reputable breeder to get to know the individual (although I did sent a really thoughtful email introducing myself, and included information like my job, hours, lifestyle, housing situation, nearby family, etc which I thought would be very helpful).

I am just wondering what the common breeder interview entails, what should I be expecting before driving about an hour away to visit them?

Thanks!"

834,[Fluff] So very thankful my puppy is alive and well—being a new dog mom is a rollercoaster!,dogs,t3_a7p3l2,4,False,False,a7p3l2,"I’ve always grown up with family dogs but those puppers chose other members of the family as their “hooman” so to speak. For example, our last family dog (English bulldog) really bonded and preferred my mom. 

After our bulldog, Max, went over the rainbow bridge some 5 years ago our family was open to having another family dog. 

Eventually Bam Bam, a 5 month old shih tzu, chose us. I immediately felt a close bond with him, unlike our other beloved dogs, and just chalked it up to the new puppy smell and puppy dog eyes. 

But over the past month we’ve had him in our home, I have spent the most time with him because the rest of my family have busier schedules. My mother has since deemed Bam Bam as my fur baby and I’m now his dog mom. 

Last night when I took him out to go potty, I noticed that he had something in his mouth. It looked like a weird old vegetable peel or maybe even a mushroom. 

I panicked since mushroom poisoning in dogs is very serious and something to watch out for. I asked everyone if they thought it was a mushroom but it was hard to tell. My sister and I looked up as much as we can regarding the different poisonous strains. My parents and my sister reassured me that none of them looked like that thing in his mouth. We made a plan to observe him for the next couple hours and rush him to the vet as soon as we noticed something was up. 

I felt sick to my stomach the entire night. I kept thinking I should have done a better job at keeping an eye on him. We crate train him, but I decided to let him sleep on my bed to make sure he didn’t have and delayed symptoms. I kept waking up to check on him. 

Over 15 hours have passed and so far my dog is as normal and snuggly as can be. He was probably confused why I was so anxious last night. I realize now that I may have overreacted but I can’t help but feel extremely grateful that he’s with us and chose me as his human. 

tl:dr I’m the primary caretaker of our puppy and I thought he had eaten a poisonous mushroom when I took him out last night. He hasn’t shown any symptoms and I may have overreacted. But I’m extremely glad he’s ok.

836,[Help] Good Supplements for old dog joints.,dogs,t3_a7tznt,9,False,False,a7tznt,"So my Lab is 10, and still in good health, and pretty mobile. Walks at full speed and can get up to a good medium pace in the park for short amounts of time.

He used to weigh 50kg before I rescued him, and it took a toll on his back hips. He lost most of that weight but is putting a bit back on just due to being a bit less active because he's a bit older and slower.

I've got him on some weight control food to help with that, and walking him lots, and it's getting better. (Unfortunately, budget reasons right now are preventing me from getting him premium food, or a completely raw diet, but he does get lots of bones and veggies etc). And over the next few months I'll be really looking for a great diet for BOTH my dogs.

I have a 7yo active husky (who also happens to be a fussy eater), and the lab above. So their requirements are a bit different. SO, keeping budget in mind a little bit, but without resorting to low grade shit...

1. Can you suggest a good diet that works for both?

2. If not, can you suggest a diet for each?

3. Can you suggest some great supplements for my lab in particular, to help him move a bit more freely (he doesn't have hip problems. Just old creaky joints). 

4. My Husky is in perfect health but is also getting to an age where I want to start preparing for her retirement years. So good supplements for her as well. One that would work for both dogs would be perfect."
837,"[Help] Dog toys that keep dogs super interested, and last.",dogs,t3_a7twdg,5,False,False,a7twdg,"Hey guys, TL;DR.... see above. :) (But if possible, be brand non specific, as I live in Australia so may not have the same range as you).

So basically, I have a 7 year old husky (energetic but knows how to relax :)) and a 10 year old Lab (pretty happy just chilling. :) ). They get on lead walks at least 3 days a week, and off lead park runs at least three times a week, and pretty often a road trip to a cool beach some place. That's a minimum of 6 days, but it's more when possible.

But I'm a freelance photographer/filmer. Some days I'm out on set, working, (No different to a 9-5 really). But when I'm not ""working"", I do all the other stuff I need to do (Marketing, retouching etc) from home.

I love this freedom because I get to spend a lot of time with my pups. I love to play with them, and I love spending as much time as I can with them. But...

Sometimes when I'm home with them, it's a ""work day"". I have to treat it like one, and that means ignoring them a bit, staring at a screen. Patting them if they come up to me (which I love), but generally they just lay down next to me. If I move to get a drink or use the bathroom, they get up and follow me like we're about to do something fun. Honestly, it feels bad, so quite often I take 30+ minutes to just be with them. But that adds up in terms of time not spent working, which actually leads to later nights and not being able to ""switch off"" at 5 because I didn't get enough done during the day.

So... I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for toys that will last a while (so I won't need to rebuy constantly), will keep them occupied, preferably won't result in too much mess (I live in a share house), and that they'll love, whether they're right next to me or alone for the day.

They do like to play together (tug of war with a rope for example), but they tend to do that almost for my amusement. :) They make sure I'm watching before they start. And as soon as one wins, the other is left with nothing to do.

Feel free to shout out some brand names, but I live in Australia so I'd rather hear about styles of toys if there's options, because I may not be able to get the brand you mention.

Oh, and it doesn't have to be a ""toy"" either. Tips welcome. But not food related. I often give them a bone to work on during the day, and Snickers (the lab) doesn't need any more food. :) (He disagrees).

Also, just to be clear... this is for their enjoyment, and for professional reasons. My Lotto dream is to quit everything and live on a beach with them and a supermodel who's also incredibly kind, intelligent, witty, funny, sweet and perfect for me, and me for her. (I won the lottery in this scenario remember? It's possible. But I'd take a regular woman who ticks all those other boxes too. :) So if that's you, feel free to hit me up... ;) )

842,[Help] Pain-Induced Aggression in Dog,dogs,t3_a7ui4p,2,False,False,a7ui4p,"Hello,

I have a 2 year old Corgi/Lab mix who has recently injured herself in her paw. It was a very deep laceration which caused a lot of bleeding and pain. My family and I took her to the vet where she was quite aggressive and nippy when they applied a bandage, and she is still very aggressive to us today. We can not approach her without growling or her trying to nip at us. She is very distrustful of anybody. This is especially problematic as she continues to chew on her bandage, preventing it from healing properly. We use a muzzle which helps calm her down and prevents her from biting, but is difficult to put on the dog, and becoming more difficult to put on overtime as she dislikes it. We also have a Elizabethan-style cone but it is a little short and our dog can still access her wound. 

The bandage is due to come off Saturday but this still has caused a lot of stress in my family. To give context - my dog has a history of resource-guarding with rawhide bones/treats and is excitable around strangers. I have been working on her around strangers and she is not ""aggressive""; rather just nips when she gets too excited. She is also very nervous around other dogs, especially when she is on a leash. She is better off leash around dogs but still distrustful. We bought her improperly using Kijiji and not analyzing her parents/her own behavior, but I really do not want to give up this dog from this bout of stress. 

Please reddit, how should I deal with this? I've been searching online but the only advice they give is to go to the vet and the pain will subside (which it obviously has not, even though she is on some painkillers). How do I prevent this behaviour in the future?

* What are the pros, cons, is it intimidating having your dog jump and latch onto your arm? 
* Did you do it for fun, did you compete?
* Is this something I can do with a still relatively young dog? (she just turned one year, but she was spayed super young so I don't want to do anything that will put too much pressure on her joints yet)
* What should I work on before starting the beginner's class?
* Is it all corrections-based? (this is something I will ask the clubs, but curious to see if the sport has moved toward a balanced approach)

I'm thinking about this, disc, or agility in the spring to start. She's a fairly confident dog, loves using her nose and her obedience training is going well. She's a shepherd mix, is pretty laid back, loves to use her mouth while we play, doesn't go over threshold unpredictably."
853,[Help] 1yr old Rottweiler refuses to put weight on rear leg.,dogs,t3_a7ujwa,17,False,False,a7ujwa,"**Edit: As I feared, it's her CCL. She'll be having a CORA Based Leveling Osteotomy in about a month (the surgeon is booked out). On the bright side, I'm in a place where I can afford the surgery, and it's winter so I won't feel too bad keeping her cooped up for recovery. It's her birthday today, so once her sedatives wear off, I'm going to make her a kibble cake with some bacon.

**I have already made an appointment with our vet for tomorrow**

I took my 1 year old, 95lb (yeah, I know she's bordering on too big for a girl, but she came from questionable origins) Rottweiler to the park today to finally enjoy the unseasonably warm (46F) weather. She went into heat over Thanksgiving, so we haven't been able to go for nearly a month. During that time we took a few walks and ran around the backyard and in the house, so while not as active as before (we would hit the park 3-5x per week, plus walks) she wasn't completely sedentary either.

 When we got there, we were the only ones so she was able to walk/trot around to check out the smells and warm up slowly. A short while later a young mastiff showed up to play, and they hit it off, lumbering around like big dogs will do. They played for a while, then each went off on their own to check things out. Soon my dog initiated play again, and as she was coming back from around the trees, she let out a little whine and raised her rear paw. I went to her to check it out. She let me move her leg, no reaction at the hip or knee, but didn't want me to check her feet. There was a dime sized drop of blood on the snow. She took a few steps, and would just touch the very tips of her toes to the ground.  I carried her (a ridiculous sight I'm sure, since I've only got her by 30lbs) to the entrance gates, ran to get the car, and took her home. 

Once home, she was very eager to get out of the car and into the yard. Still limping, but wanting to sniff around and mark her spots. Headed inside, she didn't let her sore leg slow her down going up the stairs. I got her to lie down and let me check her out. After an initial warning groan, she let me feel out her foot and I didn't find anything unusual. I gave her meal (appetite is as good as ever) and crated her. I've been taking her out every couple of hours to see how she moves. She is still reluctant to put any weight on the leg, but is determined to still get into things, climb onto the couch, and sneak bites of food from the bag. She will sit normally (sloppy puppy sit to either side), and is willing to lie on either side as well.  She just will not put her foot all the way on the ground. My late, smaller, Rottie was prescribed Piroxicam (an NSAID) for arthritis and cancer pain, so I gave her one to help her be comfortable for tonight. 

I guess what I'm wondering is, has anyone had any experience with similar symptoms? And what was the diagnosis?  I'm thinking maybe a CCL, though that wouldn't explain the drop of blood (I did find small, fresh scab on her neck, though, so the blood may be unrelated), or possibly an issue with her toe/toenail since she didn't want me poking around her feet. It's also possible I missed and injury between the toes.

TL;DR Young dog is limping, wondering what it could be. Will see vet first thing tomorrow."

860,"[help] Need help about a puppy in the care of someone maybe not worthy? Bad title, read in for details.",dogs,t3_a7trj1,5,False,False,a7trj1," 

Okay, I know this won't necessarily be the best place for this, and redirection to the best sub will be welcomed...

And please, helpful advice only... we're truly worried about this.

Story:  Our Golden Doodle girl had nine puppies, but while we are not breeders,  we did all we could to make sure they were healthy and as importantly;  that they went to good families.  We asked for a fair price, and  everyone paid accordingly... except one .. she asked us if we could  split as she was looking for a good puppy for her 8yo son, who has a  medical condition (won't specify) and needed a therapy type dog....  and  she was only shy $50.  We wrote up an agreement to have the other  portion paid by the end of this month (December).

We waited 18 days to send out one reminder text, as we wanted to wait long enough but also not annoy during the actual holidays.

My wife and her became friends on FB.

Tonight, we found out first that she had deleted her... and at first did not reply to my text.

That's a concern... but it's nothing compared to what we discovered next.

The  woman is now under investigation for 'allegedly accidentally' running  her child over in a school parking lot (caught on camera).  The boy is  currently in critical condition.  This happened 8 days ago.

She  did respond to my wife and said she had deleted a lot of people out of  embarrassment and don't believe everything you see or read.  She said  the puppy was with her daughter over at her Sister's house.  This  suggests that she had her other child removed from the home.  She has  sent further texts discussing getting our address for the $ and talked  about the puppy, but we are greatly concerned.

What we would like to get out of this is:

1. the  agreement was full payment by Dec 31st, or we have the right to reclaim  the puppy.  We don't expect to receive the $.  The mother is out on  $10,000 bond at the moment.
2. We  are more concerned about the child, and if he pulls through, we would  prefer that he not only keeps the puppy but that the little one helps  him recuperate.... we have no desire to separate them.
3. Caveat:  We are now extremely concerned about the mind set of the mother, and  what other things could happen... and since we are only allowed to  contest the welfare of the puppy; if we should consider pursuing trying  to reclaim her.

So,  right now the situation seems to be that she wrecklessly drove her car  in the parking lot, knowing full well her son was outside the car  (hanging onto the door handle) and that he was run over in the  process... we have a puppy in their care that is still in the process of  being paid for.. and we have written contracts stating that full  payment must be received for her to claim full ownership.  We want the  boy to have a fur friend forever, ad we want that forever to be.. a very  long time... but we also love the little pup and wonder if we should  try to get her back .. especially before something happens to her.

Thoughts and advice, please.

Much thanks."
861,"[Help] After months, my rescue dog still stays under the bed in our spare room about 90% of the time. Lately I've had limited success in getting her out a little more, but could really use some ideas! Thanks!",dogs,t3_a7nlsf,19,False,False,a7nlsf,"Darla came to us 10 months ago. We've only had golden retrievers before and she's our first rescue. She is a big girl, shepard mix, who was dumped after giving birth. She'd been at the shelter for about a month when we brought her home. She gets along fine with our golden and they are about the same age - 4 years old.  I suspect she wasn't so much abused as neglected. She didn't know what dog biscuits were, didn't know how to ride in a car, didn't know how to PLAY, at all. She fundamentally doesn't understand about play (and gets stressed at the dog park when dogs chase one another).  She's a little more aggressive in that situation and very protective of our other dog.

She spends 90% of her day in the bedroom that is in the far corner of the house, somehow cramming herself under the bed. I set up a crate for her and have tried other ""cavelike"" setups to help her feel at home, but she likes that spot. I thought that she might come out of it after a bit, but she hasn't really. Just lately, I've tried anew. I'll call her upstairs and give her lots of approval and when she tries to leave, I call her back and give her a treat.  Rinse and repeat.  By doing this, I've gotten her to stay with the rest of us for an hour, which is huge for her.  My question is -  if she wants to be the goth kid and have a lot of alone time, should I be messing with it? It seems to me that dogs are social creatures and she'd be happier if she learned to be part of us. Should I keep rewarding her just for hanging out with us? Are there better rewards than food rewards?  (Or is there a better approach to bringing her out of her shell?  We've tried blocking off the 'hideout' room and she just seems unhappy and anxious, so we stopped.)

Thanks so much for your help."
862,"[Discussion] Take it from me, don't adopt two puppies from the same litter.",dogs,t3_a7boq1,292,False,False,a7boq1,"tl;dr - Littermate syndrome is a very real thing and can stress you and your new family members out.

I did my research and asked the appropriate questions prior to deciding to adopt a dog from a breeder. I was informed to stay away from the idea of getting two puppies from the same litter, but told myself that my wife and I would be the exception. We were not an exception.

Feelings started to take over when visiting the breeder and interacting with the puppies. We went from ""1 only"" to ""Why not both?"" quickly. Puppies and their cuteness have a way of convincing you. We even asked the breeder about how close the siblings were and were told that they act independently. We took somebody for their word and got burned.

While I don't feel angry at the breeder as they're relatively new (comparatively) but have had positive results with their work among other people.

We knew we were going to have to remove any chance of Littermate Syndrome forming, or reducing its effect. Since first day we brought them home we decided to walk them separately and the other one will go into panic mode. This includes barking, howling, whining, urinating, pooping, you name it. It doesn't stop either, it will go on as long as the other is gone despite if another human is the house. This is limited to walking, but even being created in separate rooms, separate crates in the same room, or just simply being in separate rooms with no way to get to the other. While social with other dogs and people, you can sense an alarming amount of hesitation. The amount of anxiety was beyond anything we've ever since in dogs. We realized we had fucked up.

We've since decided to return one of the puppies to the breeder. We understand we do not have the time with our current schedules to devote to breaking this strong bond they have with each other. Let alone training them which would require them to separate AND together. It was a mistake, an expensive one at that, but it will become unreal for what damage it can cause to each other, us, and others. I can only hope that the other puppy can find a forever home that can meet it's needs. I can also hope that the breeder will change their practice of adopting out their litters since this was made aware to them.

For those considering adopting two puppies from the same litter, please take a moment. Think to yourself if you have the time to meet all of the needs it will require of you. Unless you are a very well experienced trainer, I would highly suggest not doing so."
863,[Help] Terrible first fostering experience. Am I crazy?,dogs,t3_a7tdco,0,False,False,a7tdco,"This is a little long, so TLDR: My SO and I are finishing up fostering a dog for the first time, and it's been a nightmare. Are we being crazy and expecting too much from the foster organization?

SO: My partner and I have been wanting a dog for ages, and we finally moved into a place with a nice backyard and a reasonable pet deposit. We were a little nervous about going full commitment to a dog, so when an opportunity came up to foster a ~1 year old beagle mix it seemed like a great idea.

From the start, though, it has just been an incredibly stressful and un-fun experience. We work opposite schedules generally, and there are only 2-3 days a week where the dog would need to be crated for at most 8 hours (we are sometimes able to come back for a walk at lunch, but not always). We were told by the rescue that the dog's previous foster worked similar hours so it would not be an issue. From the start, however, whenever we left her alone she would be obviously stressed out and break out of her crate. The rescue gave us some info on crate training but after a few weeks of that there was no improvement and the dog was getting even more stressed out. It is also worth noting that the dog only had these problems when we left, otherwise she was perfectly content to sleep in her crate and went in voluntarily very often. She howls incessantly during the day, according to our neighbor. When the rescue got us a gate and suggested we try gating her in a room, she tore down the sturdy gate. She has scratched the hell out of exit doors in our house (the front/back doors she sees us walk out of).

Some of the chaos she's caused when alone is just inexperience. Every time we come home and find something chewed up, it's a new lesson in puppy-proofing the house, and that's fine and to be expected. But the rescue kept blowing off the clear *symptoms* (not necessarily officially diagnosable behavior) of separation anxiety. We understand that many rescue dogs go through a decompression phase and that the amount of time can vary drastically, but this dog is incredibly stressed out when left alone and even if it is a temporary problem, she deserves help getting through it. We are more than happy to help her but we have never done this before and need help ourselves as we do not know how to approach the problem. Our inexperience and need for help should any issues arise was made abundantly clear when we were asked to foster (the president of the rescue asked us to help out, which we were happy to do since we were considering it anyway). No matter how much we asked for help, we rarely get an answer.

We had previously looked at adopting an adorable malamute mix with separation anxiety, and decided against it because we thought our first dog having anxiety issues would be a bad idea as we were not confident about our ability to properly handle it without any experience. Again, I totally get that it's way too early to diagnose anything, but after weeks of dealing with howling and scratching and chewing and getting silence, if anything, from the rescue I was ready to go insane. 

It really just comes down to the lack of communication - and this is where my main question is. What sort of help do you expect from a rescue organization when fostering a dog from them? I know they're probably dealing with a million other things and may not have time to walk a pair of panicking first-time foster parents through how to handle anxiety symptoms, but I feel like we were crazy for asking for help so many times. We had larger problems getting things they said they would provide for us - a lead for our backyard, harness to help with her pulling, some more durable chew toys - but again I have no idea if those are things a rescue will typically provide or if they're supposed to come out of our pocket. The rescue told us they would be providing anything we needed but the only things they have actually delivered on are a gate and food.

Are we crazy and needy? Was it just a shitty situation, having two people who couldn't have someone home at all times handling a dog who hated being alone? "

865,[Help] [Breed] Help finding the ideal dog breed for someone who is really active but works most of the day.,dogs,t3_a7r2gd,2,False,False,a7r2gd,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

  * I have had a dog all my life, and have trained one dog right from being a puppy.

My parents are close to 70 so they couldn't look after her long term despite the fact they love her to death and dad walking her has really improved his health. They have arthritis so haven't been good at keeping up with her brushing as she has am insanely thick coat she looks like a Swedish lapphund despite being a street dog from Cyprus so I've been paying for monthly dog grooming appointments. Realistically they cannot care for her adequately long term.

Do you think it's best that I bring her with me in March or do you think she would be happier surrounded by more people and staying with my parents ? 

I would love her to be with me as she really improves my welbeing and I can tell she loves me the most but is it fair to deprive her from all of the people just to be with me ? 

She likes beinf by herself a lot and finds a quiet place in the house to sleep so I think she will be ok when I'm at work and have a dog walker mid way through the day.

Not like they were traumatized by dogs...but more like they have insecurity problems and almost fear dogs will somehow compete with them. Ironically doh dislikes are boring as hell and a dog would make them interesting.... Strange how they fear a dog's competition against their boring lives. 

The quality I found most common among dog haters is their passive nature for life. They all tend to share a similar trait in that they are extremely boring and not someone you could or would want to talk to. They had low expectations in life and were very consumed with themselves and being the center of attention anywhere they go... Ironically they were often too boring to be the center of attention anywhere they go... But they still tried like hell.

Every dog hater I've met is insanely boring, spoiled, insecure or all three. It's like these are prerequisites for disliking dogs. 

I was thinking about this the other day and have come to the conclusion that the all the people I've met didn't like dogs all shared these traits. Almost as if they were worried a dog would take away from their own attempts at trying to be interesting and not boring... I met around a dozen peoole like this in my lifetime and every single one had these traits... I call it the ""mediocre but in  denial"" quality.

It's so bizarre and quite sad. When someone doesn't like dogs, to me, that's like saying they don't like chocolate.

But I've found these people are so because of their own deep seeded insecurities... Non dog owners are boring as hell to me but people who dislike dogs altogether are psychologically damaged in my experience.... If they did a study I bet they would prove this.

Since college I realized I met exactly 14 people who hated dogs and would never even consider getting one
... No allergies or anything like that. Just super boring, spoiled, or insecure.

I bet I'm not alone in this observation.... "

874,[Help] How to deal with a stubborn puppy?,dogs,t3_a7q5fr,14,False,False,a7q5fr,"Hi, I recently adopted my first 4 month old male puppy, that is a husky cross Pomeranian (Pomsky) 

I’ve had him just under a week and toilet training is going quite well, however I’ve noticed he can be rather stubborn. 

For example when on the lead and I pull him away from something I don’t want him to pay attention to (only a small tug on his harness and calling his name, no dragging whatsoever) such as something he should not be trying to eat, often he will respond by sitting or lying down and then refuses to move. 

Obviously I want to nip this behaviour in the bud and have him obey me when i want him to stop trying to eat something he shouldn’t or come to me. I have tried using a treat to distract him/get his attention to come to me but more often than not he is not interested as whatever I’m telling him not to eat is more appealing. 

How do you address this kind of behaviour? I am a novice dog owner and so would appreciate any advice 

Tl;dr: My dog will respond by sitting and refusing to move in protest of me trying to prevent him to eating/paying attention to things he shouldn’t, how do I get him to stop this and listen to me? "
875,[Help] I'm afraid I'm not giving my pup the love and attention it deserves.,dogs,t3_a7on45,15,False,False,a7on45," I'm a highschool student with a busy schedule, and so I made the STUPID decision of getting a puppy, thinking I had everything planned out perfectly. I guess not.  
 The puppy is about 3 months old, and it hasn't gotten all of the vaccines required to go out yet, so it's inside the house full time. We also have a crate. Since I gotta go to school, my mum lets the dog out of the crate to run freely around the house for about 3 hours. Sometimes, we let it run around the huge balcony, and it has a blast up there. But, it has to go back to the crate for 1-2 hours so that my mother can do some house chores without being afraid of smacking the puppy across the face with a broom.  
 When I come home, I make sure I give it a lot of attention for at least 1 hour before I study. After I go up to my room to study, it usually remains out of the crate for another hour, until we're all busy doing afternoon stuff, so no one can look out for it. In the evening, it gets some more time with us outside the crate, until it's late and we gotta go to sleep.  
 Not counting bedtime, it gets about 4-6 hours of crate time daily. Not all in one go, of course. Is that bad? Should it not be there that long? Am I doing a bad job? :c"
876,[Breed] [Help] Pitbull lover looking to adopt my own dog - I want a dog that I can rely to be non-aggressive and that would be ok around cats,dogs,t3_a7rz6p,26,False,False,a7rz6p,"** Update: Thank you for all of your responses. They’ve all been incredibly helpful. 

I’ve been giving it a lot of thought and have decided that I am going to look at local rescues for the breeds other people have suggested. That said, I am not going to *completely* rule out pits either.  Instead, I’m just going to wait for the right individual dog and reach out to the rescues to find an older dog that is really happy living with cats and gets along well with other dogs. 

Whichever dog I get, I’ll be sure it’s one that I know I can give the adequate amount of exercise, training, &amp; attention to. I feel comfortable that I am a responsible dog owner and someone who puts a great deal of thought before putting an animal in any situations that might be stressful (or just new &amp; exciting) - so will just need to be honest with myself if I will be happy making the type of adjustments I may need for whichever individual dog I adopt. (I’m recognizing there are trade-offs and I may not be able to find everything I want in one dog, which is ok too.)  

I also think I may get a cat first so that I can remove the “it’s really lonely without having a pet for the first time in 28 years” factor from the equation. That will make it a bit easier to allow myself the time to find the perfect dog, even if it makes introducing them a little more challenging for me.

Filling out the questionnaire was a *really* helpful exercise towards really being honest with myself about the time &amp; energy commitment I’m able to make. I hope every prospective dog owner takes the time to do this, even if they think they know what breed they want. **

*eta: I seem to have messed up the formatting - I’m on the mobile app &amp; am not sure how to fix it 😕*

Hi r/dogs! I‘ve lost both my cat &amp; my dog in the past year and am ready to bring some new life into my life. 

The thing is, pitbulls have been my favorite breed since I was a kid (30+ years ago) and I’m having a hard time opening myself to any other breeds. (I’ve filled out the breed questionnaire below) 

I’m not at all against getting a pitbull, but the one I lived with ended up being euthanized after he attacked/mauled his owner on 3 occasions (we think he was protecting me). I don’t want to get into graphic detail, but it’s the most violence I’ve seen in my life &amp; I still have nightmares from it a year later. (please don’t judge me - it was not my dog and I tried to handle it as responsibly as possible, given I was not its owner).  

It wasn’t entirely out of the blue, the dog had been reactive towards its owner on past occasions, and my sense is there may have been some abuse going on (this person is no longer in my life). He (the dog) had also been on Prozac that the owner decided to stop giving him &amp; discontinued without consulting a vet or going through a weaning process. 

They’re still my favorite breed and I’m not afraid to be around pitbulls (I still felt safe having the other pitbull sleep with me even after the attacks), but it’s made me a little anxious about living with one (I live by myself and am smallish and female). I’m worried it will “turn on me” or hurt my (future) cat.  

Can you help offer some suggestions that might open up some other options for me or ways to be sure I’m adopting a dog whose temperament I can rely on? 

Top priority is being able to have my dog share a home with a cat and no aggression towards people or other dogs. I’m open to adopting an older dog (5-6 yrs old) 

Thank you! 

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I had a pit bull basically dumped on me when its owner left town for a year. He was not an easy dog; I was not prepared to be a dog owner, but I did my best and made sure he was loved and well-cared for (but admittedly was in over my head - he definitely was not a “first time dog” kind of dog). I lived with the dog for almost 3 years, part of the time his owner lived with me. 

That said, I don’t have any experience training dogs. There was a weird dynamic with my last dog since he wasn’t really “my” dog and his owner was weird about not wanting the dog to like me better than him -  kind of an “all the responsibility, none of the authority” situation. (I sometimes refer to the dog as “my dog” since it sounds less confusing). As mentioned above, things took a really bad turn. 

(Despite the challenges, I absolutely loved that dog with all my heart and he’s the reason I want to get a dog.)

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescue. I get the value of going to a reputable breeder, but my passion is animal rescue, so I don’t think I’d be comfortable buying a dog. (It will be an older dog; not a puppy) 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* The most important qualities: Non-aggressive &amp; able to be trusted with a cat. 

Easy going, loving, likes to snuggle. 
Has the energy to do easy hikes, walks, etc. but won’t lose their mind if exercise is offset by mental stimulation. The type of dog you can bring for a walk with your friend’s dog or take to a dog-friendly cafe/bar. Derpy goofball is a bonus. 

Fairly low maintenance. One that has an average or longer-than-average life span (I just lost 2 pets in the past year)  

I’m kind of a tactile person, so maybe not so crazy about a scruffy dog if it’s fur isn’t soft to touch. (Not a deal breaker though) 

No bulging eyes or snorting breathing.

A dog who is solid &amp; can make me feel safe.  

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Staffies/Pitbulls - I love their derp factor, that they have the energy for active stuff but are also couch potatoes, that they’re such snugglebugs, &amp; their fat heads. I also feel safer home alone &amp; out walking with them.

I also like border collies, Australian Shepard’s, German Shepards, lab mixes, standard poodles, and any sort of medium to large scruffy/shaggy dogs (but from what I’ve read about the breeds, worry they may be either too high strung, energetic, easily bored, or have high prey drives) 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience commands for its safety &amp; mine (sit, stay, come, drop), fun stuff like “high five” would be nice but not necessary. Ideally, I’d like to eventually train it to be a psychiatric service dog, so Canine Good Citizen skills, DPT, blocking and guiding me to nearest exit (this isn’t a deal breaker for me though)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I’ll be spending most hours of the day with my dog. I’m home almost all day and will bring the dog with me when possible. I figure the training is kind of an all-day, all-the-time thing, but am figuring 1.5 - 3 dedicated hours of quality time (focused on what the dog wants/needs) a day (including walking &amp; grooming). 

I also plan on going to obedience training and maybe agility training (only for fun &amp; to keep the dog happy, not competing or anything)

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* At least one hour (2 half hour walks) each day. The type of exercise would depend on the dog - beach, hiking trails, using my bike or a scooter alongside it if its energy level exceeds mine. If I’m honest with myself, it’s not so much a matter of how much time I have, it’s a motivation issue - part of why I want a dog is because it forces me to get out of my house. I’m in decent physical shape so can handle the extra exercise. 

The dog park makes me a little anxious to be honest.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I’m fine with trimming hair &amp; nails, giving baths, and cleaning ears. If the dog loves getting brushed, I’ll brush it daily - but don’t want a dog that will have issues with its coat if I miss a few days.

I’d prefer not to have the added expense of needing a professional groomer but it’s not a deal-breaker. I’m also fine with trimming its fur myself if that’s a thing. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* medium to smaller end of large - I don’t really like small dogs (I mean, they’re fine for other people). I like a dog who’s got enough weight that it calms me when we snuggle on the couch. My place isn’t huge, so a super large dog isn’t ideal. My 75lb pit bull was fine in here, but I probably would prefer a dog closer to 50lbs so that I can lift it or carry it if safety or health issues require it.  

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I’m not a fan of shedding. I don’t mind hair getting on the furniture, but ideally, I don’t want a dog that sheds all over anyone who visits or that my carpet is covered with hair if I don’t vacuum daily. Barking depends on the circumstance. I live in an end unit on a busy street, so barking every time someone passes outside would get old. Barking non stop when left alone would be an issue too, since I live in an apartment. I get that dogs bark - I just don’t want it excessive/constant. (Yipping is out. I don’t have a high tolerance for dogs that yip). Slobber is yucky, but dogs drool. I’m not a huge fan of feeling like I need a towel every time I pet it, but my last dog had issues with licking his paws and I’m used to giant wet spots on the couch. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It’s not vital, but I feel like it would open up more opportunities for playing/exercising since I don’t have a yard. At the very least, I’d like a dog I could train to be let off leash for safety issues (like if I dropped the leash or it got out or something) 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I don’t know if I have a strong preference on this - I want a dog that wants to be with me, but I’m fine if it is happy to just be in the same room doing its own thing. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking when someone comes to the door is fine; not barking is fine too.      I don’t want a dog that will be reactive/aggressive with strangers &amp; visitors. As long as the dog can be trained to go to their pillow or their crate &amp; settle down, I don’t have a strong preference. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. This is a dealbreaker. I have too much anxiety around my dog hurting someone else’s dog. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Any sort of aggression. As mentioned above, dog I lived with ended up being euthanized after attacking his owner and I still have a lot of anxiety around something like that happening. Plus I don’t want a dog that I can’t trust around an indoor cat (will make sure the cat has “escape routes”, etc., but it’s still a concern I have)

Yipping or non-stop talking/barking. (Walter the French Bulldog is adorable to watch in a 2 minute video, but I’d lose my shit dealing with that all day long) 

I’d like to avoid a dog that is prone to “piddling” whenever they get excited. 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Generally no more than 1-2 hours at a time a few days a week. Maybe 4-5 hours once or twice a week (if I take a class or go to a movie or dinner with friends). 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* It’s just me. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I plan to get a cat/kitten 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Breed/weight restrictions are not a concern. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* There aren’t any breed laws in my city

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* generally between 70-85° except during heat waves. I think it sometimes drops to 50° at night in the winter (I’m in SoCal) 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* 

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

How much does breed matter if you are getting a mixed breed from a shelter or rescue? 

Is there an age after which a dog’s temperament is considered a “known” or can a dog become aggressive without prior signs of aggression?

877,[Vent] [Discussion] Why is it so hard to find good dog food?!,dogs,t3_a7po6x,23,False,False,a7po6x,"After a year of awful digestive issues and trying several different foods I was finally able to find a food that didn't bother my dog's stomach. Well fast forward two years and now my vet is telling me to switch my dog onto a new grain-inclusive food with the new DCM research. My vet didn't specify any brands, just to avoid grain-free varieties and newer brands. From what I've seen online it seems like most people recommend Royal Canin, Hills Science Diet, and Purina, but a look at the ingredients lists for all three brands makes me wary.

Royal Canin (Large Adult) has chicken by-product meal as the first ingredient.

Hills Science Diet (Advanced Fitness Variety) has pea fiber as the second ingredient , whereas other varieties have corn/corn meal high up on the ingredients list.

Purina Pro Plan (Bright Mind Chicken and Rice) has poultry by-product meal and corn gluten meal in the first five ingredients

WHYYYY is it so hard to find a dog food that has a specified protein source as one of the top ingredients without by-product meals and questionable fillers as the next ingredients? Has anyone found the holy grail of dog food? If so, you deserve all the awards.

879,[help] trying to play with my dog,dogs,t3_a7pcf7,4,False,False,a7pcf7,"5 months ago I adopted a 4 year old Red Heeler. 

About once a week he will get into a weird mood where he constantly paws at me, and boops(punches) me with his nose. I'll try to play with him with toys, but he'll start ignoring the toy after 10 seconds. This devolves into 20 minutes of belly rubs before he finally calms down. 

He usually does this not long after a walk, so I don't think he wants to go out. I've never had a dog do this before, but I've also never had a heeler. 

Any suggestions about what he is doing or wants? is this totally normal, and I should just accept my new life as Official Belly Rubber?"
880,[Help] the high prey drive dog I'm adopting is also extremely shy,dogs,t3_a7rgic,5,False,False,a7rgic,"I adopted my dog from a breeder (who lives in a rural area) when she was 5 months old. When I brought her home to the city it took her a little while to get acclimated to the sounds of cars starting unexpectedly and just being in a more noisy environment, but has done great. She loves all other animals and though it takes her a little while to warm up to new people, she loves them after getting used to them. I socialized her a lot as a pup and she's great in any situation I've put her in. She's a complete sweetheart. 

The breeder had kept her littermate sister, but soon after we picked up our girl, breeder ended up getting sick with a chronic and potentially terminal illness that required her to travel a lot out of the area for treatment.  I dont want to make any assumptions, but I am guessing the other puppy was not socialized properly due to the breeder being so ill. I met both puppies together and both were friendly and sweet at 5 months old. So,  the breeder said she was putting up my dog's sister for adoption (now 2 y/o), and I was immediately interested. The breeder said she had high prey drive and was shy which I thought about and decided that was something I could handle. After talking to her again she stressed that the dog isnt just shy, but extremely shy. She isnt at all aggressive, but will cower when meeting new people if her owner isnt present. She does great at home and loves being around her people and is fine when new people come over as long as her owner is there, but isnt great in new environments. She also said she will be better in an environment with another dog. 

I have never had an extremely shy dog before. It sounds like she may also be codependent. I feel like the reason she is so shy is possibly due to neglect, which breaks my heart. I think I still want to give it a trial run, is this crazy? Any advice from people with shy rescues? I am willing to get a trainer and do what it takes, but I really dont know what to expect. My first instinct was to try and socialize her, but after some internet research the best thing is to take it very slow? I also want to add my first priority is providing a safe and happy home for the dog I currently have, will bringing a shy dog home have any impact on her? "
881,[Help] Advice for Integrating my New Puppy,dogs,t3_a7r94l,2,False,False,a7r94l,"Hi All- I have just introduced a new French Bulldog puppy (12 weeks old), Frankie, into my home where I have a 1.5 yr old male French Bulldog named Biscuit. Neither are neutered. Whenever I first got Biscuit my vet in Seattle, who specializes in the breed, recommended that we not neuter him until he is 2 yrs to ensure that his muscles and bone development aren't stunted before he has fully filled out. Biscuit is super personable and friendly- including with other dogs. After bringing Frankie home to meet Biscuit for the first time this past Saturday- Biscuit was very apprehensive and confused. He barked and snapped at Frankie several times so I put Frankie inside a small crate and left it in the living room so that Biscuit could get used to his smell, presence etc. I would take Frankie out every so often and let them further socialize. It seemed to have worked and after 48 hours they are playing like best buds however Biscuit still has moments where he snaps at Frankie causing him to yelp, cry and run and hide, which breaks my heart to see. When Biscuit does this I spray him with water bottle and say a firm NO BITING. Biscuit runs off, hides as he knows he did something bad. I'm on Day 5 now and while they are playing, I don't trust leaving them unsupervised as I worry Biscuit will snap/bite him again and not be reprimanded. Any tips or tricks that you all can provide me for breaking Biscuit of his snappy tendencies? He usually snaps at Frankie over toys or treats. I am thinking of having Biscuit neutered asap but worry that this could throw the balance of power off between him and the new puppy since Frankie won't be neutered until he fills out. Any help is appreciated! I've heard e-collars are a good technique but I don't like the idea of shocking Biscuit to cause pain, which is why I use a water bottle. Thanks in advance."

What kinds of collars do you all have for your wrinkly pups? "

885,[Help] How long is too long to walk a large breed puppy? (4 months),dogs,t3_a7q3j4,7,False,False,a7q3j4,"I see a lot of guidelines like ""5 minutes per month of age twice daily"", but 20 minutes twice a day doesn't seem like nearly enough for our aussie/golden retriever mix. If I took her in after 20 minutes, she'd still be bouncing off the walls. But if I let her set the pace on our walk or take her to the dog park, it's an hour-long walk before she finally slows down.  


I know Aussies are bred to run around all day herding sheep, and she got quite a few aussie traits, but she'll be a larger dog (65-70lbs) and I'm worried about hurting her joints/bone development if I let her exercise until she's tired while she's this young. But honestly... 20 minutes twice a day just really doesn't seem like enough to tire her out so she can chill out with us in the evenings, and it takes about 10 minutes just to get to the off-leash area near our house. Am I causing more damage than good by letting her stay out this long, or is it ok since she's setting her own pace?"

888,[HELP] Is my puppy playing normally?,dogs,t3_a7pi6h,9,False,False,a7pi6h,"I live in an apartment with my 6.5 month old puppy. Our neighbours across the hall from us also have a puppy who is a bit older - we got our puppy after they had theirs. It worked out nicely because their puppy had all of their vaccination shots when we got our puppy, so they have been playing with each other since we got him. Lately I have been concerned that they are playing with each other properly, though. My puppy does not interact with any other dog/puppy the way that he does with her and my neighbours say the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

When we go to take our puppies out and see each other the dogs go crazy. They are always begging and whining at each others doors to play. When they do get together it's just constant growling and snarling at each other. My neighbours female dog is mostly the submissive one and will often roll onto her back with my puppy on top of her. They bite at each others neck/face/ears, but generally they do not cry out anymore in pain (they used to as younger puppies, but now it's just the growling and snarling). Sometimes my puppy will be more interested in looking for things to eat off the ground so he will ignore my neighbours puppy, which pisses her off and she will keep trying to bite and instigate more playing. Other times they will ignore each other alltogether and just lay on the ground hanging out.  


Is this normal puppy playing? I know it likely is - they just sound so aggressive and vicious when they are playing. With other dogs my puppy will be more submissive and will often jump up to try and lick the other dog's face. I have seen him playing very gently with smaller puppies before and he is absolutely submissive with bigger dogs - he will usually adopt the playful bowing pose.

891,[Discussion] Destructive pup,dogs,t3_a7p5r9,6,False,False,a7p5r9,"So I've got 2 dogs, one of which is about 11 month old boxer-pit. She is relatively destructive as of late.

We used to lock them in the kitchen, with access to the yard when my wife and I would go to work (~8 hours alone). They were doing well, so I gave them access to the rest of the house. The pitbull-boxer would find anything on the table she could get at and destroy it. No problem, nothing on the table. I like the excuse to keep it clean. However, she has started destroying my couch now. Both pillows gone, and now she's progressively tearing apart the fabric on the side of the couch, so I set up a camera to watch. I leave around 0700 and she looks on the table, finds nothing, then goes to sleep on the couch. Around 0900-1000 daily, she and the other dog start playing, and then she starts to tear at the couch. So now they are back to the kitchen. I tried putting dog beds in the kitchen for them, but they lasted one day before destruction.

So my question, is this separation anxiety? She doesn't start tearing apart the couch until about 2-3 hours after we leave, so I'm leaning toward not SA. Is this puppy phase that she'll grow out of? I do exercise them about 1 hour daily throwing the ball when I get home, so I don't think it's too little exercise. Would this be something that CBD treats could help?"

They have a female Akita puppy who at 7 months old is now towering over my Toby. They met before with no problems, but as she's gotten older she's apparently become food aggressive. We were making food for my girlfriends nieces and nephews and their dog got very aggressive towards my dog being in the kitchen with us.

893,"[Discussion]Any tips for getting through my puppy's first heat without murdering her? (jk on the murdering, of course)",dogs,t3_a7oru3,11,False,False,a7oru3,"Just to head off any breeding discussion or ""get her spayed"" advice, I'll start by saying that she is not a breeding prospect but I do plan to use her for a sport and our vet and trainer both suggested that we let her go through a heat or two before spaying her for developmental reasons. So, that's that.

Anyway, she's going CRAZY. She can already be a bit of an intense puppy (heeler mix) but this is insane, and I'm used to intense dogs. She wants to be with me all the time and even tries to climb on me while I'm working, despite never being particularly clingy before. She seems to have forgotten all of her commands. She had appropriate chewing down pat until she went into heat, and now she's eating my house. She's harassing my other dogs who she previously got along with just fine.

I'm obviously not really upset with her as I know those hormones are making her a little crazy and she can't help it. But I'm just wondering if there are any ways I can help her be a little more comfortable and calmer, aside from the usual stuff like exercise and training. I've been around bitches in heat before but not too often, and none of them went off the rails to quite this degree!"
894,[Discussion] Dog Went Missing But Returned Under Kind Of Strange Circumstances,dogs,t3_a7kr77,6,False,False,a7kr77,"Maybe I'm overthinking it but just wanted to see what others thought.

My dog went missing, she was round my parents(they live round the corner), dog was in front garden, apparently my mum had stepped inside for a minute, came back out and she was gone.

This was really unlike her, she never likes to go to far from other people's sight. My mum thought she couldn't have gone far and went looking but with no luck.

She came and got me and before I knew it half the village was out looking for.

To absolutely no luck.

Around midnight I came home, at this point everyone in the village and Facebook knew and was watching out for her.

The whole situation just didn't make sense to me, she isn't the sort to wander off, she doesn't even chase cats. 

She also instantly responds to any kind of whistling, with half the village whistling for her.

Then at 1am I get a call, she's back! It was the greatest thing I had ever heard, it was true bliss.

Apparently my parents dog had started barking and she was at the front gate.

The weird part though was she was warm and dry, it was cold and had been raining several hours (stopped about an hour before finding her).

On top of this, my dogs not a barker and the front gate is far from their house, it seemed strange for my parents dog to just start barking.

End of the day I'm just glad she's back and I'm never letting her out of my sight again.

Most likely she just got lost but part of me wonders if someone could have taken her locally and then dropped her off when she became 'to hot to handle' or they saw she was spayed and had very unquie markings (she's very easy to identify).

Maybe I am overthinking it but one thing I will say that I've learnt, is you can never be too careful."

903,[Breeds] Thinking about getting a dog,dogs,t3_a7jwzo,11,False,False,a7jwzo,"Hi,

I've been putting some thought into getting a dog for the first time. I read the info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/first-time-dog-owner), and while I have a lot more planning to do and decisions to make before I go through with this, I was curious about what breeds, ages, sexes, and so on I should be considering. I'm making plans to ""test drive"" some of my friends' dogs, so maybe I'm jumping the gun a bit by posting here before I do that. Don't take me too seriously, but I'm interested in your opinions.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This would be my first dog

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I think I'd prefer to rescue, but I'm not opposed to a breeder. I'm actually interested in ""trying out"" an older dog that's already trained and a bit more mellow. I'd love to hear opinions about whether this is a good idea. I definitely *don't* want to deal with a dog that has major issues or will cost a fortune in healthcare. But I like the idea of a shorter, less high stakes, but still mutually beneficial relationship.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I'm not sure if this is realistic, but since you asked: A dog that could not rip up my house for 8 hours (more realistically, 4 since I live literally next door to my work and could let it out and even walk it during lunch. It would be capable of running at least 5 miles, hopefully it could do more as I got into running longer distances.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Australian Cattle Dog: Would be physically capable of running or hiking. Smart. Looks cool as fuck. Sounds like it could be difficult to deal with for a new owner though, particularly a younger dog.
* Malinois: Also looks cool.
* Golden Retriever: Seem to have a reputation for being easy to care for and train. Adorable.


5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Run with me
* Hike with me on multi-day camping trips (off leash would be kinda cool, but I'm not sure what the expert opinions are on that as far as ethics)
* I assume obedience is a given? I want to be able to take it out in public without endangering other people or the dog. I don't want a dog to be something I have to constantly worry about misbehaving.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Excluding exercise? Is it wildly unrealistic to say maybe .5 - 1 hour of direct interaction?

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I'd like it to be content with about an hour of jogging, 5 - 10 miles. I don't know a ton about dog parks but obviously I'm not opposed to the idea.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing is fine. If it's easy to groom at home I'd do it, otherwise I can afford to pay a pro.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* 50ish pounds or larger

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle shedding. Barking wouldn't be great, I like my neighbors. I'm not a huge fan of slobber.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I'd really like to be able to do this.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* No strong preference, they both have benefits

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I don't want it to suffer while I'm at work 40 hours a week, and I don't want it to kill my social life. I'd like to be able to go out once a week after work for say, 4 hours after walking the dog. And on the weekend I'd like to be able to spend one day without babysitting the dog other than taking it for a run at the end of the day. Are those reasonable expectations?

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* It's okay, perhaps even desired, if the dog barks a bit to let me know someone's there. I don't want it to jump on people out of joy, and I don't want it to growl at people and scare them away. Between those points I don't have a strong preference.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* It doesn't have to live with other dogs or kids, but it shouldn't act aggressive towards them out running or during brief visits.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Definitely no humping people. I fucking hate when peoples dogs do that to me.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I broke this down in detail in 13, but I work 40 hours a week (either 5 x 8 or 4 x 10). I live next to work, so I might even be able to get away with 2 half hour visits a day. I'd like to be able to spend one day of the weekend away from home the majority of the day. Hopefully taking the dog with me when I can, but sometimes I wouldn't be able to.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent. No breed or weight restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Warren, MI. I'm not aware of any, but I don't want a rottweiler or pit bull anyway so I doubt it matters.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* summer: 80f, winter: 30f

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

Do I have unrealistic expectations for the amount of care a dog would need?

Is a senior dog an okay idea? Would I be an awful person if I wasn't willing to spend more than say, $1000 on emergency or chronic medical issues (routine check ups or mild illness not included)?

Any great resources for first time dog owners? Obviously I'll research this myself as well, but it's always nice to get personal advice."

906,[help] Need reassurance that I’m making the right decision to euthanize my dog now,dogs,t3_a7kbah,6,False,False,a7kbah,"Hi everyone, I know this isn’t a fun topic at all but I appreciate those who are staying to listen to me and provide me some insight or advice. 



I have had a couple family dogs put down before. However, neither of them died from causes related to old age. One was injured and the other was struck with a sudden extreme illness. This is the first time I’m having to analyze our situation and try to make the best decision for my dog and my family. 



A little backstory, I adopted my dog about 3 years ago. He was anywhere from 7-9 years old at the time and is now anywhere from 10-12 years old. I adopted him due to his old age, he had been with the adoption agency for a while and I connected with him and wanted to make sure his last few years were happy and full of love. He has definitely had a wonderful and comfortable time with my family and I am so grateful for that. 



Well now for the issue at hand. I recently moved out of my house for college across town (about 30mins from home). And haven’t been able to be at home much. However in the amount of time I did see my dog and now that I’m home for the holiday I’ve seen some changes and decline in his behavior and health. 



He’s started vomiting, seemingly at random times. Has had a couple potty accidents in the house since I left. While he used to only have arthritis and slight dystrophy in his hind legs he now has it in his front legs as well. His hearing completely left in the 3 months I was at school. He’s developing cataracts. His teeth are terrible, they must be painful at this point although he still chews his food. I’m afraid he’s experiencing issues with his heart as he’s had trouble catching his breath, snores much louder now, and has started “hacking”. He’s had at least three tumors on his abdomen since I adopted him and they are much larger now (no biopsy but different vets have said they’re a probably just benign fatty tumors)



His behavior has also changed. He has started resource guarding to the point where my mom can’t enter her own bedroom to sleep with my father unless the dog doesn’t notice her come in. He cannot be groomed at all, by family or professionals. He snaps and runs away even when I try to do it. (When he was younger he let me shave and groom his entire body). He has become a lot more “pestery”, constantly asking my father for food while this previously was not a problem. 



My family will be going on vacation next week and the only person I trust to take care of him will also be out of town. I feel extremely uncomfortable boarding him as I know he is in pain and it would make him incredibly anxious. I’ve read probably 20 “how to know it’s time to put your dog to sleep” articles and they’ve all been pretty convincing at this point. I’m conflicted because while he has declined a lot in the past three months, he still is a very cheerful dog and still enjoys food and playing. At the same time, I know he’s in pain and I don’t want to wait until the last possible moment to make the decision because I don’t want him to suffer more than he has to. I also have to take my family into consideration as they have taken on responsibility for him. I do not want to burden them with my dogs accidents and behavior as he declines further. 



TLDR: My dog has considerably declined over the last three months. Though he still has a lively personality, I know he is in pain and  I do not want to wait until the last possible moment to euthanize him. "
