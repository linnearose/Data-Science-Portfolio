0,[Mod Post][Survey] /r/dogs Official Demographics Survey,dogs,t3_a2pcty,77,False,False,a2pcty,"Hey there, errybody. It's about time we updated our demographic information since our subreddit--and Reddit in general--has changed so much since the last time we did this. I put together a Google survey. All answers are reported anonymously and we won't use the information for anything other than learning about the subreddit and making the subreddit better (and for fun stats like ""most popular dog name in /r/dogs""). It should take less than 10 minutes to complete, maybe a little longer if you have a lot of dogs. 

You'll be asked for the breed of your dog(s) and I added some mixes and non-AKC breeds to the list. The mixes and non-AKC breeds appear first. Scroll down for the AKC breeds listed in alphabetical order. 

Breeds not listed: 

* Mini vs Standard Poodle -- select Poodle

* Jack Russel Terrier --  select Parson Russell Terrier or Russell Terrier

* Catahoula -- added to the end of the list

* Afghan Hound -- added to the end of the list

* Pyrenean Mastiff -- added to the end of the list

* Some other purebred that isn't listed here - select ""other"" at the end of the list

Sorry, everyone. The list is kind of a nightmare to update.

2,[fluff] lost my dog's leash whilst on walk - little man did me proud,dogs,t3_aa0u90,40,False,False,aa0u90,"Went on a looooong old walk with my boy this morning along a canal path. It's generally pretty empty save a few bikes and other dog walkers. He's reliable off leash but I always hook him up when we pass roads/other animals/on leash dogs as he still gets excited over exciting things. 

Anyway, we hit the 6 mile mark and were coming up to a road so I called him back to me, reached for the leash around my neck... And it wasn't there! 

We went back on ourselves to where I last used it but I just couldn't find it. I decided to head to the nearest pub where I knew they had dogs. We ended up walking over 2 miles past fields of cows and sheep, cyclists and a very excited puppy on leash and my boy stayed by my side the whole time! 

It was like the most intense training session EVER! I tried to limit my commands so I didn't overload him, but it was like he knew something was up so was super responsive to everything! Walking next to me past livestock, sitting next to me while cyclists went by and waiting to be released to greet the puppy. 

I WAS SO PROUD 

Gave him lots of roast potatoes when we got to the pub. 

It was great.

3,[VENT] Please do not feed my dog.,dogs,t3_a9ri4o,1,False,False,a9ri4o," 

I know, I know, for the 99% of you, this is common sense. But it seems that common sense isn't so common now a days.

My fellow dog loving redditors, I'm sure you've all been in that situation where someone gives your dog a treat without asking you first.

If you're that person feeding other dogs... Stop. Stop right now. You wouldn't feed someone's child right?

Speaking from experience, my dog has a serious pancreas issue and can only eat special treats prescribed by the vet. And while I appreciate your good intentions, you're not the one who's stuck paying the vet bill when you inadvertently ""poison"" my best friend.

All I ask is that you take 5 seconds to ask the owner if it's OK first."
4,[Fluff] Went to the vet for the first time today with an eye infection,dogs,t3_aa0ngt,8,False,False,aa0ngt,"Yesterday we woke up to Thors right eye slightly swollen and a small bit of puss oozing out from the corner of his eye.

We kept an eye on it and decided to take him to the vet today to make sure it wasn't anything serious.

This was the first time we've taken him to the vet, so we were slightly worried how he would react. He has been before but since we're his third owners, we hadn't had the pleasure yet.

He was SUCH a good boy at the vet! The vet praised him for being so inquisitive and curious and loving of new people. Usually the breed can be quite shy and reserved with new people.

He squirmed a little when the vet had to put fluorescent dye in his eyes to check his corneas but nothing too serious.

It was about time he got his yearly vaccines and check up so we decided to do this and save on having to get a new time next month.

He didn't even flinch when he got his shot and besides a bit of tartar (I think thats what it's called, we call it toothstones) a little too much weight and a small eye infection, he seems perfectly healthy.

He has been awarded with lots of pets and snuggles when we got home.

6,[Help] My dog is not friendly to my husband,dogs,t3_aa2uys,3,False,False,aa2uys,"Hey all.

A bit of background: I've had my dog, a female shepherd/husky cross named Karma, for a little over three years now. She was about three when I got her and I was told she had been badly abused by a man in the past, so she would be a bit careful around men in general going forward. I'm female, so she bonded to me quite easily and we're the best of friends.

My husband recently moved in with me, as of September this year. When I'm around, she still clearly prefers my company, but will tolerate him or sometimes even indulge him in play. When I'm not around, or even if I'm just sleeping, she is very cold to him. She growls and shows her teeth when he approaches, hides upstairs from him, and won't even come down when asked if she wants to go for a walk (#1 favourite thing in the world) or offered food (#2 favourite thing in the world). He has even tried to put her collar and leash on while she's upstairs, so that she understands he really means he wants to take her for a walk, and she will just lay there and stare at him, refusing to budge. The only thing that ever works is pouring her dog food into her dish, which brings her running downstairs at top speed, at which point he can slip on her collar and leash and take her outside for a walk. On her walks with him, she is completely fine.

He has never hit her. He offers her food, treats, cuddles, pets, and play very often, but she never warms up to him unless I'm in the room. How can we get her to like him more? I know the abuse in the past is the key factor here, but it's been over three years since that's happened at least, and my dad also used to live in this house, so surely she understands by now that men are not all bad. She even approaches men she doesn't know who visit our home, or men we encounter on walks, albeit carefully.

Thanks for any suggestions!

7,"[Breeds] DNA test results in for my ""2 year old lab mix""",dogs,t3_aa1q0c,5,False,False,aa1q0c,"I adopted Waffle about 6 weeks ago and instantly wanted to be sure of his breed background so I could have some more guidance on how to approach training. I thought he was around two years old but learned quickly he is MUCH younger-- right around one year old probably, so still has a lot of puppy behavior.

I have been frustrated that he seems somewhat disinterested in treats and learning new commands. I haven't dealt with a dog before that just doesn't seem to connect the ask with the reward. He knows sit very well but even after 6 weeks needs a gentle reminder that I'm asking him to do something. I've been saying ""potty"" and trying to give treats every time he goes to the bathroom outside and yet still he does it on his own time. [Well I think his surprising DNA results help explain some of that...](https://imgur.com/a/SgLWw4X)

8,[Discussion] To Samoyed owners in this subreddit or anyone who’s owned both A Siberian and a Samoyed.,dogs,t3_aa2363,0,False,False,aa2363,"What are Samoyeds like compared to Siberians? I own a 2 year old Siberian and he’s great. We run twice a day 3k each time, but I know one day he won’t need that much running, so the idea is in the future to get a second dog to keep up with my daily exercise. Are Samoyeds as good running dogs? Same energy? Less? More? I really have a soft spot for Northern dogs. "
9,[breeds] Help me choose a dog please!,dogs,t3_aa1wke,1,False,False,aa1wke,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* This will be the first dog I own by myself. I grew up with dogs, though.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* I prefer to rescue a dog

 3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* I live in an apartment, so I need something that is fine with not having too much space. However, I go hiking a lot and I live in an area that has good parks, so I want something that will be able to keep up on a hike (or is at least easy to carry if it gets tired and I have to carry it).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* I would like something smaller since I live in an apartment. I've only ever had border collies, so I would be comfortable with something similar to that, but a border collie's energy level and need for stimulation will not fit my lifestyle at this time. I've also spent time around golden retrievers, but I worry that those would be too big for my current lifestyle.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* The most important thing is being good with people and other dogs and being a good walker. I would also like to teach the dog to do tricks, but that's not very important.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* Several hours a day. I am gone for work about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so I worry the dog would not get enough interaction, but besides that I will be able to interact with the dog almost all the time.  

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* I plan on walking the dog for at least an hour every day. I don't think there is a dog park in my area, but there are a lot of dogs around, so it will get plenty of interaction with other dogs and people.  

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I am open to brushing and basic grooming at home. If the dog needs an actual haircut beyond basic trimming, I will take it to a groomer, but I would prefer to keep this to a few times a year rather than a monthly trip to the groomer. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Something smaller that can live in an apartment. I believe most apartments in my area have a 50 lbs limit for dogs, so something smaller than that. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* I prefer a minimum on all three. A quieter dog would be ideal since I live in an apartment.  

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* I would like a dog that can learn to handle itself off-leash so I don't have to worry about what it may do, but I do not intend to let my dog off-leash in an unfenced area.  

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* I would like a snuggly dog.  

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* I would like an eager-to-please dog.  

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I would like a dog that will alert me to someone entering our home, but doesn't go crazy with barking and jumping.  

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No. Because of the area I live in and living in an apartment, a dog-aggressive dog is not an option. There are other dogs in my building, so the dog will at some point encounter another dog in the elevator. It must be able to behave with other dogs and people in an elevator.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* Chewing on things  

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* About 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* I am the only person in the household, so the dog will be my responsibility.  

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* I may at some point get a cat.  

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* No, but there are children in my neighborhood, so I would like to teach the dog how to interact with children.  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I currently rent. I believe the weight restriction is 50 lbs and under.  

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* I live in Wisconsin. I am not sure about laws banning specific breeds in my area, but I am not interested in controversial breeds, such as pitbulls, because I rent and they would limit my housing options.  

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* The temperature in Wisconsin fluctuates a lot. A summer day is usually around 80F, but can get into the 90s. A winter day is around 20F, but can get well below zero.  

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* I travel a lot throughout the state, so the dog will also be traveling a lot. I need something that will be good with car rides. A typical long car ride will be 1-4 hours a few times a month. There will be plenty of opportunities to stop and let the dog out, so it won't be 4 hours straight in the car.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  \* Is there a dog that is even right for my lifestyle? I worry about leaving it home for 8 hours while I'm at work. "
10,[Vent] People need to stop putting their hands on random strangers' dogs in public places without asking. ESPECIALLY when I'm actively training the dog.,dogs,t3_a9vthd,19,False,False,a9vthd,"Some people disagree with me, but I'm of the opinion that dogs don't really like being pet on the head.  I know that about 2/3 of the dogs I've had in my life (over a dozen) would much prefer a chest pat.

Then we amp that up by introducing the people who don't ask permission to pet a stranger's dog and just assume that because the dog looked their way and isn't growling that touching it is okay.  And then they always go for the head.

Then we amp that up because a lot of these people have children.  Some of these children get to the dogs before the parents do and immediately man-handle them whilst squealing and screaming.  This could be *extremely* dangerous and result in a dog being put down for being ""dangerous"" or ""aggressive"" when he was actually unexpectedly tackled from behind by two rambunctious children.

Then...  We amp *that* up by throwing my training into the mix.  I cannot tell you how many times a week my training sessions get fucked up by random folks or their kids coming up behind me then touching the dog as I'm working with it.  I really can't stand it when they *call the dog to jump up on them.*  I can catch them if they're coming from the sides or in front of me, but when I'm working the dogs and their owners and they come up from behind, I usually don't see them until there's a hand near the dog's face.

It pisses these folks off when I tell them not to touch the dog because it's in training.  I really want to ask them how they'd feel if someone just ran up behind their child and picked her/him up and gave it a kiss on the cheek?  And that's still not incorporating the risk of freaking out a skittish dog and causing it to snarl or bite.  People usually don't bite, even when they're freaked out...

I can't believe this isn't common courtesy knowledge.  Maybe it's because I grew up around dogs and have worked with them for seven years...  But it's still unbelievable to me."
11,[Help] Carsickness for Dogs,dogs,t3_aa1wfa,4,False,False,aa1wfa,"So I adopted my pup about a month ago. Everything is going great, he’s an awesome dog. We really lucked out on him. Plays well with dogs, kids, etc. 

My roommates and I are going on a road trip to a buddy’s cabin this weekend for New Years. I had a bunch of family over this past weekend and he did really well, so we’ve decided to take him with us, instead of leaving him at home. 

Every time he gets in the car, his whole demeanor changes. He’s all of the sudden really calm, drooling a ton, sometimes throws up, sometimes his breathing gets shallow. All the signs of anxiety and needing the throw up. I already went to one vet and they weren’t any help. I’m going to be taking him to another vet at the start of the year for a wellness exam, and to address any issues we’re having, once we get to know normal a little better. 

The car ride is 3 1/2 hours. He doesn’t seem to want to chew during car rides, he just seems to accept that he’s going to throw up. We have tried on the floor in the backseat, on the backseat, and in the front seat. It doesn’t seem to make a difference. Time also doesn’t seem to matter. I took him on an hour car ride once, he was GREAT. Last week I took him 20 minutes away and he puked on the way home. 

Any tips or tricks that you’ve tried that help, please let me know. "
12,[Help] How do you train a dog with EPI?,dogs,t3_aa1ud5,4,False,False,aa1ud5,"This weekend I'm making a 6 hour trip to rescue a 2 year old GSD mix with EPI. I understand the general feeding, b12-injections, and constant vigilance. I still have a lot to learn about the condition, but overall feel pretty prepared. I do, however, have one area of concern. How am I supposed to train her without giving her treats? I have an Aussie/GSD that I've had a lot of success training using a clicker and high value treats, but can't figure out how to translate that for a dog that (probably?) can't have treats."
13,[Help] Older rescue seems miserably bored but won't play,dogs,t3_aa0x3m,8,False,False,aa0x3m,"Hello all! Haven't posted on reddit in years so hoping this is all within this subs rules...

&amp;#x200B;

I have a +/- 10 year old rescue brussels griffon, who my husband rescued before we met and it was estimated he was around 5 at that time. We have speculated that he was very likely a stud, as his features are purebred, he was not fixed (at \~5yo) when he was found, he has a clearly abusive history/PTSD, and he didn't know how to use stairs, a harness, or act like a ""dog"" (barely still does).

&amp;#x200B;

He's come A LONG LONG way and we're so proud of him, but now that he's happier and healthier, he's much spunkier and seems to be needing something that we cannot figure out  / don't know how to give him.

&amp;#x200B;

An attempt at a long-story-short: he never learned how to play and won't play, but is bored to death all of the time it seems like. He doesn't care about toys (but also doesn't have enough teeth to use them anyway) and is not really smart enough (sorry little guy) to fetch or anything of the like. He's food-motivated but only for meals (kongs w/ peanut butter, etc, have failed and his face is too flat for food mazes, he'd just starve.... ), and leaving him with food-motivated toys only results in him pooping or peeing on them (he's only housebroken when you're home... joys of a rescue). We don't have a yard right now and are not allowed to get another dog in our place... we've been looking to move FOR his sake specifically, but it's been unrealistic so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly, the only way we've ever been able to figure out he likes to ""play"" is for him to stand vaguely out of reach from you and bark. That's it. He doesn't/won't stray from us at off-leash parks and he doesn't care at all about other dogs. He's not smart enough (or simply not interested enough) in doing anything like nose-training (and tbh I'm not sure his senses are good enough for anything like that either). Sadly we can't afford doggie daycare and don't have any friends with dogs to go on dates with, and no friends who can stop by to get some energy out who are available or nearby....

&amp;#x200B;

He's often sighing heavily and constantly fidgeting (not in pain, had that checked out....) and is very dramatic during the night standing up and collapsing down onto the hardwoods when people are trying so sleep, clearly indicating he is antsy. All I can think of is to just walk/run him harder but he's fickle about that (particularly in inclement weather, in seattle), and that's not very ""fun"" either really.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just wondering/hoping anyone might have any behavioral insight or suggestions who know more about this than we do? Poor guy seems miserable and giving scritches/pets/love is just not cutting it. Thank you so much!!

14,[Help] Neverending allergies and concurrent infections; our pup is suffering.,dogs,t3_aa1of8,15,False,False,aa1of8,"\[Help\]  My husband and I rescued my dog, an AmStaff, 1.5 years ago and he's currently 3.5 years old.  He had red paws and itchiness when we first got him, which was diagnosed as allergies by our first, local vet.  This began our neverending battle with allergic reactions and skin infections. (He turns tomato red, licks constantly, has broken skin w/ pustules at times, and often carries concurrent infections. Sometimes I wonder if the skin infection is truly a by-product of the allergic reactions or if he has an ongoing infection separately and in addition to his allergies.) The thing is, his issues have gotten exponentially worse with time.  Last winter he was fairly decent, but this winter he is miserable without some combination of ketoconazole (antifungal), apoquel, and cephalexin (antibiotic) and, sometimes, even when medicated he is still bright red and absolutely miserable.  The vets claim it's because he's allergic to non-seasonal triggers (mold, food) but that doesn't seem plausible to me, because then he would have reacted similarly last year, no? We've seen 4 vets and they all give the same advice (more drugs, more drugs, more drugs) but I've had my own experiences with constant antibiotic/medication use and know first-hand the repercussions.  I cringe every time I give him his medicine at this point and am emotionally exhausted from seeing him suffer and feeling powerless to help. We've had him allergy-tested and he's allergic to so much that I feel like he might have immune confusion, histamine intolerance and/or mast cell activation disorder; vets don't seem to want to entertain that possibility though. Here's a list of what we've tried and/or are currently trying:

* Specialized diet (removed offending foods; fed only freeze-dried and frozen raw)
* Allergy-testing (allergic to many proteins and peas, along with grasses, trees, weeds, and some molds)
* Low-dose immunotherapy shots and sublinguals (started with shots - total nightmare, so switched to sublinguals; over-reacted to the triggers so took him off it)
* Apoquel  (as needed; makes him lethargic and cuts allergic response in half)
* Antibiotics (specifically cephalexin, aka keflex; so many rounds I can't count)
* Ketoconazole (antifungal; daily - absolutely terrible for his liver)
* Medicated shampoos (once weekly; seems to temporarily kill bacteria and yeast but also irritates his already damaged skin)
* Non-histamine producing probiotics (daily)
* S. Boulardii probiotic when not taking Ketoconazole to see if that would reduce yeast issues (didn't notice a difference)
* Digestive enzymes (daily)
* Immune support supplement ([Thorne's Immugen](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/immugen-reg) for dogs)
* Kidney glandular supplements (for DAO supplementation to reduce histamine; no noticeable improvement)
* [Histoplex supplement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073G7N2G5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) by Biotics Research (no noticeable difference)
* Betadine spray and liquid betadine for his skin (seems to help but it stings and he hates it)
* Quercetin w/ Bromelain (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Benadryl and Quercetin (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Pollock Oil (anti-inflammatory; improvement in coat and skin but not irritation/reaction)
* CBD oil for inflammation and discomfort (just started)
* Redonyl Ultra (just started; contains PEA and omegas; hoping it stabilizes mast cells and helps his skin)

I'm sure I'm missing something but this is where we're at.  Any help at all would be much appreciated.  We're so desperate at this point. :-(   Thanks, everyone.

15,[HELP] Dog suddenly behaving strange around 10 month old baby... unsure what to think.,dogs,t3_aa1m80,5,False,False,aa1m80,"Our 7 year old terrier mix has always been super sweet with our new addition - kept his distance most of the time but would come by with the occasional lick and tail wag, and would lay in her room as I put her down for a nap. Baby's now nearly 10 months and crawling and walking with a push toy like crazy, and suddenly I have a weird feeling about his behavior towards her. He follows her around when she's walking and gets up in her face to lick her and if I call him to sit on the couch and leave her alone he watches her like a hawk. I can't tell if it's just cute protectiveness or if I should be worried that her new mobility is causing him to, I dunno, feel more dominant? He's also been more clingy with me, following me around the house and sitting next to me all the time. Perhaps the two are related... some sort of newfound jealousy?

I suppose I should be 100% transparent and admit he's had aggression issues before with other dogs and strangers (mostly mailmen). We've been extra super cautious with the two of them because of his history, and as of just a couple days ago he's never displayed any sort of worrisome behaviors towards the baby ( I wonder if I'm being paranoid because of past issues?)

Are there any behaviors in particular I should keep an eye out for? I NEVER allow them to be alone together of course, but everything I search about ""issues with dogs licking baby's face"" seems to be about germs whereas I'm more concerned about him becoming aggressive towards her.

Any insight is appreciated."
16,[Breeds] What breeds would be right for me?,dogs,t3_aa1kjj,1,False,False,aa1kjj,"Hi r/dogs! I am currently a grad student and could not take care of a doggo right now. Being a (good) dog owner is definitely a goal in my life so I wanted to be a bit proactive now, and look into what companion would be best for me in 2-3 years..

**Introduction**

 * *Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?* 

Yes! I have no experience.

* *Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?*

 I would prefer going through a reputable breeder, especially since I might be interested in showing my dog.

* *Describe your ideal dog.* 

I would like my dog to be my companion. They would be fairly easily trained and more on the quiet side. I'd like them to be playful without being overly excited.

* *What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?* 

I live in a small apartment so toy breeds are definitely what I am looking into. Most of my family is in Europe and I like that I could bring my dog with me in the cabin when flying (I think the max. weight is 16lbs?). I was interested in long-coated Chihuahuas especially. I loved the look of toy Eskies but I hear they love to bark, which my neighbours would never forgive me for, same for Pomeranians. I also liked Italian Greyhounds. In any case I am open to suggestions!

* *What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?* 

Definitely basic obedience. Like I mentioned, if they can, I think it might be fun to go to dog shows - I really like the idea of my dog and I having our own special activity. Later on I might be interested in fostering seeing-eye dogs in training, so a dog that can get along with other dogs would be ideal.

**Care Commitments**

*  *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*  

I don't have an clear idea of what my dog would need in terms of training, but I thought I would be interacting with him pretty much constantly when at home.


*  *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?* 

I would like a total of 90 minutes/day split into maybe 2-3 walks, or smaller walks + going to the dog park. I also want my dog to either go to daycare during workdays, or at least be visited my a walker once a day.

*  *How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?* 

I am open to it completely, I hope my dog can be too! I would rather avoid going to a professional and save money that way.

**Personal Preferences**

  *  *What size dog are you looking for?* 

A mini one! Definitely toy or a small breed.

*  *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?* 

Medium shedding, although these are things can be dealt with. I am much less open to barking, so minimal barking.

* *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?* 

Not very. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

  *  *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?* 

Very much a snuggly one, otherwise I'd get a cat XD. I do worry about separation anxiety though..

  *  *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?* 

 Since I am a beginner, I think an eager-to-please dog would be easier for me, although there are limits - didn't someone post about their dog pooing to please them?? XD Yeah, I'd rather not, thanks dog.

  *  *How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?* 

By coming to me first I guess? With some curiosity but not bother visitors.

 * *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?* 

No. I don't know what I could do if my dog were aggressive in daycare for example..

  *  *Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?* 

Barking is the big one, I guess things like puppy biting and walking on a leash can be taught or addressed so I can't think of anything else.

**Lifestyle**

  * *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?* 

I am very much looking for remote positions but I will most probably work 9-5 so doggo would be left alone 4 hours before being walked, and 4 hours before I come home. I am looking into daycares.

  *  *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?* I will be the sole caretaker of the dog.

  *  *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?* 

I want to foster seeing-eye puppies in the future, or at least get other dogs.

 *  *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?* No.

  *  *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?* 

Yes, I rent. There are no specific restrictions but the dog should be well-behaved. I think having an obedience certificate might be an asset but that is just my opinion. In the future, if the gods smile upon me and I am able to ever afford a house, you bet I'd like big dogs.

  *  *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?* 

I am currently in Montreal, Canada, but I may move upon graduation. The city currently taxes pitbull owners.

  *  *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?* 

Summer: 25-28 Celsius or 77-82 Fahrenheit although climate change is hitting us hard and we had weeks at 35-42°C or 95-107°F. Winter: 0°C to - 20°C or 32°F to -4°F

**Additional Information and Questions**

  *  *Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.* I don't have a car, and don't plan on getting one. 

   * * Feel free to ask any questions below.*
I would like to know how much daycare is costing you guys, or if you have tips on finding reputable breeders and dog walkers.. I am curious to hear all your experiences and feedback! Thanks for reading all of this!

Any suggestions from you folks? Open to anything that isn't chicken/beef based. He won't eat it.

For the past couple of days, he doesn't eat much, barely drinks water, can't stand up or move on his own (he has been very unsteady on his feet for the past 4-5 months or so, but he was able to at least walk) and doesn't really react when we call his name. Nevertheless, he still barks semi-regularly and responds when we pet him. 

Although he doesn't explicitly express it by whimpering or anything like that, I think that he is in deep pain due to his condition (I've read that bone cancer can be extremely painful) and am looking for more information on whether the lameness and tiredness he is expressing is tied to his feeling unwell or his pain.

20,[Breeds] Am I a stupid idiot for wanting a German Sheperd as my first dog post-phobia?,dogs,t3_aa2isp,10,False,False,aa2isp,"Hey all,

So 2016 - 2018 was the two-year period where I kicked my phobia of dog's ass - note, I didn't kick the ass of any dogs during this period, that would be awful - and now I'm at the point where I can confidently be around dogs and it's like I'm not even around em. I've been looking into dogs, and I think a German Sheperd would be a good choice.

Here are some facts that might be helpful for you guys:

I'm 18, but I won't be going to college (called University here in the UK) for a good two years, maybe even three, and all I'm doing is my post-high school study called A levels. This means that I have a lot of time to devote to dog walking, training, all that.

I am financially stable as I saved a lot of money from when I wasn't in education and I receive a monthly sum anyways. This means that I am certainly not unable to provide for the dog.

I have a lot of space - I live in a three bedroom house with a garden, and one of the bedrooms is unused, as well as the dining room. 

I hear that German Sheperds are quite clingy and love to be around family, which I think would be a lot of fun as I can 100% provide the time commitments (practically) all year around. If I was to get a GS, I would choose my University accomondation accordingly; I want to make it clear to you guys that I am fully committed to raising the dog!

EDIT: I'd like to point out that I just realised that I have a very active lifestyle that might really benefit a GS - I follow a military routine (long story, not in the Army atm but I really enjoyed the training haha), this includes sprinting on some days, running every day; generally good cardio stuff that (I'm pretty sure) the dog would enjoy.

I don't live with babies or small children. I live with my dad who is a warehouse worker who is constantly active, and my brother who isn't around too much.

QUESTIONAIRRE:

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Zero dog experience, but I love the buggers now that I got over the phobia. First dog, but not the first dog in the family - my dad had a dog growing up.


2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?


* No preference.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.


* Loyal, physical enough that I can have fun with it when I go out on runs and the like, protective.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* GS, they look adorable and I would like a tough yet loving dog. They seem very loyal too.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Guard-type stuff, but I may be able to get in touch with my friend who is a K9 trainer in the Army (the lucky git)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Literally as much as I need. I'm out monday-friday from 9AM to 5PM, but the evening is the dogs, and so is the weekend. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* See my main post, I do a lot of cardio and strength exercises outdoors and this seems like perfect GS territory.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Totally open to that! We have HEPA air filters at my house that are rated for dogs so I don't even need to worry about annoying hairs, and no one has allergies either :)

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

*Medium - big. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*Infinite, haha. I think it goes with the territory of owning a GS.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*Not important, but if I had to do that I wouldn't mind!

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

*Is there such a thing as a mixture of both? I'd lead more toward snuggly though.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

*Eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

*Wouldn't mind them making noise when someone knocks on the door. We rarely get visitors but it would be nice if they were friendly with them up to a certain level.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*Yep!

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
Nothing that comes to mind as long as it isn't biting me a lot haha

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

*9 AM to 5PM when I'm at college, 9 AM to 3PM on Tuesdays. Family will be in but they have less dog experience.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

*Family are indifferent, but they'd feed the dog if needed.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*I mean, I might get a goldfish or something at some point, but no other four-legged friends!

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

*No. Very, very rarely - if ever.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

*No restrictions on dogs where I live, and I'll actually cater renting my Uni dwellings around the dog.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*UK, and the only restrictions are on the ""killer breeds"" that are bred to be violent; GS doesn't count.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*Summer days - Highs of 22 degrees celsius and lows of 11. Roughly 70 deg fahrenheit high and 51 degree low.

*Winter days - Really depends as the UK has a weird climate. Lows of -1 C (30 F) and highs of 7 or 8 (45 degrees) depending on the day. Lots and lots of rain though."
21,[Help] my dog starts barking randomly in the morning,dogs,t3_aa2hmk,8,False,False,aa2hmk,"For the past 2 to 3 weeks, my dog starts randomly barking in the early morning, 5 AM, 6 or 7 usually, don't know what causes it, but it's driving my parents around the bend, what can be done to get him to stop? My parents have been talking about giving him away and I don't want to lose him."
22,[Help] Housemates beginning to not get along.,dogs,t3_a9zvzr,11,False,False,a9zvzr,"First post here, but I'm stumped as to how to advise my parents on their dogs. Sorry if I'm a little disjointed or if the formatting is off, there's a bit to unpack here. 

   A little bit of background: They have two dogs (and one cat). Both dogs are the same breed (American Bulldog) and sex (female), but differ in age. The older dog is around 7, the younger dog is nearing 2. Older Dog came from a shady breeder as the runt and we suspect she was abused before we got her, although it doesn't seem to affect her regarding aggression towards people or other dogs. She plays well with others and is very much a people pleaser. 

   Younger dog on the other hand, is a little...off. She came from much better beginnings than older dog, but has ended up with a mild form of congenital ataxia. Whereas older dog was a very easy to train dog, younger dog is slow to pick up commands and very hardheaded. Younger dog also is very easily scared, but will respond with aggression. (Example: Her and older dog on a play date with another dog, Younger dog took a potshot she almost regretted but Older Dog stepped in and defended her until people came to break them up.)

&amp;#x200B;

We've been noticing a disturbing trend between the two dogs though. Younger dog is starting to pick fights with the older dog. Older dog will do her best to try to prevent a fight, but Younger dog is so bullheaded that she keeps on until Older Dog can't take it anymore. Fights will erupt (all instigated by the younger dog) over affection, food, toys, and occasionally an unknown stimulus. Older dog will give younger dog a wide berth because she doesn't want to fight (doesn't like making my mom or dad upset) and will avoid as much as she can until she can't. 

Usually when a fight erupts it's after Younger Dog stares down Older Dog (with Older Dog avoiding looking at her). Younger Dog will take a potshot, and then it's on. Older Dog, despite being avoidant, will throw down when she has to. The fight I witnessed happened behind me after I gave older dog some attention. Younger dog stared down and took her shot, tried to take older dog down and got grounded by Older Dog. Older dog will not clamp down to draw blood, but will pin Younger dog down by the throat until she stops fighting. However, the second Older Dog releases, Younger dog is right back up snapping and snarling until Older Dog puts her down again. 

This is different from their play fights. I feel this is a challenge situation over resources (including affection). But we don't know what to do about it. I'm not so worried about having to break them up because for now fights are only occurring when people are home. My concern is what will happen if a fight breaks out and nobody is home. I don't think Younger Dog will stop. I think she'll keep on and keep on until both of them are tired or one of them wins. And I feel bad for the older dog as well. She shouldn't be slinking around the house hiding and trying to avoid a fight from the younger dog because she was there first. My Mom has thought about rehoming the Younger Dog, but is worried that with her ataxia (mild as it is, she's just forever going to be a little clumsy like a puppy with paws too big for their legs) rehoming will be hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to tell them. I did tell mom it wouldn't be as hard as she thinks to rehome for such a mild neurological issue, but I understand that she would rather find a way to solve the issue in the house. All issues aside, Younger dog can be incredibly sweet. None of us like how it's affecting Older dog though, because this was her home first. 

Is there anyone else that has had experience with this issue? What did you do to remedy it? Or is rehoming the only answer?

Anyway, none of my pets left. Including the cat! My youngest has just figured out on his own that you always stay in the yard.

33,[Help] My senior dog is having a very bad post seizure recovery and is extremely hungry,dogs,t3_aa22bc,1,False,False,aa22bc,"My 13 year old pug started having seizures when she was around 9, they lasted about 30 seconds and she was perfectly normal right after. 

Two months ago she started having grand mal seizures that lasted about 3 minutes and were quite violent with a recover period of about 2-3 hours of disorientation. I started her on CBD oil and didn't have a seizure for a month. I switched to a pet specific one and I think the dosage was lower and I didn't realize I was only giving her 2.5mg instead of 5mg (20lb dog). She started having seizures again. Had 4 in one day and no amount of CBD seemed to help so I brought her to the emerg vet who gave me phenobarbital and gabapentin.

This was 24 hours ago and her seizures have stopped but her recovery phase is much much worse. She's been just screaming for the past 20 hours and her back legs barely work now. She's ravenously hungry, which I've read is fairly normal post seizure. But I think the screaming is from how hungry she is. I went to my regular vet to get something to sedate her because this dog usually sleeps 15 hours a day but has had maybe 4 hours of sleep. She was given valium and it helped her sleep for maybe 2 hours before she woke up and started screaming again. Food is the only thing that calms her down and she eats it like she's been starved. When I touch her, she sniffs my hand to see if I have food and will nibble a bit on anything around her mouth.

I'm worried it's all neurological and no amount of food with satiate her. I don't want to over feed her but I wonder how much can I give. After the first few seizures, she was running around constantly. 

I just want her to get some rest have to have the screaming stop. Has anyone had a similar experience?

TL;DR Dog had 4 bad seizures in one day. Is on phenobarbital and valium for it now and the seizures have stopped but she's screaming constantly and I think it's from hunger. Is it safe to over feed her or should I be doing something else to sooth her?"
34,[Help] Talking to someone about their aggressive dog.,dogs,t3_aa1xzz,3,False,False,aa1xzz,"I have another post going in r/relationships that describes the issue in more detail, but to sum it up, my brother has a dog with bad fear-aggression and it frequently bites other people. I'm wondering if there's any advice from the dog owner's perspective that I could give to him.

To tell you some more about the dog's background:

Sadie is about 8 years old and is some kind of chihuahua-terrier mix, she's about 25 lbs. He and his wife adopted her about 6 years ago and at adoption time, she already came with her various behavior problems. These include excessive barking, resource guarding, leash reactivity and fear-aggression that results in bites intended to injure others. Sadie does not growl, snap or give any other obvious warning signs before she attacks.

My brother's wife is the root problem, in my opinion, because Sadie is extremely protective of her. Most of the bites are directed at people or animals who come too close to the wife for Sadie's comfort. The wife does most of the feeding, walking, etc. and is constantly giving Sadie treats, comforting her when she's scared, talking to her when she barks, and holding her when she is acting afraid or aggressive.

Things they've tried for Sadie:

* Hired a trainer - they had a few sessions with a trainer and saw some improvement with Sadie. The trainer then said that Sadie has some serious behavior problems and they should strongly consider bringing her to a veterinary behaviorist for further treatment. Wife fired the trainer after this.
* Dog-dog socialization - Sadie is aggressive to other dogs so she can't go to the dog park and she can't pack-walk. She has no dog friends.
* Anti-bark collar - They ordered one and never took it out of the box.
* Muzzle (the velcro style, not basket style) - They ordered one and never took it out of the box.
* Crate - They ordered one and set it up but Sadie doesn't go in it.

Throughout the years I've also mentioned some things like trying a training book or some videos, consulting with another trainer again, other tips on behavior modification etc. and the wife shuts it down every time, saying ""That kind of stuff doesn't work for Sadie."" I know the wife is often frustrated with Sadie's behavior, in particular the non-stop barking, but she is apparently not willing to try anything different.

My question for dog owners is in two parts:

* Question 1, is there any hope to try training a dog like this? It's gone on for years so I'm not sure any change can really be made at this point, and maybe all we can do is just insist that Sadie stay home and away from others.
* Question 2, if someone ever spoke to you about your dog's behavior, what worked in that case? What kind of statements made sense and what kind of statements threw you off?

**TL,DR: Brother and his wife have an aggressive dog that bites, I need to talk to them about this, looking for perspective from other dog owners on how they might prefer to receive feedback about their dog's behavior from others.**"
35,[Help] The Worst Start to Owning a Puppy Ive Ever Had (on the verge of a breakdown).,dogs,t3_aa1qnt,11,False,False,aa1qnt,"I've always grown up owning dogs. I firmly believe man should grow with a dog to some extent. I recently became a licensed nurse, started making more, and finally got to a point where I could own a dog. A puppy even, if I made the needed adjustments. I work out as much as I can throughout the week, so the dog could get plenty of exercise under my care. Seriously I had thought of all the necessary provisions, dog sitters, food, researched breeds, kept tabs on the market, etc. I had it all planned out. Even though I work night shift mostly, I could make it work. I refuse to believe that I can't do this just because I'm single living in a 2bed apartment. And when he gets older, I can always drop him off at my mom's omw to work bc she has a huge backyard and that would be good for him to stretch his legs during the hours I work.

My sister, who lives in Denver, finds a puppy she wants out in the state I live. She asks me to get it for her and she will venmo me the money. It's a Boston terrier pup. Cute Lil thing, but he adjusted extremely well. I was able to play with the pup, attempted to train here and there, and even had a dog sitter for it. Now, the breeder I'm buying from fails to mention he will be out the day I wanna buy the dog, so now I'm pressed to buy sooner. I buy him yesterday early morning thinking I'm gonna have all day and night with the pups and then I'd have a dog sitter for the next day. His name is Roy and he's a border collie.

11:00pm rolls around last night (12/26/18) and I get a call from my work, ""where are you? You're supposed to be here."" Apparently, my schedule was changed without my knowing. Now I'm in full blown panic mode. What the hell do I do now? I start calling ppl up left n right, hitting up dog sitters via Rover - nothing. I tell my date that I had earlier that day (I didn't leave the two pups alone for more than an hour btw) my situation, not realizing she would volunteer to help. So she says she will take care of them for the night at her place. Not ideal, but I can't deny that opportunity. So I do this. Now I have them back, trying to get some sleep before I have to work a freaking double from 3pm to 7am which was also scheduled without my knowing. Now I'm on the verge of a complete breakdown. I haven't been able to give Roy a good couple of days all bc of some bs with work and I'm thinking this will dramatically affect him. I can't get him to use puppy pads and I wasn't able to introduce the crate to him in a positive way at all. Idk what to do and I feel like I'm overwhelmed and drowning. Like I'm genuinely about to cry and freak out bc I didn't plan on it being so rough for Roy. For the record, the Boston terrier is named Austin and he's been doing really well, but Roy isn't. I put them both in the same kennel (it's a large kennel) to see if it would help Roy but it doesn't. He is constantly freaking out like how I am right now lol. Idk if I'm going to be able to keep up. How fucked up is this situation and am I being too dramatic here? Should I call the breeder and send the puppy back bc I am on total freak out mode and suddenly feel like I cant do this anymore. Like Roy had such a bad first day that I feel I  can't even repair whatever trauma he may or may not have undergone moving around so much."

He likes to run beside my when I go biking and running but when it comes to playing with balls or sticks or anything he just doesn't participate.

37,[Help] My dogs dick is always out. What can I do?,dogs,t3_aa1pfd,2,False,False,aa1pfd,"Hey guys! So, I have a 4 year old Shih Tuz Yorkie named Beans, I love him and he’s great even though he has his moments. For some reason his dick is always out. Sometimes it’s just the tip other times it’s a good inch. Whenever people meet him I can tell it makes them uncomfortable. Even I think it’s gross and awkward when it’s just out, I’ll say “Beans, put your dick away you perv”, I get no response.  He’s a really cute dog so I get a lot of people who want to meet him and cuddle with him. I’ve taken him to the vet twice, payed 40$ for the vet to just flip his skin back over his dick.  Which was pointless because when we got home it was out again! I cut the hairs around his dick Incase they were getting in the way of him pulling it back in. That maybe him licking himself was to try and lubreacte it or something. I tell him to stop every time I see him licking himself and then don’t make eye contact. Sometimes, like if it’s really cold or for some unknown reason, he puts it away but only for a few hours. I don’t remember if he’s always been like this, he’s my first dog so maybe I just thought it was normal at first. I don’t know what else I can do since the vet hasn’t really been helpful.

41,[Help] Is it ever too late to train a dog not to bark?,dogs,t3_aa18zi,3,False,False,aa18zi,"Hello!

My 2,5 year old dog (terrier/pinscher mix) barks a lot, especially outside at other dogs and I am overchallenged with it. I am suffering from social anxiety and the looks people give you when your dog is barking is really too much for me and I don't like it when other people make a mean comment regarding my dog, since I truly love her and of course don't want anyone to insult her. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory: My mom and I got the dog together but she mostly had her and was basically the ""pack leader"". Our girl was always way more quiet when I had her and when she barked my mother only rant at her until she stopped. Over the years it got more and more out of control and we got a muzzle which I kept using when she barked and it was really a help. My mother wasn't using it though because ""she looked so awful"" with it. We often kept fighting about it but she never really used it. 

Well now my mom isn't there anymore (not dead) and I have the dog alone and she is seeing me as her leader now. While she isn't barking much at home, she basically always barks at other dogs outside. At home I can easily use the muzzle and I really see that it is helping, but outside it's different. When we see another dog I always try to change the street or something but sadly that's not always possible and honestly I rather want to solve the problem now and not just runaway from it. 

Now you're probably wondering why I don't use the muzzle outside - my dog isn't walking when she wears it. At home she is moving a little bit like getting on the bed and walking towards me but if we are outside she doesn't even walk if I pull the leash a bit. She is just standing there and I'd basically had to drag her behind me to get her going, but of course that's not the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be very thankful for any help and advice since it's taking a toll on my social anxiety and I'd really like my dog and me to have a good time outside."
42,[help] what should we be looking for in a rescue/rescue dog?,dogs,t3_aa17l1,23,False,False,aa17l1,"TL;DR: are we asking too much for a rescue dog from a North West shelter? Dogs that fit this description are gone within the day and rescues keep sticking their nose up at us. Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog. 

Our wishlist for a dog: prefer small but only needs to be under 120 lbs (apartment restriction), cannot be a pit, gsd, or husky, must get along with other dogs and people, energetic and athletic, between 1 to 4 years old,

Sorry for the wall of text. This started as a question and has kind of turned into a vent with hope for advice.

So my husband and I are looking at getting another dog. We are having serious issues with finding a compatible dog and I am wondering if we are just asking too much or if we are just not looking in the right places.

Background: We are both from the south but are in the North West. We are definitely having a problem getting use to a completely different culture surrounding dog adoption. We are use to having tons of good dogs looking for adoption for anywhere from $25 to $100. Here the cheapest county shelter is $250, private groups start at $500, and the dogs are gone within a day or two.

We have decided to get an adult dog from a shelter for the ease and to skip the terrible puppy  stage. I have only ever had a dog I raised from puppyhood. My husband has never had a puppy and got his dogs as adults, but they also only had one dog at a time and the dogs were outdoor only dogs.

We have a 7 year old border collie mix who has lived with as many as 5 other dogs in a house and has never had any serious issues with any of them. She will never start fights, however, she won't run away when attacked either.

Problem: we have been looking at dogs since September and cannot seem to find a good match. We did adopt one dog in September but as soon as she became comfortable in the house it became apparent she was large dog/fear aggressive and would constantly attack our current dog (mostly over resources and proximity). This led to us returning her for fear that we end up having an ER visit or worse due to the fights (it got very close to needing an ER visit twice in the month we had her). It was a costly mistake as her adoption price was $575 and the rescue group black listed us because ""we didn't know how to handle dog with issues"". This rescue organization came highly recommend and they told us this dog ""didn't have an aggressive bone in her body"". They made no mention of issues before we adopted her but when I reached out to ask how to calm her down and get her more relaxed they told me ""she just needs time, she started fights when she first got here too"".

We decided to be more cautious, we have been more attuned to how our dog greets the other dog, how the rescue/shelter is organized, and really looking at the dog's personality. But so far we are always late and the dog is gone before we have made a decision on the dog.

We have also been avoided by a lot of rescues because we are young, in an apartment, and looking for a high energy dog. Our current dog is high energy and we really enjoy that energy level because we enjoy walking (walk a minimum of 2 30 minute walks a day), hiking, and are generally athletic people. I would also really like to get into dog sports. But the rescues always turn us to old, low energy dogs.I am really about to say let's save up and get a purebred puppy at this point even tho I hate the puppy phase.

Just in case you forgot (again sorry for the wall of text) the question is So are we asking too much? Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog.

43,[help] Is it possible my dog broke his nose?,dogs,t3_aa156v,2,False,False,aa156v,"Hey,

  I have two rat terriers and one was wrapped in a blanket and the other started barking so he jumped down with the blanket over his body and would up running straight into a wooden chest. I ran over and unwrapped him and he was sneezing really hard really fast and he nose was absolutely off center. It’s been a few minutes and the sneezing has mostly stopped, occasional sneeze or half sneeze/trying to kind of thing. His nose now appears straight and I can lightly move it around with no yelping or hard pulling away or anything. 

  Think he’s fine ? He really didn’t even hit the chest hard I think he just went nose first and he’s got a pointy snout "
44,[Help] Which breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_aa144t,2,False,False,aa144t,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It would be the first dog we own. I have an uncle that owned and trained several Rottweilers and German-Shepards. So I was often around dogs in my life. Also walked them and played with them etc.

My wife was also around dogs as a child but never owned one.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We would love to rescue a dog. However, depending on the breed we heard that one needs to be careful with rescue dogs. The uncle I mentioned above recommend me to not get a rescue dogs as ""you can get a lot of baggage you do not know about"".

Any additional advice from you would be very welcome.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

A companion that loves being around my wife an me. He should be able to spend time with either me or my wife without ""missing"" the other too much.

He should be be able to hang on the couch for some time but also love walks/hikes/jogging and should not have problems with other dogs or children. We are not looking for a guard dog. However, there are a lot of children and other dogs around our neighbourhood.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I always likes Labradors, however we might think that they might be too big for a first time dog. I hear a lot of recommendation for this one as a first time/family dog. I also have a thing for Welsh Corgis. I understand that they might be very active.

We both find Beagles could fit us very well.

My wife likes Dachshunds and other smaller breeds. She would prefer a dog that she can lift up if the situation requires it.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Walking along side us, fetch, sit, speak/quite. The usual I guess. Nothing too exotic I think.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1 hour should be possible every day. More on the weekends.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I think 30mins each day are possible. We both jog every other day. So the dog would come with us. On the off days we would go for walks or play fetch in the yard.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We would prefer a shorter coat. If necessary all grooming will be done for the dog. A professional would be used if totally necessary but is not preferred.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and Slobber can be handled a lot. The neighbours would probably prefer the barking to be at minimum. However, they also have dogs and they sometimes bark too.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

We would love to let the dog run free in safe area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly most of the time.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Is ""somewhere in between"" a possible answer? 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

As mentioned, we are not looking for a guard dog. Knocking at doors should preferably not be a problem. If someone enters the yard, it would be good if he barks.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Would be great if the dog does not like to eat shoes, cables or tv remotes. But hey...thats just something you have to deal with when owning a dog.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home about 90%. On the days that I would not be at home, my wife could take the dog to work with her. I neither works, the dog would stay in the yard for about 8 hours. However, I cannot imagine that happening very often. 

If we would be gone for longer, my parents can take care of the dog. They also have a big yard.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My wife loves dogs and wants one too. We would share the involvement 50/50.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not at the moment. We might be expecting our first child in 1-2 years.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We own a house with a yard in the suburbs. No intention of renting.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in Graz, Austria. No specific restrictions come to mind.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer 25 to 30 degrees celcius
Winter 5 to -10 degrees celcius

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We have a fenced yard that is about 120 square metres big.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

What do you guys think is the one thing that most newbies do not think about when getting a dog? We try to prepare as good as possible."
45,"[Discussion] Wow, kids be dumb. Parents need to do their job.",dogs,t3_a9pn7u,58,False,False,a9pn7u,"Christmas was interesting for our 3-month-old pup. He has met kids before when we take him to the park, but this week he met the family kids (ages 7-10). I thought they would be at least a little knowledgeable about how to behave with a dog because they all have their own. I definitely overestimated there.
 
The kids don't listen. The first thing they did was run screaming down the street towards me and the puppy. I held up my hand and yelled to stop and slow down. Kids continued and parents did nothing. 
 
Playing with my puppy involved chasing him, encouraging him to bite their hands and feet, backing him into corners, getting all up in his face... I tried so many times to stop the kids and explain that they needed to let pup get to know them, let him sniff them, etc and don't invade his personal space. I tried to teach them about his body language and when it means they should back off. They didn't adjust their behavior and I had to babysit.
 
Kids be dumb. One asked, ""How come he won't let me pet his belly?"" I'm like, ""How would you feel if someone you just met came up to you and rolled you onto your back to rub your belly?"" Didn't make the connection.
 
We went outside to walk pup after dinner. Kid comes with us. He's like, ""Are we gonna run him around soon? Cuz I'm getting bored."" I'm like, ""We're not out here to entertain you wtf?""
 
Most of my last two days have just been a stressful mess of me having to take my puppy away from the kids to protect him. Or getting discipliny with them because their parents are off having fun.
 
People kept asking me, why don't I take him off the leash inside? 1) because he is 3 months old and doesn't know how to stay alive and 2) the kids harass him.
 
I try to put pup down in his crate for naps and the kids come bursting in like ""NOOO why are you putting him in a cage??"" He's safe in there and it's naptime. How about someone put you in a cage."

Our in-laws love him but dont worry about or accept the same risks as us. For instance they let him out freely in the back yard (fenced) which concerns me because he likes to eat EVERYTHING. They don’t even crate him because my mother IL says it’s cruel to see dogs in crates, even after explaining how it works. We’ve never used the crate for punishment and at home, he even voluntarily goes in at bed time.

After the two times he has spent the night there, he’s refused to eat food for about 2 days. Could this be a stress response in reaction to not being in the crate or off his routine?"

I have no intention of trying to tell you how to teach your kids, but as a warning. My Husky is very easy going and I wasn't necessarily worried when it did happen, but you might not be so lucky with another dog. I had both my dogs unleashed at an off leash park with no one around and I was about 15 ft away when my husky was doing his business. He likes a little privacy when he goes #2. Right in the middle of his dump a small child screams ""husky"" out of nowhere and runs directly for him. Before I could even get to him the child was already petting him and running off before I could even say a word. Luckily my shepherd isn't to keen on small children so she just avoids them by going the opposite direction. I understand dogs are the best thing when you're a child, but you never know what is going to happen. Next time they might not meet a well mannered pup who loves kids, next time they might accidentally surprise the dog and get nipped, next time they might get bitten badly. So please, for dog owners and parents alike, to avoid any sort of problem, please let your children know not to run up to a strange dog.

59,"[discussion] I think my friend is about to buy from a puppy mill, how can i best warn him?",dogs,t3_a9txaq,14,False,False,a9txaq,"Friend is looking for a puppy. He has his heart set on Australian Shepherds, and found one available nearby.

Some of the ""red flags"" I've picked up talking to him:

 * They're breeding ""mini"" Australian Shepherds. That alone put me on alert, at least.
 * I'm aware Australian Shepherds are a popular breed at the moment and fairly susceptible to this kind of thing to start with.
 * ""Breeder"" seems to only have one or a few pairs of dogs that they repeatedly breed, all parents live with the breeder both moms and dads.
 * hip/knee checks are limited to ""my local vet says the parents are good"" and I'm unsure about eye testing - all three are recommended by akc for Aussies.
 * Breeder has lied to him about what to expect from the breed. They told him a mini Australian Shepherd will be a ""great apartment dog"" and only need a short daily walk for exercise and no mention of mental stimulation at all. I'm not worried about his ability to exercise the dog, he's a fairly active guy, but intentionally misinforming your pup's new parent rubs me the wrong way.
 * He's having difficulty getting them to commit to a home visit for the puppies, so he can see them prior to pickup.
 * No wait list, no interview, no meeting. He saw an add, said ""do you have a puppy for me"" and they said yes.
 * The dogs are CHEAP. They're asking for $500 CAD for the puppies, when he States other breeders in the area (many of whom also sound shady) were asking for 1200-2k. Breeder claims that this and the previous two points are due to the fact this is her last litter and she's getting out of breeding, due to being older and having some health conditions.

I told him these are red flags, but I believe he's blinded by cute puppies, and the fact he can actually afford them. Is there any good explanation for even some of this, and if you're all as wary as I am, is there anything else I can do or say to change his mind? Puppy pickup wouldn't be for another two weeks I believe, so maybe there's time.

60,[Help] Breeders and health testing importance/transparency,dogs,t3_a9wcac,11,False,False,a9wcac,"I made a post a couple days ago asking for opinions on a particular breeder. This brought up a some questions for me regarding health testing. I had contacted and asked the breeder for documentation, or something similar, that I could see just so I could see if their dogs really were tested for PRA, MDR1, etc. I did not receive anything official from them besides reassurance that their results are accurate based on lineage (linage was not provided and I searched OFA but had no luck). Looking at other breeder sites I've seen some dogs that have a simple description like ""MDR1: normal/mutant,"" while others have full pedigrees and include registration numbers to make it easier to look up their dogs and such. Others mention the names/locations of doctors who have examined their dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

When contacting breeders what exactly is a good response when asking about health testing? Is official documentation (a record from OFA or some other form of documentation) the main way to validate health tests or is verbal conformation that they do health tests typically what you get (i.e. ""this dog is not a carrier for \_\_\_\_"") ?

My 9 week old puppy Harley is happy and healthy in general, she has just had her first round of vaccinations 8 days ago. I feed Harley a combination of puppy food and a soup I cook biweekly composed of chicken stock, carrots, potatoes, pumpkin, and cubed beef liver. 

A few days ago she was napping on my lap and when she got up my shorts felt wet. And since then I’ve been noticing she leaves a wet spot wherever she sleeps or rests. Also I’ve been noticing a discharge from her lady parts, like a milky slightly yellowish liquid. 

I will take her to the vet on the 2nd of January, when they reopen. But is there anything I can do now? I tried googling the issue but it doesn’t seem like a common problem. "
62,[help] Extreme shedding all of a sudden,dogs,t3_a9x67e,3,False,False,a9x67e,"3 months ago we rescued a pit bull/Bassett hound mix who is approximately 2 years old. We have been feeding him Merrick food since day one and he has shed very little. 

With the last bag of Merrick food we purchased, we noticed the kibbles were larger which was odd. I emailed Merrick about it and they advised that the food can vary because it is all natural. My dog has never puked, but he has puked twice since starting this bag. My main concern is out of nowhere he has been shedding a TON. If you pet him, you end up with a hand full of hair. He has no bald spots but is shedding a ton. I returned the bag and switched to Acana food. 

My fiancé gave him a bath today, the hair covered the tub and clogged the drain it was so bad. We are worried sick about our boy. 

The only other change in our home was a real Christmas tree, but he hasn’t gone really close to it or eaten any pines needles. We live in Illinois so the climate is cold when he goes outside, but from what I’m reading dogs don’t really shed their coats this time of year. 

He is still 100% himself and active and doesn’t seem sick at all. Loves his food and is playful. Should we just give it a few days to see if it was the food? Get him to a vet immediately? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you in advance.

64,[Help] 8 month old puppy isn’t confident and heavily relies on everything we do.,dogs,t3_a9orpv,21,False,False,a9orpv,"So the title may have been a little misleading, but I didn’t really understand how to word my issue. Basically, we got a puppy in June and we have had him since we was 5ish weeks old. He’s a small breed, and we tend to think that we’re pretty good puppy owners. Leo is usually around other humans for roughly 20% of the day considering we put him up when we leave the house. 

Now comes the frustrating part. We could leave Leo for 12+ hours (obvi we wouldn’t do that) and he wouldn’t whimper once. But, the second the door closes to the bathroom he’s screaming his head off. Similarly, we recently moved Leo to the back seat for car rides and needless to say he hates it. Not to mention he’s still very bitty and requires constant attention.

We love him very much and would never get rid of him, but we need some suggestions on how to:
    1. Stop the biting (or will is stop over time) ? 
    2. Allow Leo to understand that it will be ok if we don’t see each other for 5 seconds, or if he’s not in our arms in the front seat. 

I understand we may not have made some of the best decisions in the beginning of training, but we did the best we could. 

Edit: so funny story as to why we got him at 5 weeks. We needed something hypo allergenic and we searched for a rescue for awhile and then came across Leo on Craigslist for a small fee. They told us he was 8-9 weeks old which we fell for and mostly just fell in love. When we took him to the vet the vet immediately knew he wasn’t 8. "

66,[Help] Our 15 year old has giardia,dogs,t3_a9unaz,11,False,False,a9unaz,"Sorry if I’m not doing this properly, I read the rules but I have never posted in this sub before. 

Anyway, our 15 year old mixed breed (Aussie shepherd/cattle dog/lab; usually about 50lbs) started having diarrhea about a week ago. After it didn’t subside for a couple of days, we took her to the vet and they did some tests and she was positive for the giardia parasite. She has been having explosive/watery diarrhea for about a week now. She is otherwise very healthy for a 15 year old. Declining a bit due to hip issues, but healthy for her age.

She’s on metronidazole every 12 hours with a full meal (chicken and rice/bland diet) for 10 days, and liquid panacur once a day for 6 days. She’s been on the metronidazole for 5 days, and the panacur for 3 days. Her diarrhea is definitely still there. She’s having tons of diarrhea accidents at night and it’s starting to get more watery. 

Since she is a senior, this has definitely knocked her down. She’s weaker and usually INSANE about food but isn’t very interested in her chicken and rice. She was the first couple days but now only eats most of the chicken. I tried putting broth in it and it didn’t make a difference. I know side effects of both meds can cause loss of appetite but I’m worried because of her age and her love of food. She is down about 4 lbs from her normal weight. She’s still interested when we eat human food and interested in our other dogs food though. Oh and she’s drinking plenty of water/urinating regularly, which is good to see. 

So basically my questions are- has anyone had a senior dog with this parasite? Most people I have talked to had this in dogs under 1 year old. How long did it take for the diarrhea to go away and did they fully recover?

Also, is there something we can feed her besides rice for a bland diet? She likes chicken but I feel like she isn’t getting enough calories. 

Sorry this was so long! I would love any feedback.

67,[Help] Dog humping all the time,dogs,t3_a9uhde,0,False,False,a9uhde,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have an 8 year old female scottie mix who is spayed.  She is humping ALL THE TIME.  We adopted a new dog several months ago - a male catahoula mix - who she seems to genuinely like.  She will climb into his crate with him and sleep, they each sleep on the same bed most nights, and they spend a lot of time together outside.  She's older and doesn't like to fetch and while he'd love her to play with him more rough, she's older and that's not her style.  So, no signs of aggression, they share bones, no red flags.  


However, the blanket in her crib is CONSTANTLY being humped.  Like nonstop.  She's humping all day and night right now.  She has humped a couple of stuffed animals before but very rarely.  The humping started several weeks ago and seems to have reached a high right when we had holiday guests (that she knows very well and likes).  I don't know what to do but say ""stop"" but she will start up again, inevitably.  The humping doesn't seem to coincide with the other dog ""bothering"" her or invading her personal space and she is clearly the alpha in the house.  If he gets too involved or careless, she tells him to back off and he will roll over into a submissive pose.  He's still very much a puppy, you see, and sometimes gets rambunctious.  Still, that doesn't seem related.  She just had a vet checkup and nothing is amiss.  They say it is likely due to the new dog and it should subside but it only seems to have gotten worse.  


It's a really annoying behavior, TBH.  Is there a way to train her out of it.  I don't believe in punishing either one of them.  And, her being a terrier, she won't do anything she doesn't see in her best interest.  We do occasionally have to medicate her for OCD and anxiety so maybe that would help?  She's a very neurotic dog."
68,"[Help] Going to dog parks/swimming areas, and keeping doggy healthy.",dogs,t3_a9wkaq,5,False,False,a9wkaq,"Hey everyone.

So beyond ""make sure your dog's vaccinations are up to date"" I didn't think I'd have to take precautions regarding doggo's health at dog parks, but after I started taking her she started getting eye infections. Her eyes were red one after the other and weeping TERRIBLY.

So we figured it was the water she was drinking (she loves snorkelling) so I've been taking precautions with that.

But my question's not about the eye infections. That's just an example of how something I didn't see coming impacted our outings.

The question is, **what kind of other health-related precautions do I need to take when I take my dog out to the dog park**?

IE:

* Picking up after your dog to avoid spread of disease (duh)

* Vaccines (also duh)

* I've been taking her own bowl with us so that I know the water she's drinking is clean, since the bowls provided tend to get muddy, and even making sure to empty it out and refilling it wasn't enough.

* I've been flushing her eyes out with saline solution after she's gone swimming, because her favourite thing to do is snorkel. (IE, stick her head under the surface, walk around like that, lift head and shake all over innocent bystanders, rinse and repeat.)

I don't want to be paranoid, but I'm just wondering if there's ""common sense"" issues that I'm completely unaware of that I should take into account.

Our mother's also concerned that our dog will get ""parasites"" from swimming in the lagoon, but I asked her for info and her response was that she was concerned the doggo would get amoeba up her nose or something. I'm... not even sure we can get brain eating amoeba down here in Sydney but maybe there is a problem with waterborne pathogens and I need to take more precautions to keep my dog safe?

**TL;DR -- After taking doggo out to dog parks and swimming and having to flush her eyes/have her only drink from her own bowl to prevent infections, it's left me wondering what other precautions I should be taking that I'm not aware of to keep doggy healthy?**

Also, there's storm water drains nearby -- should I be letting doggo swim near that, or is it fine? It's definitely storm water, not sewage."

How do we introduce him to our Maltese puppy safely?,dogs,t3_a9sazk,3,False,False,a9sazk,"On Saturday we'll take home a 4 year old St. Bernard from my wife's parents. He's spent the vast majority of his life locked up in a cage in their yard. He's been heavily neglected for the past almost 4 years, basically never played with, never groomed. His hair is under the neck and on legs is all tangled up and dirty. All they ever did was feed him. His water gets changed every couple days in the 20 liter bucket. You can imagine what that looks.

He hasn't received any kind of training. He likes us since we're the only ones who let him outside for a walk in the yard and play with him, but he's not very obedient of us, of course. I'd say he weighs around 65 kg (140 lbs). He's not been socialized with other dogs, and just introduced to a couple people.

Now I'm afraid how he'll react to our dog at home. The Maltese is 5 months old now. She's very curious, energetic, and fearless, which I fear could be to her detriment. I'm not sure how to approach introducing him to the puppy safely. He's not an aggressive dog, but I'm afraid he could get annoyed with her and bite her head off or something. So I'd like to avoid this. Them not ever seeing and meeting each other is not an option for me.

I also have some concerns about how he'll adapt to the new environment where he'll be free, and coming to another dog's territory, but that's a whole another issue. We're primarily concerned about the safety of the puppy, as I can see her being excited and jumpy around him. If not angry even. I'm not sure.

We'll also get the vet to come check him up immediately.

I have a 6 month old Siberian Husky, and she's the most energetic, crazy pup ever. She's literally always sprinting around the house and immediately demolishing any food we give her. That is, up until a day or two ago.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, she *always* eats her food. We've been training her to wait until we give her the go ahead so she doesn't just inhale it in two seconds. Either yesterday or the day before, though, she just kind of... stopped eating. She'll take a couple of bites of her breakfast in the morning and then leave it, then take maybe one bite around when she'd eat lunch, and then barely touch it during dinner time. She's still pooping normally which is strange to me because it doesn't seem like there's much going in, for there to be anything coming out.

&amp;#x200B;

She's hanging out at my mom's house tonight while I'm at work and my mom just told me that she ate some of her dinner and then promptly puked it all up and then some. She also didn't eat any of her breakfast this morning again.

81,[Breed] What breed is right for my family?,dogs,t3_a9uhrs,6,False,False,a9uhrs,"COPY/PASTE THE FOLLOWING FOR AUTO-FORMAT WITH BULLETS

Copy/paste the text below into a new text post..

Replace ""ANSWER"" with your response but do not delete the asterisk (*). Leave a space between the asterisk and your response.

Remember to include [Breeds] in the title of your post.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I grew up with dogs. They were all outside dogs and we lived in the country. I am in an urban area and am looking to get an inside dog.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I am wary of rescue's. I have children (3 &amp; 5), and their safety is my #1 priority. I would prefer to have a dog that could grow up with them in the house to avoid safety issues.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I would like to have a dog that isn't large (we own our house, but it isn't a big house). Is cat friendly, is excellent with kids, and is NOT high energy. Medium to small size would be best, with an excellent temperament. Also, I would like to avoid the smell of a hound (the beagle smell).

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Something like a Pug, that isn't all messed up. I really don't know what other medium to small breeds fit the bill of not requiring too much exercise.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands, sit, stay, recall.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work full time, so it will need be crated while I am at work (about 8 hours straight). I could probably make something work out while it was in the puppy stages to cut that timeframe different for awhile until it had a large enough bladder.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30 minutes to an hour. In the summer this number will be much higher since I like to hike (I would avoid hiking with the dog if necessary due to issues with its breed or size). 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Looking for as low maintenance as possible. Not looking to pay a professional. Maybe once a month.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Small to medium.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I would prefer less shedding and slobber. Barking I can handle as long as it can be contained by training.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important. If the dog is outside it will be on a leash or a lead.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I want it to be nice.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I don't have any tolerance for this.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggressiveness is a no go. I'm pretty hardline on this.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 8-9 hours a day while I am at work (at most, it varies with my wife's schedule).

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Their desires are reflected in this. I have two small kids (3 &amp; 6). My primary concern is that the kids are safe.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a house cat.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No. I own my house.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Ohio. I live in an unincorporated township.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers can easily hit in the 90's, winters can get pretty cold as well (30's).

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I am looking for a kid friendly, low maintenance dog that physically fits in our house and doesn't require a lot of exercise, but is able to hike.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

82,[fluff] Our Christmas Eve stray.,dogs,t3_a9p758,31,False,False,a9p758,"I’ve never posted before in this sub but I’ve been following for some time, I thought this made for a pretty good post/holiday. 

My husband works in the oil fields in the Midwest US. Right now our temps are slightly above zero, freezing rain, terrible awful weather. 
He was working on Christmas Eve (having a shitty day, so was I) and when he went to a disposal there was a border collie roaming around. Super friendly, showed up a few days ago but no one at the disposal knew her and no farmers live nearby for miles. 
Meanwhile, her entire butt is severely matted, full of dried dead worms, (who apparently couldn’t make it out of the matting) she’s extremely bloated from the infestation, hungry, cold, and her pads are frostbit. She was wearing what looked like a 20 year old collar with no tags and it’s not uncommon in this state to dump dogs before leaving for home (out of state), or cowboys that don’t give a 💩 about dogs (chained up outside in sub zero temps)

Husband realllllly tried to not add a second dog to our family.
But he brought her home. We had to shave the matting out (she couldn’t actually go to the bathroom because the matting was so thick). We’ve fed her teeny meals throughout the day so it didnt’t shock her system, she actually managed to poop (hurray!) and she’s getting along pretty well with our resident (also adopted) male dog. They’ve had some vocalizations but nothing violent. Thank god. 
She’ll be going to the vet soon (within a week) to get looked at and get her shots.  She’s having a little hard time breathing, and she’s pretty lethargic and tired, but she really wants to be spunky and puppyish. We suspect maybe lungworms or an upper respiratory infection from eating roadkill/weather, so fingers crossed for minor health problems instead of anything severe!
And before anyone says it, yes, all precautions were taken, our dog is up to date on all vaccinations and he’ll be receiving a round of wormer with her, they use separate areas of the yard and have their own space (just to clear that up). My husband has vet experience and grew up in a vet family so, we’re definitely alright. 

It’s funny to say, We were thinking about adding a second dog to our family for a while but decided to keep the space open because we seem to always stumble upon the dogs that really need help. I’m so glad we waited. 

Her name is Eve. 
Yes, I was going to default to Santa’s Little Helper if no one decided a name. 
If anyone has any tips for maintaining a peaceful environment between a resident and new dog, that would be great! Maybe ways to help them bond a little better? Or stories of how your dogs bonded, how long it took, do they just tolerate each other or actually care etc. This will be my first time having two dogs (not my husband’s), so I’d love to hear your experiences. 
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

My physical conditions are tied to severe nerve  pain that's uncontrolled much of the time.

You are all  smarter and more experienced than I am, especially considering I've  never owned a dog before.

This is what  I'm really going to have to consider before I move on with my thoughts.   I need to clear with my housing authority first, but the pet policy is  pretty open.

I will need to be looking at:

A medium (not small, please) sized dog with a low shed potential

A cuddle pup, one that won't mind climbing up with me on the bed and hanging out

Low  activity as far as room to run out high energy.  I am in a quiet,  somewhat rural neighborhood, but I can't have a high energy dog that had  to run, especially because I'm on a hill.  I have a park at the base of  my high energy that will be acceptable for walking.

I  know age is going to be a big thing when it comes to a tempered dog,  like no new pups for example.  I'm thinking 4-5 years, though I'll not  sure if it's a good goal or not.  I just don't want one that will pass  within a couple of years.

What breeds do you suggest?  What I do I need to learn first?  Male or female are both acceptable!

But he still gets very scared so easily that he pees uncontrollably if we bump each other at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we went for a long walk all the way into the woods at the end of my apartment complex. I often have him off leash as he listens to me. Even if he runs off to chase a squirrel, he doesn't go far and comes back. It was different today; he chased something (for some reason, yelping while chasing), and I didn't realize the fence wasn't complete. He ran off and disappeared. I called his name and tried to find him in the woods for a while, to no avail. I realized I wouldn't be able to find him and walked back home. He wasn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought someone eventually would call me since he has a collar with my number, and he's microchipped. About 30 minutes later, I heard a bark (I don't recognize his bark as I only heard him barking a few times for the entire year). I thought it would be another dog somewhere, but opened the front door just in case. There he was sitting in front of the door. What a good boy. I always wondered if he is happy with me as I'm a first time dog owner. I guess he at least thinks this is his home to come back to."

Now I am starting my search for my first ever dog (did not have one growing up) and could not be more excited! If you all could offer any help regarding the breed I should get or general advise, I would greatly appreciate it.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Growing up my family had a farm dog and some farm cats, but that was when I was in elementary school. I have not had any pets since then, though I begged and begged my parents for a dog with no luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

&amp;#x200B;

\* On an average weekday, I would be able to take my dog on an hour long walk/run. I have dog parks in the area and my apartment complex will be finishing their dog park this coming spring, so those are an option as well. On the weekends I could spend  lot more time giving my dog exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am then at home the rest of the night and usually go to sleep at around 11. However, I do travel monday through thursday every once in a while and my family has agreed to watch my dog for those weeks I do travel. Either it be my sister, grandma, or parents.

89,[Breed] What dog breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_a9u23k,4,False,False,a9u23k,"Introduction

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my boyfriend and I's first dog as independent adults. We both grew up with dogs and I have been the primary care-taker/carer of our dogs since I was 12 (this includes an old special needs dog, and then a boxer and husky puppy which I raised, both of which turned out lovely and well behaved). 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I would prefer to rescue a dog, though my boyfriend has never had a puppy and wants to have one at least once so I agreed that if we can't find a puppy that fits our lifestyle in a rescue within ~6 months then we can begin looking for a reputable breeder. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.

While I personally don't mind energetic or vocal dogs (I love my husky more than anything) we will be in a one or two bedroom apartment with overall very limited space. So I would need a dog that is quiet and has at least controlled energy similar to a greyhound. I enjoy outdoor activities so it will be exercised but I don't want it to tear up my apartment if I miss a day. I also prefer dogs that are smart and think for themselves. Ex. In the case of my husky and boxer, the husky is very intelligent and quickly learned many tricks, but only performs them if he recognizes a mutual benefit. Whereas the boxer is very difficult to train but eager to please. She understands all of two commands but performs them with so much enthusiasm lol. I find it more endearing that my husky is so independent and headstrong but actively chooses to obey and be affectionate with me, whereas my boxer is just happy and obedient with everyone and no matter what so it takes away from the depth of the connection for me for some reason.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I prefer mutts, and otherwise the dogs I like are not well suited to apartments so I'm not entirely sure about this one.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I'd like for my dog to know basic commands at the very least, but I find that even the slowest of dogs (my boxer lol) are capable of learning basic commands so I'm not too worried about this. If they can be trained further that would be fun but I know that typically tends to pertain to higher energy breeds.

Care Commitments

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I am stuck at the hip to my dogs, so most of my time at home is spent with them. Focused one on one training I could do at least a couple hours a day until they're older, which would taper off to one hour.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

My boyfriend and I both enjoy going on walks so they'll probably get at least one long walk a day, maybe two. There are no dog parks in his area but local general recreational parks will be visited frequently where there are other people and dogs to interact with. Would occasionally visit trails but they're far off from our city apartment so not a regular thing.

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

More than happy to do any grooming tasks, I work at a vet clinic and am capable of doing most basic things but for any advanced/styled hair cuts (ie. Poodles, etc) I wouldn't mind visiting a professional groomer.

Personal Preferences

9) What size dog are you looking for?

I tend to prefer larger dogs but I'm not picky. I'm inclined to say a medium size breed would be better as I wouldn't want a large dog to be uncomfortable in cramped quarters.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I don't mind shedding at all, the boyfriend isn't a huge fan but it's not a deal breaker for him. Would prefer less slobbering but again not a deal breaker. Cannot be very vocal though unfortunately, I will miss my Husky's singing voice for sure!

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It's not very important to me as there are limited scenarios wherein my dog would be allowed off leash, but if they can be trained to do so it's definitely not a bad thing.

Dog Personality and Behavior

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly to the max lol

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I'd prefer one that does it's own thing but still enjoys my company. 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

An unreactive dog would be better, as it cannot be very loud, and while I am ok with putting in the extra work to socialize particularly anti-social breeds, it would be nice if they were at least indifferent or receptive to meeting strangers and visitors. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Yes

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I would like to avoid loud/vocal breeds.

Lifestyle

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Each week-day they would be left alone for ~6-8 hours depending on my classes and work schedule, but my boyfriend has finished school so he works 6am-4pm so he's consistently home in the evenings regardless. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Boyfriend is on the same page for the most part, no major disputes. He will help in taking care of the dog when I'm not home but I will be the primary care-taker.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We would like to have a cat or two and possibly other various small pets later on.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Boyfriend has a 4 y.o. niece who will visit occasionally.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No known restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Metz, France. In the past pitbull and mastiff type breeds have been banned, and supposedly still are, though they're common in the area so I'm not 100% sure on the situation and there's no info online, but to be safe will avoid these breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Moderately cold winters, 20-30F and little snow. Very warm summers 70-80F.

Additional Information and Questions

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Any mix of breeds is ok as well. I'm not too heart-set on any specific breed as I know each dog is an individual and tends to conform to their home lifestyle when brought home at a young age, but still would like to have a feel/expectation for the breed as a whole.

90,[Help] Does this look like Syringomyelia?,dogs,t3_a9uy1f,2,False,False,a9uy1f,"Just took my dog for a walk and my little guy is doing what appears to be a classic sign of syringomelia. He also definitely shows sensitivity around his neck and head and yelps if someone touches him there sometimes...He is 1.5 years old and I got him from a reputable breeder intentionally to mitigate the risks of him getting this condition (his dad is a champion show dog and comes from a good line of dogs).

91,[Fluff] Some Christmas drama courtesy of our pup,dogs,t3_a9h1yf,75,False,False,a9h1yf,"Our 1.5 year old chocolate lab snuck up to the closet where we were hiding the Christmas gifts last night around 11pm. He found a pound of chocolate-covered raisins and ate them... all of them. We had a holy-shit moment as we collectively realized... Chocolate: bad. Raisins: worse! 

Thankfully, we discovered what he'd done relatively quickly. I called our vet's emergency number and the sweetest woman on planet Earth talked me through getting my dog to ingest some hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting, which worked right away. We've been keeping an eye on him, and it's now more than half a day later with no apparent illness, so I think we dodged a bullet.

This dog, man. He's a handful and a half but I just can't stay mad at him, especially on Christmas."
92,[Help] 10 year old dog - Collapsed trachea &amp; enlarged heart advice,dogs,t3_a9opmr,11,False,False,a9opmr,"I'm looking for any advice for my current situation. Our 10 year old family dog, Ozzy (Cairn Terrier Jack Russell Mix), has been dealing with a collapsed trachea and enlarged heart for a little over a year now. That's roughly when the coughing started.

I've watched it slowly progress into something that truly breaks my heart to see/hear. We've taken him to the vet many times, and have been given codeine + a water pill, since apparently he had excess fluid build up. He has moments where he is quiet, but even then, I notice this constant heavy breathing, almost like he is struggling. When he gets into a coughing fit, it has evolved from the standard ""goose"" sounding honk that comes from the cough, to more a sound that I can only describe as similar to when a human has a really ""airy"" and long laugh that comes more from them exhaling a ton/pushing air out. These can last for 5-10 minutes, and he will either pace around, or lay down with belly facing the ground, front paws out ahead, and resting his chin on them. He's recently got into sneezing fits during these episodes as well. 

The medicine we were given, I imagine, stops these episodes from happening more frequently, but any time he gets excited (which is a lot), they start up. We also have a 3 year old Black Lab/Shepard Mix, who is very gentle with Ozzy, but in recent times hasn't been able to play with him because of these episodes. It's difficult because some nights he'll sleep through the night, and other times he'll have us all up with that cough and breathing issues. The water pill also has him going out more, as expected, but he's recently started to have some accidents on the cough, which I'm presuming happen while he's coughing. 

His appetite is still pretty good during all of this, and you can tell his still has energy when we let him out, because he'll run as fast as he can (even though he'll start coughing during this). I guess I just don't know what to do. It really seems to me as if he is suffering more than he is ""calm"". Surgery for him is out of the question, especially for his age. I don't know whether I need to start thinking about having him put down, or do I try to get a second opinion somewhere else? 

I love this dog so much, but I hate seeing him suffer and just want to make sure I'm making the right decision.

Any advice/suggestions from you guys would mean a lot. Thanks!

We got a puppy pug. He's now 6 months. So often during the day, the older pug will find one of the puppy's toys and pee on it. Which prompts him to think it's time to pee and will pee right next to it.

This will happen even if they've been outside just half an hour before. When they're outside, when one pees, the other will likely pee right on top of that spot. This can go back and forth sometimes up to three times.

But of you cuddle one of them, he “purrs” and it is LOUD. Our other dog does it too but not as often or as loud.

    **Care Commitments**

      6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * As long as I need to for the stuff listed above. I would probably want to devote a lot of free time outside of training to playing and generally being with my dog.

    7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * 2-4 hours. Live outside of a city so main exercise would probably be walks/hikes and throwing a ball for it to retrieve.

    8)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * If possible I'd be willing to groom it myself every day and if not then I'd be willing to pay a professional but would prefer a lower maintenance dog which wouldn't need regular hair trimming.

    **Personal Preferences**

    9)What size dog are you looking for?

    * Medium or large

    10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * Would prefer less slobber and barking but not too bothered about shedding.

    * Both would be fine but snuggly would be better

    13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    * Bit of both
    
    14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * Don't mind barking as a first response but would like a dog which could greet people in a relaxed way and not aggressively.

    15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * I would prefer if it wasn't but would be willing if necessary

    16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    * Resource guarding, aggressiveness and escape attempts

    **Lifestyle**

    17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * Probably 8 hours, 4 or 5 days a week, I'd be willing to hire a walker if necessary.

Will the sex of the dog make a difference to its personality, if so, would you recommend male or female for my preferences?

I also understand that golden retrievers can be prone to some conditions such as skin conditions, is there another breed which is similar in temperament and personality which aren't prone to health issues?

Is there anything else I should know about or consider when it comes to what breed or age of dog?

Thanks!

He's always done it to some degree, but it feels like it's gone up a notch. It is summer here, but even in the colder months he was doing it.

 1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

No.

 1. Describe your ideal dog.

A big affectionate dog that's up for a long hike but able to relax and nap when we're done. My only complain with the current dog (Aussie Shepherd) is he doesn't EVER turn off. I'll run him 6 miles hard and he still wants non stop playtime all day. It can get a little frustrating. 

 1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Wife is interested in Golden and Labs, I like greater Swiss, Bernese mountain dog, saint Bernard, Irish wolfhound. Again, we'd like bigger, a little calmer, and affectionate.

He gave her to his friend's sister. After not seeing her for nearly two years, he got to see her this week and she wouldn't leave his side.

101,[help] any kennel cough home remedies?,dogs,t3_a9vxx3,1,False,False,a9vxx3,"Hello all,

I’m here to talk about my little guy Benny. The fiancé and I adopted him last Sunday. Sunday he was fine, Monday he was fine, Tuesday he was perfect. Before we went to bed Tuesday night, he coughed out a little bit of flem. We made nothing of it, and got some sleep. Wednesday we woke up, and he had been throwing up white foamy “flem” and it persisted all morning, afternoon, and evening. We have an appointment for him tomorrow. The assumption is that he has kennel cough. He was vaccinated for it early December. When we called the adoption center, they called us over to go pick up antibiotics, which he later threw up. Now we have an appointment tomorrow morning, but we are are obviously very concerned. Is there something we can give him just to get us, and most importantly him through these next 10+ hours? 
We are camping out with our little buddy in the living room tonight. Will probably be up most of the night. 

So far the only thing he has been able to hold down is some chicken. He held it for about 45 minutes. Any times he drinks, or eats his kibbles, he throws up. He’s been throwing up randomly. Now he’s just laying in his little bed next to us. 

We were told not to take him to urgent care considering because they didn’t deem it to be serious enough.

102,[help] my old man,dogs,t3_a9vsot,3,False,False,a9vsot,"I've had my old friend for almost 11 years- ever since I adopted him at 8 weeks at an animal shelter I worked at. He's been a great companion for most of my adult life. 

But just within the past couple of years, there's been a decline in his overall health and personality. He stopped eating for awhile and I started using wet dog food to help entice him to eat his dry. (He's now on a grain free dry mix that he eats with interest) 

He started getting a bad rash during the summer so I thought it was seasonal allergies, but it stuck around. I'm giving him weekly baths with 3 different shampoos to help with his itch (which they do greatly!) Where he chewed most of the hair off on his hind end, it is growing back in. 

He started going to the bathroom in my daughter's room and just recently would pee on the Christmas tree, all while we are home and able to let him out. He basically stopped telling us he needs to go outside. So he has to be in an office when we aren't home. And 10/10 he uses the bathroom in the office which has been a big stress at home. The other night, we were home all day and he was let out many times, but he still went in my daughter's room to poop while we were in another room.

He acts like he can't hear us at all. Walking up to him and brushing past him makes him jump. And he basically ignores us or looks at me blankly when I groom him or pet him. He use to show an expression of love or Joy whenever I sit next to him now it's kind of blank or sad.

It has been stressful the past year or so and we are on a tight budget currently so I can't take my 65+lb dog to the vet and afford the check up.

I guess what I am asking for is advice. Someone asked me if it's time to put him down. But I felt like it was only necessary if he was in pain. I'm not sure if he's in pain. He just isn't the same dog anymore and it's sad with him seeming so depressed and disconnected.

105,[HELP] What should I pay attention to when choosing a purebred dog? (Concerning the dog's health!),dogs,t3_a9xzwr,14,False,False,a9xzwr,"Disclaimer: I don't condone inbreeding in ANY kind of dog and I think it's horrible how people will breed a dog so it can't breathe (all kinds of bullies and pugs), walk when it's slightly older (German shepherd), and other cruel issues that will hurt the dog in its life. I am however inexperienced and would like to learn from you guys how to best go about getting a puppy that won't suffer in life because of asshole breeders.

&amp;#x200B;

Facts:

I would like to have a medium sized dog close in appearance/character to a border collie. I just love how they look, how smart they are, and how active they are. I intend to get such a dog mostly because it will be an incentive for me to exercise, and I'd love teaching him or her new tricks and keep him/her busy.

It does not HAVE TO BE a purebred dog and in fact I would PREFER a non pure-breed but with a LOT OF BORDER COLLIE in it so it retains characteristics (size, cuteness level, etc, most of this is personal preference, some of it, such as size, is practicality).

As this point I am NOT really considering adopting a shelter dog as my family has had trouble (real, real trouble) with them in the past, and I simply have (learned) too much respect of dogs' teeth to be comfortable with a dog I haven't raised myself. (Feel free to change my mind.)

&amp;#x200B;

All right. I've long thought about getting a dog and will probably think a while longer until I'm sure I want to be THIS responsible (I have a track record of being irresponsible that I'm trying to change). A discussion with my partner last night made me think and research more closely into health-issues purebred dogs can have.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two questions in particular:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) If we get a purebreed dog, what should we look out for? My partner says it's a matter of looking at a family tree and seeing if at some point in the dog's ancestry (although no further back than say great-grandparents) the dog's line was mixed with some other breed, which would minimize the chance of dog suffering from some sort of inbreeding condition. Is it that simple?

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Is it possible to find a breeder who will deliberately mix in a different breed every once in a while to ensure the dogs are as healthy genetically as they can be?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else we should consider before getting a dog? The actual acquisition of the dog might still be some time off, but I'd like to know as much as possible beforehand to prepare for it."

109,[Help] Is my diffuser making my dog sick?,dogs,t3_a9rf5x,2,False,False,a9rf5x,"Hi all. I'm new to this community and I am on mobile fyi.

I got a nice diffuser for Christmas and I'm in love with it! Problem is that I just read that it may be harmful to dogs, I'm seeing conflicting articles online about it. I don't know if it is just from injestion from the oils or the smells that cause them harm (or none).

Now background: My dog puked three times today and yesterday (total not each day). Once in my basement, once in the car, and once in the kitchen. I assume the car and kitchen one was from the car ride, because she gets carsick.  As for the time in the basement: that is not where I keep the diffuser. She has always been a puker because she eats grass and socks (we are trying to get her not to eat them and take them away when we see her have them).

Anyway, I assume they are unrelated to the diffuser, but I need to know because I am an extrenely paranoid person and obviously don't want to hurt my dog. If it is the diffuser, should get rid of it or at least not keep it on near my dog? Thank you.

110,[Help] 4yo dog tore her ACL,dogs,t3_a9p2ir,13,False,False,a9p2ir," My 4.5-year-old doggo has torn her ACL, and my heart is broken for her. She has had a minor limp for awhile that comes and goes and the vet suspected arthritis. Now a few days ago, the limp suddenly got so bad and she refuses to bear weight on it. I brought her in again and after xrays, the vet suspects a torn ACL, as well as arthritis. 

The vet told me I have two options - $4K surgery or strict rest and anti-inflammatories for life. She and I are both very active, and since she’s so young, I feel like the surgery is non-optional. She’s everything to me and it feels so awful to watch her have to lay around all day with no exercise. However, I’m fresh out of grad school, and $4K is going to be such a tough amount of money to come up with. 

Looking for any advice, similar experiences, words of wisdom, words of encouragement anyone might have.

We live in the Twin Cities in Minnesota. I’m wondering if there are any less expensive options out there - maybe surgery through the University? Is that a thing? We’re also struggling with stairs during this rest time - she’s not supposed to be climbing up stairs or jumping on furniture, but she weighs 50 lbs and it’s tough for me to carry her up 3 flights. Is there a way around having to carry her? 

What have your experiences been like? What will this recovery process look like for us? We’re so anxious to get back on the trails and dog parks. "

113,[Breeds] Is a Silken Windhound or a Windsprite right for me?,dogs,t3_a9plbi,1,False,False,a9plbi,"Formatting is off, sorry!

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first, I have two herding breeds that I got when I was in my mid-20's - I adopted an adult from a show-line breeder and purchased one as a puppy from a working-line breeder.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I'm certain that I'll only be able to get either a Silken Windhound or Windsprite from a breeder, so I'll go that route. I'm okay with either an adult needing to be rehomed or a puppy.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* What I'm looking for in this particular dog is a nice house pet that's ready to play/train/work when asked, but also okay with relaxing when asked. We have a fairly laid-back lifestyle so I'm looking for a dog that will be okay with that. My two current dogs are extremely willing-to-please herders, but that level of biddability is not something I'm necessarily looking for in my next dog. Trainability for basic manners is a must. It would also be really nice to have a dog we can bring to cafes and shops and such.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Silken Windhound or a Windsprite, but I'm not sure about the difference between the breeds. We've been involved with greyhound breed rescue in the past and enjoy sighthounds.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* This dog will primarily be a pet, although it would be nice to dabble in agility or coursing with it. I take agility classes with my current, younger dog, and I'm hoping to compete with her someday. We've actually had quite a few sighthounds in our agility classes, and it'd be nice to try it out with a Windhound or Windsprite, although I'm 100% aware that the training process will be vastly different with a sighthound than with my balls-to-the-wall herder. I take rally classes with my older dog, and we hope to compete someday, as well.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* To be honest, I wouldn't be *that* interested in training with this dog other than basic manners or CGC-type training, and possibly dabbling in agility. This dog would primarily be a companion animal. If it happens to take to agility, I would of course be ecstatic about that and pursue it, but I'm not expecting it to be a fantastic sports dog right out of the gate. 

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* 1 hour of walks or leashed hikes daily. There's a fenced park right next to our house that would be ideal for off-leash running if needed. My current dogs and I hike off-leash almost every day, and we put on a lot of miles during the weekend.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Yes to everything, would be willing to brush briefly daily.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-large. I've fostered greyhounds in the past and found them to be lovely dogs, but too large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle a moderate amount of shedding and barking, but I hate slobber.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* My current dogs are great off-leash, and I walk them off-leash in the woods every day. However, I'm not necessarily looking for that in my next dog and am 100% okay with them being leashed at all times.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine, but snuggly is better. I understand that sighthounds can be a bit aloof, and I'm okay with that.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either is fine.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* My preference is that they'd greet strangers and visitors with friendly curiosity rather than a boisterous, loud greeting. I'm okay with alert barking.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, especially because I have two current, resident dogs. My house is not set up for a crate-and-rotate situation, nor am I willing to manage that behavior.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Human or dog aggression/reactivity, resource guarding, escape artists. Prey drive *may* potentially be an issue (please see below).

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* We have regular, full-time work schedules, so potentially up to 10 hours a day. We already hire a dog walker to come mid-day for our current dogs. We also send our dogs to daycare 2 times a week.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My partner likes dogs and would help with 50% of caring for the dog, except for the sports-related and training activities - I'd be doing all of that.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* So this is the main problem I might be up against. I have two cats, which may pose a problem with prey driven sighthounds, but I'm hoping that raising a puppy or adopting a cat-friendly adult will help with that.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. We have relatives with small children (1-6 years of age). We'd supervise all interactions and would crate/separate when necessary.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope, we own our house.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in the United States. Sighthounds aren't banned here.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* We live in New England; summers here can range from 70-95 F and winters can range from -10-40F with snow and ice. We're willing to invest in clothing to keep a sighthound warm during the cold winter months.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* I'd like to know what the differences are between Silken Windhounds and Windsprites. My understanding is that Windsprites will be extremely close (if not identical) to Whippets in temperament, but my understanding of Windhound temperament is a bit unclear. I've met a couple in the past and they've seemed very typically sighthound in personality. They were a bit aloof, loved to nap, and had gentle, mild temperaments. One of the Silken Windhounds I met was good off-leash, but I understand that this may be the exception rather than the rule."

I’m fostering a 2 year old Boston terrier that hates everyone except for a few people (she is very sweet and loving with me, my boyfriend, and a few other select women) and I’m trying to curb this behavior. It’s not just that she’s scared or dislikes other people- she can be downright aggressive. Lunging, growling, barking. I don’t know if she’d actually bite someone and I obviously haven’t tested it. She does it no matter where we are (though I’ve been trying to not take her in public until I know how to handle this), though she’s specifically much worse with men and she’s MUCH worse at home than anywhere else. 

This is something I knew I would have to deal with (she was like this at the shelter too, I actually was only able to take her on because I work there and she really took to me while I was working with her. They would not adopt her to anyone or allow the general public to foster her), but now that I have her I’m not sure how to handle it because I’m so afraid of her biting someone (shelter policy is that if she bites and it breaks skin/needs any medical attention, she’ll be put down basically. It’s harsh) that I don’t even know how to begin working with this. I have some very understanding friends that are willing to help me, as well as the entire shelter staff, but I’m not sure what the best way to go about this is so that I don’t make the behavior worse. I don’t want to make anything worse by trying to help. It’s worth noting she’s extemely protective over me. She’s aggressive with new people regardless, but she’ll even growl at my boyfriend, whom she loves in general, if we play wrestle or he accidentally hits me or something. 

Thank you guys so much in advance! I really appreciate the help. I’d like to add she came from a pretty shitty home so your probably sad assumptions about why she hates men and acts this way are most likely valid. "

Sarah is mostly my mom’s dog, but my mom is too nice to discipline her very strongly, and my dad doesn’t want to seem like the bad guy. Is it possible to correct this kind of behavior in a 16-year-old dog?"
117,[Help] My dog won’t stop barking when we leave.,dogs,t3_a9tavf,10,False,False,a9tavf,"My dog is perfectly behaved when we’re home, but when we leave she gets whiny and starts barking. We don’t know how long she’s necessarily barking, but we have come home after work to find her barking, and we have also waited outside to find out if she’s going to bark, and she did. 

We have tried Thunder shirts, covering the kennel, feeding her in the kennel, giving her a Kong with frozen peanut butter and food, interval training, leaving the TV on, playing music... I’m probably forgetting a couple. 

I’m convinced we need to try the shock collar. The wife is terrified of them and refuses. But she’s also terrified that we’ll get evicted from our apartment if she keeps this up. 

Should we try the shock collar next, or are there more things to try?"
118,[Help] An Aggressive Golden.,dogs,t3_a9ne6b,29,False,False,a9ne6b,"Sorry on mobile. 

Hello, I’m looking to see if other people have had similar experiences and if there’s any tips or strategies anyone could offer. So my sister has a 1 year old Golden Retriever and he can be quite aggressive. When he was a few months old he started to resource guard, take his toys into his crate and growl if you went near him when eating. He’d also pounce on you if you went into his crate to clean. 

As he’s gotten older he’s started to become aggressive in that you could be petting him and he’s enjoying it then he’d turn so quickly and snap at you. He’s caught my sister a few times and he bit a close family friend who the dog has known since he was a puppy, it was so bad she had to get a tetanus shot. 

He’s snapped at my oldest niece for petting him and my sister doesn’t let her toddler anywhere near him without his muzzle on as she’s scared that he may snap at her. 

The resource guarding has gotten better, as in you can be near him when he eats just no touching. He also does lunge for anything thats not his and does usually give it up with no treat. It’s more the petting issue. He does warn you when he’s had enough as he will lower his head and there’s a twitch in his upper lip that if you don’t stop he’s going to attack. 

It’s certainly not what I would say is normal for the breed and he’s not suffered anything traumatic since my sister bought him from the breeder though I cannot for sure say nothing happened to him when he was with his litter. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this or are there any tips anyone could suggest? 

Edit: Just an edit I’ve mentioned in a reply but I should set the record straight. Regarding the muzzling this was a misunderstanding by myself. He wares a halter to help with lead training which doesn’t cover the full mouth it’s a band over the mouth to help control him when he’s out as he’s quite strong and used to pull when he was younger. He’s actually really good outside and there’s never been a problem with aggression or anything of the sort when he’s out walking. "
119,[HELP] How much do Pomeranians shed around the house?,dogs,t3_a9szel,11,False,False,a9szel,"I finally got permission to get a dog but preferably one that doesn't shed much. From my research I understand this breed sheds a lot, however it can be controlled by brushing, baths, diet, etc. This is a breed I'm very interested in and am really trying to find a way to calm my parent's worry about the shedding.

I plan to buy a Roomba to deal with lose fur on the floor and am willing to brush the dog daily for 15-30 min. Of course I'll also give the pom baths as often as the vet recommends and a diet recommended by a vet as well. Is that enough to deal with the shedding? A little dog hair getting everywhere isn't a huge issue but if it's balls of hair or covering all the furniture then it'll become one. I'm not too keen on brushing the dog AND vacuuming the furniture daily to keep my parents happy so if it comes to that this might not be the breed for me. "

**My dog**:

* I've had my dog Roman since he was 8 months old. He is a rescue, pitbull terrier mix (45 lb) and is 4 years old
* He was abused before and so is scared of a lot of things.
* He has bitten 1 of my brothers friends a couple years ago
* He lunges at other dogs and people he dosent know. Once he knows someone thought he is an awesome dog.
* very attached to me get nervous if I leave the house for 10 minutes but seems fine with my work schedule just not when I come back and try to leave again.

**The situation**

My girlfriend and I, who I lived with broke up and so now its just me and Roman. I moved to a new state because I just changed career paths. I have paid thousands for training and his hip surgery. I also pay a lot to have a dog walker come every day in the middle of the day to take him out and hang out with him for 30 minutes. I also cook his meals cause he loves it.

My family are not dog people so I constantly hear how a young professional shouldn't have a dog and I should give him up and so on. Ive been told to give him up and get a dog who is friendly and trained from a breeder.

**My Question**

What can I do? I cant have people over I cant take him to other people's places, no dog parks. How can I make him this happy dog I can take to a barbecue and let go without worrying? Im in the beginning of my career and I cant spend too much money but I am willing to commit time and effort.

Also any advice on how a single person can manage a social life when they live with a dog (also travel once in a while)? Would getting a second dog give him a buddy to hang out with while I'm at work or the gym?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am getting so frustrated and I just wanna hear from some dog lovers who understand that giving up my dog is not an option."

That wasn't good enough she pestered me for weeks to buy a dog and after weeks of bothering me like an idiot I told her yes.(first of many mistakes) She didn't just go to a shelter and adopt one like a normal person she goes and spends $3000 on a French bulldog(Yes, $3000 for a French bulldog in the middle of planning a wedding) She wanted surgery done so she shelled out another $8000 for her surgery and $2000 for boarding/training for the new puppy.  Yes within a month my wife drops 5 grand on a puppy.  She's excited and I'm annoyed haven't met the dog and already aggravated.  When I visit her in Virginia(I was living in Maryland) I finally saw him and he was a cute little thing but I noticed something(first red flag) she always kept him in the kitchen away from the house.  I'm not a dog person by any means but even I understand that you can't keep them in the crate away from everyone all day that's just cruel.  So I gave her some suggestions about how to be a better pet owner.  Then she asked me could I let him outside?  Nothing crazy about that but she never put him on a leash just allowed him unrestricted access to the yard because it was easier that way.  Then every time I visited her she asked me if I could walk, feed, and give her dog potty breaks and would get upset if I didn't. Quick story I don't dislike dogs but after my baby sister was mauled by a great Dane and needed stiches in her foot I've been cautious of them. It didn't help that I was chased by a stray Rottweiler for 6 blocks when I was younger so don't have warm memories of them. Finally we get married and after months of this I get fed up and confront her about it.  Why do you pawn him off on me when I'm around it seems like you don't want to fully take care of him.  She told me that I'm her husband and it's my job to help her take care of him.  If you don't help me with him this is going to cause issues in our marriage now suck it up and deal with it.  As much as I didn't like that answer like a fool I shut up and dealt with it.  I asked her to potty train and house break him before we move in together.  She tells me she will deal with it when the time comes.  Well fast forward to when we finally move in together and he pees on the floor within 24 hours of moving in.  I look at her and just shake my head and she gives me an uneasy I'm sorry.  Then after living with her for the past few months she's pawned 90% of the responsibilities on me. Now she hardly feed him, take him outside to relieve himself, bathe him, train him etc.  He's still not house broken and pretty much sits in a 8x6 pen all day.  I told my wife that I'm not helping her spend 2000 on training if she's unwilling to follow the instructions given to us by the trainers.  The breaking point for me was she got upset about having to take him outside to use the bathroom.

My wife makes no effort to spend time with him, walk him, etc.  I understand that my daughter is a lot to deal with while I'm at work but my wife got overwhelmed with him as a puppy and needed help taking care of him.

123,[Help]Considering Giving our Shiba away,dogs,t3_a9stdp,3,False,False,a9stdp,
124,[Breeds] Seeking a PTSD service dog,dogs,t3_a9sq1q,7,False,False,a9sq1q," 

I'm seeking a PTSD service dog for my partner, but the dog will be owner-trained (as is the norm in our state) and raised from puppyhood by us instead of being purchased from a service dog organization, so we're kind of ""on our own"" when it comes to figuring out a breed.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, my partner and I have both had many dogs growing up and as adults have successfully raised a Pembroke corgi, who is our pride and joy. We primarily have experience with herding breeds but from what I understand they are not necessarily good PTSD service dogs as they tend to be reactive themselves.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We are definitely going through a reputable breeder so we can properly expose the dog to all situations from a young age. There are no young shelter dogs where we live.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Laid-back, not reactive, not anxious, friendly, easygoing, doesn't require a huge amount of exercise, large to extra large, kind.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* We're thinking a golden retriever is our best bet, but are open to other breeds. My partner has a fondness for GSDs but we feel the exercise requirements are going to be an issue as well as the tendencies toward reactivity.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The dog will be a service dog for my partner with PTSD and will be expected to perform those duties, which will include cueing when my partner is going to have a panic attack, leading him out of the store if he has one, etc.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* We both work from home and already know that our corgi gets many hours of attention each day, so it would be the same with our second dog. He is quite spoiled. :)

1. How  long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of  exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that  include using a dog park?

* We don't want a dog that has high exercise requirements. Our corgi gets a 30 minute walk every day, plus about two hours of more intensive play and training in the backyard (flirt poles, tug of war, fetch, etc.). A dog that needs more exercise than that isn't going to work out for us. Which leads me to greyhounds as a possibility, but we have cats and I'm not sure I'm comfortable having a greyhound around cats (especially cats that are allowed in the backyard, where there's plenty of ""chasing room"").

1. How  much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming  hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you  be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Daily brushing is a norm here. I'm comfortable with grooming at home but don't want a dog that needs frequent professional grooming. Trims at home are one thing.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Large to extra large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Our corgi is very quiet so I'd prefer to not have a barker. Shedding is fine. Slobber is fine within reason.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* The dog should be reliable off-leash in case my partner's hands are shaking and he drops the leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please.

1. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or  entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or  visitors?

* Alerting is good, but not a liability if that makes sense.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, definitely not.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression or prey drive towards humans, dogs or cats. Reactivity.

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Honestly, almost never, because the dog will be with my partner 99% of the time when we go out.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* We are both dog lovers. I will be assisting with caring for the dog and training. We do not have kids, but will be adopting eventually.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, we have a corgi and two cats.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, eventually, once we adopt.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own a house, no restrictions.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* New England, USA. No restrictions.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers are 70-90F degrees, winters are around 20-30F degrees.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* No additional questions."

I'm not the most active person on the planet but I can excercise the dog as much as I need to. Except for breeds like Huskies etc probably.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I can brush the dog every day if that's needed. Cleaning ears and stuff is probably something I'll have to get used to but I'll be fine.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

Preferably a large dog

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding isn't a problem. I'd prefer a dog that doesn't bark too much. It's fine when there's someone at the door or something, but not the whole day. Slobber is also something I'll get used to after a while.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not very important but I do have a big yard which the dog might like. It's unfenced tho and I have cats who are outside sometimes (The cats live in a seperate house on my property with my parents).

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I'm fine with either.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I'm leaning more towards eager-to-please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

The only people that come to my house are friends and family so I'd prefer a friendly greeting.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I live in the middle of nowhere so there's no other dogs here really but if I come across someone with a dog while I'm walking my dog, I'd rather not have a dog that's aggressive.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Nothing I can think of right now.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home so I'm almost always home, except when I go to the store etc. I do like traveling but I'd take my dog with me. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I live alone so no other people involved.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I have 4 cats who live in a seperate house on the property but they do go outside. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No, no children here.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

The Netherlands. I'm not aware of any banned breeds. I'll have to do some research.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: about 26 degrees celcius, with the max around 33 but that's rare. 
Winter: About 0 degrees celsius"

142,[Discussion] Paracord Dog Harnesses: Concerns with using paracord or these designs?,dogs,t3_a9qdwe,3,False,False,a9qdwe,"[](https://imgur.com/a/K4yY1mc)

I'm thinking of making some paracord dog harnesses for my dogs, as I find the harnesses (especially ones with the front loop) make my dogs pull less. We also don't like the idea of choke collars and the leash pulling solely on their neck. The ones pictured above seem like pretty good designs. I understand the first design isn't exactly a harness, but I like the design of pulling the head down, and looping below the legs and behind the shoulders.

However, I have heard some people say paracord can be too rough on a dogs skin/fur, while some say it's fine. Do you guys see any issues with these designs, or using paracord in general? I love saving money and making stuff on my own, but I also want to double check the opinions with fellow dog owners to bring to my attention of any flaws or concerns with making a paracord harness.

Thanks!"
143,[Help] Dog acting off,dogs,t3_a9qdck,7,False,False,a9qdck,"My dog is a 2 year old Great Pyrenees named Daisy. We noticed the change in her behavior last night. She walked into my room last night, but after a couple steps, she backed up really fast into the corner and would not move from a sitting position. Usually, she'll come in and lie down beside me. She wouldn't move for about 20 minutes. She would whine at me (I was laying in bed) and nervously shift. She only whines at the door if she needs to go outside, but she didn't need to.

My sister picked her up to take her down stairs, but she refused to go. Eventually my sister got her to go into her room and she slept there the entire night. My sister said she hardly moved the entire night. Daisy usually moves around a lot, and she doesn't like to stay in one place for long.

This morning she followed my sister downstairs, and I let her outside, but as soon as she stepped out the door she turned around real fast and came back inside. Daisy's breed is a herding dog, and they love being outside. At this point I thought maybe it was her shock collar bothering her, so I took it off and made her go back outside. She stayed out there for about 3 minutes and then whined to come in.

Now she won't move from her spot by the couch. I'm thinking maybe she's sick, but I'm not sure. I could really use some input.

Update: So I've ruled out stomach problems. I brought her some food and she got up to eat it. "

145,[Help] My Portuguese Water Dog...is a horrible swimmer?,dogs,t3_a9qbzr,7,False,False,a9qbzr,"Hi everyone,

I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog. He's a pretty normal dog with the typical PWD quirks. We spend a majority of the time around water (a large lake mostly) on boats, at the beach, etc. Which was a large reason for getting this particular breed. The one problem we have had is that Max can't really swim. He splashes a lot, doesn't move his back legs at all and ends up vertical in the water instead of horizontal. When I have gotten in the water to try to ""show"" him how to move his legs, he just goes limp and I have to carry him back to shallow water where he can stand. We have tried getting him in the water with other dogs, but it hasn't really helped. Has anyone had any success overcoming a problem like this? Or did I just adopt the Water Dog who can't swim? Appreciate the help.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: He doesn't seem to be afraid of water, he actually enjoys being in when he can touch and seems to forget that he is a horrible swimmer. So, it doesn't appear to be a confidence/fear issue."

If my husband and I need to travel for a few days my parents will watch him during that time. That's when he strikes. There is one spot-always the same spot- that he poops in during these overnight visits. We've tried cleaning it, using chemical repellents, taking him on excessively long walks, etc. etc. but he still poops in that same damn spot!

My mom has taken to just putting plastic down there (he still poops on it). He never does this if my husband and I are there, he doesn't have incontinence issues at our home (where he can stay alone for up to 8 hours on weekdays) or even at my parent's house on single day visits.

recently i have been noticing whenever he thinks i’m upset or will be upset he’ll just start pooping while making eye contact! 

sometimes i give him the “the freedom” command, that allows him to explore without having to follow me.  when he goes a bit too far, and i yell at him to come back,  he stops, looks back at me and starts to poop! or if we’re at a dog park, and he gets in a scuffle with another rascal, then i come yell at him, he will put his little ears down, bowing to me, i’ll tell him sit, give him a little time out before i release him again, and as soon as i do, he will go poop while staring into my eyes. 

sometimes we’re walking off leash he’ll recognize someone’s smell and he’ll dart down the sidewalk tail wagging so fast, before he stops realizing the person he smelled isn’t there or is a stranger, then just as i become close enough to see him and am about to yell at him, he will have quickly found a spot and be at the beginning of his poo dance, he does a little 360 spin into a hand stand, balancing all his weight on his front paws, angling his butthole to the highest altitude he can manage before squeezing out little turds.

Since I’ve been considering it for that long, I don’t think it’s just a whim. But I’m still not sure because I’ve always thoroughly consider weed myself a cat person. I grew up with dogs, but all of my adult life I’ve only had cats and I really only know how to take care of cats since my parents took care of the dogs growing up. I know I like being around cats and I’m happy to take care of cats. I like dogs but I’m not sure how much I’ll like taking care of a dog considering they’re more needy than cats in terms of both care and attention.

I’m prepared to put in the time to properly train it when it’s a puppy. I’m usually only away from home for 7-9 hours Monday-Friday for work and I do have a lunch break where I can come home to let it out to go to the bathroom if that’s too long to leave it without a bathroom break. If I travel, I take all my pets with me rather than hire a pet sitter or board them at a kennel. Right now it’s just me and two cats. I own my own house so having to okay having a dog with a landlord is not an issue. I have a fenced in yard. I live outside of town so there’s not a ton of car or people traffic. I’m mainly afraid I won’t be a dog person in the sense that I won’t meet all of its emotional needs (since dogs are more affectionate than cats; like cats are more independent and dogs are more people loving). I’m totally prepared for the walking, playing with, training, bathing/grooming, vet costs aspects. Im excited about the aspect of having an animal I can take outdoors with me (on a proper leash/harness and after it’s trained on the off chance it breaks away from the harness) like on hikes and to the beach. I’m worried I won’t meet the dogs expectations in terms of how much love it wants since I picture myself as a cat person and they’re more independent. 

1. Do I sound like I’m ready for a dog? I don’t want to get the dog and then find out I’m not ready. If I get a dog, I’m planning to keep it for life because I know it causes animals pain and confusion when they have to be re-homed because the owner isn’t ready for it and I don’t want to be one of those people.

3. What would be a good breed for a first time owner as an adult but having had experience with dogs as a child (just not the full responsibility of taking care of them)? I want something small (not more than 20-25 pounds), probably a toy to miniature size dog, preferably fluffy (I don’t mind putting in the extra grooming effort that comes with a fluffy dog or paying a groomer regularly if necessary) that is also sturdy enough to go on hikes or to the beach with me, is adaptable (like if I were to travel with it during  summers or if I were to get involved in a serious relationship after I got the dog [adding a new person into the dogs life possibly]), and is good with cats (I have two currently and they’re both young so hopefully not going anywhere anytime soon)."

168,[Help] dog has vaginal discharge,dogs,t3_a9kv2i,3,False,False,a9kv2i,"Hi. Since yesterday, my dog has had discharge from her vagina. She is an unspayed female rescue,about 11, due to anesthesia sensitivity and a bleeding disorder.

The discharge started as kind of grayish and is now clear and slimy/stretchy. It does not smell.

I originally thought maybe she has pyometra, but her behavior is not at all abnormal. She is eating, playing, and walking...the discharge is the only thing off. I can't see vet until they get back Thursday, but just wondering what this might be? I was thinking vaginitis"

170,[Help] sister's dog is deathly afraid of me,dogs,t3_a9hlr8,3,False,False,a9hlr8,"Apart from maybe the first interaction with me which I don't recall because I wasn't paying attention to the dogs my sister's dog has been super afraid of me. She'll pee and poop if she gets close to me. Which was a lovely incident to have inside a house. 

They believe she's a Whippet. She's a rescue dog. They have had her for a couple years now so she's full grown.  The more interaction she's had with me the more she seems to try and avoid me. It's been a little over a year of this with me trying various things like petting, giving her treats, putting food in her bowl, trying to give her no indication I'm trying to hurt her, etc..

I've never done anything to or in front of this dog to make her afraid of me. Im the 2nd person she's ever treated like this otherwise she's entirely friendly to anyone else. Im just at a loss for what I could possibly do. Any advice would be helpful. 

Im actually going to be living in the same house as this dog in a couple weeks and it'll be easy enough for the dog and I to avoid each other I think but I'd like it so that doesn't have to be a thing.

171,[HELP] Bailey likes to wonder...and pee in the house.,dogs,t3_a9kh81,1,False,False,a9kh81,"I've had my dog for two months. She has some quirks that need ironed out but really, I consider myself very lucky. Considering she's had no formal training (starts in a couple weeks) she's very well mannered. 

The two biggest issues we've noticed is her escaping and her peeing in the house. 

**Issue 1:** Bailey has escaped 3-5 times in the two months we've had her. Once a week after we got her, she pushed passed my wife and out the door. It was a rainy day and I chased her in socks. She found her own way back in the front door after a while. And twice today she escaped from my parents yard (a fenced yard she's been in several times). Today she simply jumped the fence. They have a lower 4' chain link fence. 

At my house we have a privacy, board on board,  6' fence. I'm not too worried about her escaping my yard BUT I'm disappointed she can't use my parents yard to run around in as it's much larger (about an acre). 

For Christmas I got a Whistle GPS device for her collar. I've also ordered a light up collar for her. 

She's microchipped. 

**Issue 2:** She's never been house broken (that we know of). However, she seemed to pick up on house breaking pretty quickly. She goes to the door. But, if you don't make it to the door to let her out in a matter of less than a minute (sometimes less than 10 seconds) she'll pee right at the door. 

She's also more likely to have an accident at my parents/in-laws house, despite having visted both multiple times. I don't expect her to be super great about asking to go out at other people's houses but, I figured it's worth noting. "

We thought nothing of this, but later we found him laying on the couch looking near-dead. I don't really know how to describe this, but his penis was clearly swollen and halfway out of his skin, and his anus was pulsating/flexing nonstop. He clearly could not control this, and was laying down unresponsive with his eyes nearly closed. We kept petting him and saying his name to keep him awake, but we all thought he was going to die right in front of us. After a couple minutes his penis went back to normal and his anus stopped pulsating and he was suddenly back to his old self.

179,[HELP] Convincing someone it's time,dogs,t3_a9jmzw,5,False,False,a9jmzw,"Hello all, 

I'm hoping that some of you can help me figure out how to convince my father to unfortunately, put our dog down.

For some back story, we currently have a German Shepherd, she's 11 and half years old and has had a wonderful life. Unfortunately, over the past several months her physical health has been on a decline and of recent, has gotten to the point where you can't watch her walk. Her back legs have loss muscle, and even with meds, she has been unable to walk very well. My parents have wooden floors which for sure doesn't help. I got a floor rug to cover most of the living room and smaller pieces so she can go to the back door. On carpet, she is able to walk but on wood, it's like ice. In the morning, she is able to walk but throughout the day, it becomes more difficult till the night where she pretty much settles in where ever she lays down since she can't walk, for the night. 

The issue is her quality of life just seems like it isn't what it should be. Occasionally dragging her back legs, sometimes having to stop where she is and lay down till she can gain energy to walk, hardly walk down the two small steps on our porch to go to the bathroom. It all is just so hard to see but my father insists she's doing ok since she hasn't lost an appetite, drinks her water and still very playful. Her mind is there but her physical ability to walk is seriously not ok. I need help trying to sit my father down and telling him it's time, it's very hard to no matter what but I would like any advice any one has that had dealt with the same situation. "
180,[Discussion] Help making a plan for the first few days home with a rescue,dogs,t3_a9jgyq,9,False,False,a9jgyq,"If everything goes well with my in-person meeting next weekend, I'll be bringing home my first dog within the next few weeks! I couldn't be more excited but I'm also very nervous about the first few days at home. I'm a little overwhelmed by the amount of information out there, and I'm trying to get my routine for the first few days down before bringing him home.

Here are the details: he's an almost 2-year-old Great Pyrenees mix who is great with other dogs, (allegedly) housebroken, and has no behavioral issues observed by the rescue other than a higher-than normal prey drive.

I live in an apartment building in a relatively urban area within walking distance of many parks. I've read up on the two-week shutdown and the basic steps for getting a new dog acclimated, but I have a few questions: 

* There are a lot of dogs living in my building so it will be hard to avoid them when going in and out to use the bathroom. I realize this could be stressful during the initial adjustment period but I'm not sure how to avoid it. Any tips from other apartment-dwellers?

* The dog is currently living at a rescue that keeps the dogs in kennels in a barn. They aren't sure how he would do with being crated, but I will need to crate him during the day while I'm working and I'll only have 2-4 days off of work to get him acclimated before I'm gone for the day at work. My tentative plan is to very slowly get him acclimated to the crate the first 1-2 days without actually locking him in, and then trying to put him in there for short stretches and leaving the apartment for he next 1-2 days. Does this sound like a reasonable plan for getting through this process in only a few days?

* Along the lines of the last question, I'd REALLY like to keep him crated at night (at least initially), but I don't want to rush the process if he's not comfortable in there the first day. How should I handle bedtime on day 1 if he's still wary of the crate? Is it confusing for him to let him sleep in the bed and then backtrack later?

* Since there is a fair amount of foot traffic around my building, is it okay to take him for walks during the first two weeks with the understanding that he might encounter other people/dogs, street noises, etc? Or would it be better to drive him to a more remote park to get his exercise? I'm not sure how literally to be taking the advice on the two-week shutdown.

Thanks in advance for any feedback--I am probably overthinking this a bit but I want to make sure he has the best possible experience coming home and I set him up for success in his new home!"
181,[Breeds] Looking for the perfect breed (does it exist?),dogs,t3_a9kz7e,15,False,False,a9kz7e,"My husband and I are hoping to get a dog within the next 3-5 years. We’re both career people and have 9-5 days. While we are totally willing to go on walks and play with our dog, we do want one that can deal with apartment living without being destructive and overly energetic. (That being said, we don’t plan to get a dog until we live in an area with fenced off backyard access where they could freely roam.)

We would prefer there be tendencies toward less barking, being lazy, less clingy, less aggressive. Small-medium is preferable. 

Does any breed fit the bill? If not, any suggestions appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: I’ve owned dogs in past and know that all dogs bark. But I know some dogs howl constantly while playing, when they want attention, etc. while some mostly bark when their guard instinct is triggered. "
182,[Help] Visiting family for Xmas. My large dog pinned sisters small anxious dog,dogs,t3_a9gkuj,11,False,False,a9gkuj,"They met each other yesterday and were doing ok, but my dog (Sadie) apparently went to her dog (cassie) and put her head on top of Cassie’s, which I’ve been told is a sign of dominance?

Cassie didn’t like that and yelped, so Sadie flipped her over with her paws and mouth while Cassie yelped and tried to get away.

We broke it up and Sadie pretty much left her alone after that, but seemed mildly interested in watching her when she would walk by.

We recently adopted Sadie from a shelter where she was a stray so we’re still learning about her, but she has never shown aggressive energy towards us, my kids or my cat, she’s really been a fantastic addition to the family.

She once pinned my moms black lab as well, but that ended quick and now they’re best friends.

My main concern is that my sisters dog is consistently nervous around large dogs, and I’m worried that my dog will continue to pin/ harass Cassie if she keeps projecting nervous energy.

Is there anything I can do to help my dog leave Cassie alone? Should we scold her for it if it happens again? 

Additional info: we are visiting my moms house, she’s never been here and though she knows all the people here we have never taken her on a trip before. 

Thank you for reading this far, I’m new to raising dogs and I want to everything I can to help them get along."

He has never once vomited or anything of the likes but he seems tense. He will not calm down or sleep at all during a 2 hour or 3 hour drive. I went to the vets and told them about my issue, they said try cerenia, so I did, if it did anything it was it made him worse I think! He was drooling and looking in rough shape, better when he wasn't on it. So Im going to say it's not Motion sickness related? I try now to get him in the front seat to look out which helps  a little but then he'll lay down and get back into the panting and all.

I've currently tried cbd oil which I think helps a tad but is not the cure.

He is a super happy dog, no fears, obedient, I've tried giving treats in the. Car and he loves that but there's certainly something there. My next thing I thinj for a road trip will be asking for something to make him sleep for a few hours. We go on our road trip to see family every other month and they are 3 hours away, so it's not a often problem of course but looking to see if anybody has any other ideas? Googling almost certainly comes to motionsickness but after the cerenia, I'd Guess it's not that at all as it's a. Very effective drug for that issue.

For one thing, over the past couple of months, I have noticed that when we go on walks and people approach us after asking to pet her, she is very wary and often tries to stay as far away from them as she can, even after I talk to them and try to show her that there’s nothing to be afraid of. This is not something she did for her first year. She used to absolutely love everyone and want to meet them all. She did have several vet appointments over the summer (spay, eye surgery, hip sprain, small skin rash from swimming) and I’m wondering if that may have had anything to do with her fear of strangers? 

She has also over the past couple weeks been barking nonstop when she goes outside. She never used to do this. She still doesn’t ever bark in the house, but she will bark at anything and everything when she’s outside in the backyard and since it wasn’t something she used to do I’m just not sure what’s going on. 

Another issue that’s been recent is separation anxiety. If I go upstairs or go to the bathroom for even a short period of time I’ll hear her whining for me until I come back, and when I’m not home and don’t bring her with me my family says she just sleeps on my bed until I get back. This is not something that’s been an issue until recently and I’d definitely like some advice to correct this. 

TL;DR My young golden retriever has recently developed fear of strangers, separation anxiety, and will bark constantly when she’s outside in the backyard. What are some steps I can take to correct this new behavior? "

201,[Discussion] Having a large working breed dog living indoors,dogs,t3_a94q7z,134,False,False,a94q7z,"I had an interesting conversation with one of my coworkers today. She has a 4 year old St Bernard that lives outside on a farm property.  

I own a 1 and a half year old Cane Corso mix (110lbs), and I live in the city with a fenced in backyard. 

I don’t believe she was trying to be confrontational, but she made a comment that she didn’t believe it was right to have such a large breed live indoors. She told me “ I wish I could bring my dog indoors, but I can’t. It’s not right. He’s a large dog and he belongs outside.”

I told her I thought my dog was well stimulated, that he goes to daycare 3 times a week, the other days he gets 1-2hr walks at various off leash parks (a lot of them trails, more like hikes). At home he spends most of the day laying around sleeping, or chewing his bone. For 6 months I have had absolutely no problems with him chewing things he’s not suppose to, messing things up, peeing/pooping in the house, anything like that. He has free range of the house while I’m gone. At night he sleeps in his open door crate by choice.

To me, I’ve always learnt that this means you’ve met the needs of your dog. A sleepy dog is a stimulated dog. When I asked her about this she said “he’s a lazy dog, but he’s probably still really bored.”

205,[HELP] My puppy won’t stop aggressively biting me,dogs,t3_a9f7l0,46,False,False,a9f7l0,"My family recently adopted a little puppy, we called her Sheila.

Now, Sheila was wonderful at the beginning, and only bit us sometimes, but now she just goes fucking crazy and bites us aggressively. We have a trainer, we are doing he tells us and it doesn’t fucking help. 
I try constantly pulling the leash, holding her mouth closed, hell even sticking a thumb on her tongue to get her to stop, but as soon as I let go, even if she seems calm she starts again, this time more agitated, biting harder. I try playing with her to try maybe it’s her energy doing it I thought she ignores the toys and goes straight for my hands.

I’m mad, and all my hands are covered with bloody bites.

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore I just don’t want to be with her because of the biting, and it’s very frustrating when you get a trainer and what you get told to do plain doesn’t help.

206,[HELP] my dog has a paw infection that isn’t going away,dogs,t3_a9hafx,2,False,False,a9hafx,Hello all! I’ve been a lurker for years but my dog hasn’t been herself lately so I finally joined to get a second opinion. Her paws are full of what looks like scabs and her whole leg was red.

207,"[Discussion] As Christmas approaches, please be alert to Parvovirus symptoms",dogs,t3_a9bqeg,8,False,False,a9bqeg,"Hi /r/dogs

I adopted the sweetest lab/shepherd mix on Saturday from the Portland shelter. She was spry and playful and amazing, but as the day went on, she was throwing up, had diarrhea, and gradually lost all of her energy.

I was very worried about her not eating and being lethargic, but I convinved myself she was overwhelmed from being adopted.

The next morning (yesterday), she had blood in her diarrhea and continued dry heaving. I immediately called a local emergency vet and took her in right away. I knew something about parvo but as a first time dog owner I've never experienced it. The vet took a stool sample and within 15 minutes diagnosed her with parvo. He was extremely solemn and kept saying that things didn't look good. I was a huge emotional wreck. I've been looking for an emotional support dog for about 5 months and basically loved her within 30 minutes. I felt so bad for her.

We called the Portland humane society and they immediately, and without hesitation, told us to bring her into their hosptial immediately. They took her in at no cost. She's currently being treated with IV fluids and monitored in a quarantined unit with her sister who was adopted the same day and also came down with parvo.

I still don't know what to make of it. They say her tail is wagging and she is ""perky"" but still has bowel issues. The vet seems optimistic but I'm still anxious.

So please, please, read up on parvo. A lot of people are getting puppies tomorrow morning and there is always a risk of these puppies being exposed to parvo. It can kill your puppy within 72 hours if you don't call your vet at the first sign of lethargy, vomitting, and diarrhea.

I'll make sure to update this post as I hear more from them...

208,[Help] Popped on couch + vomited undigested food on another couch,dogs,t3_a9f2bg,4,False,False,a9f2bg,"Dog is 6 months old. 

I went downstairs to find dog poop on the couch, a place she's never pooped before in the almost one month we've had her. The poop didn't look any different from her usual poops.

I also found vomit made up of pretty much undigested dog food on another couch. 

This all happened around 4 hours after she ate.

She's in her crate now as it's her bed time. When I put her in, she was a bit more restless than usual, rolling around and changing positions, but as of right now she seems fine.

It's also worth mentioning that we were at a relative's house today for Christmas, and I took her for a walk around the neighborhood. My worry is that she must have eaten something off the ground, but I had my eyes on her most of the time and didn't see anything."
209,[Help] dog experience hair loss and fur turning white,dogs,t3_a9g3uz,2,False,False,a9g3uz,"Backstory,

In June I took my dog (2 1/2 year old female spayed pitmix) with me to Dallas. During the car ride she sat in the back seat and the a/c was blowing near her face. Arrived in Dallas to the whites of my dogs eyes being pink/red. She began rubbing her eyes and keeping them closed. 

Returned to Austin and took her to the vet. Was given medicine for eye irritation. 

Eyes improved.

A week or so later her fur on the top of her head because to have large dry flakes of skin and she was losing hair. 

Back to the vet, she was diagnosed with having a bacterial skin infection.

Was given medicine over the course of 10 days, she improved. 

Fast forward to October...same thing dry flaking skin on head, muzzle and even her nose peeled and is now discolored.

Was taken back to vet and diagnosed with another bacterial skin infection. 

Same medicine and was also given an allergy shot.

Weeks go by and the skin stopped flaking....her eyes are no longer irritated but physical changes have taken place.

They dark hair around her eyes has not grown back, her nose is still discolored, her muzzle is now white and the once flaky spots on her back are now filled with white hair.

She is now losing hair starting on her hind legs. It’s moving towards her tail area. 

I’m at a loss. I plan on taking her back to the vet Friday. I do not feel as though the vet looked into the root cause deep enough at the beginning. 

Any suggestions? Do I try my same vet again or go to a new vet? Her physical appearance is night and day different. No dog that is two years old should have fur that turns white and be losing this much hair. "

221,[Help] I’m at my in-laws’ house for Christmas and my FIL just slapped my dog in the face. I’m upset and I don’t know what to do.,dogs,t3_a9boq0,13,False,False,a9boq0,"I have two dogs. The little one has this quirk where when you lead the older one by the collar, she starts barking at him. I don’t know why, but she does. So we just don’t do that around her. I’ve always hated the way my FIL treats my dogs (yelling at them in German when they know zero German commands, we’re all Americans, and things like that). But today the older one was outside and I guess FIL didn’t want him outside anymore because he went out and dragged him in by the collar. To be fair, he didn’t know this would set the little one off. But I saw it coming so I grabbed her collar to keep her away from the older dog as he was being dragged in. 

Anyways, she starts barking and the older one starts barking back. Then FIL reaches down and slaps him in the face. I said “don’t hit him please” And FIL said “oh sorry.” I told him I could take both dogs. When they get into a bark-off we put them in their kennels for cooldown time. But he wouldn’t let the older dog go. He kept holding his collar as I said “I’ve got this.” Eventually he slipped his collar because he was trying to get to me and so I led him gently by the scruff to his kennel. 

Both dogs were very very wound up for a while. Right now I’m sitting with them in the den, they’re asleep in their separate kennels, and I’m crying and I don’t know what to do.

228,[HELP] severe seperation anxiety with aggression,dogs,t3_a99irr,10,False,False,a99irr,"I’ve posted about my dog Dixon before about this issue. He’s a 3 year old catahoula with seperation anxiety issues. He’s on Prozac currently. He has had instances of getting aggressive (growling, snarling, barking, biting, scratching,etc) when I leave my apartment. I moved recently but made sure to make it a slow move and I took a week off to get him acclimated. Everything was fine. He let me leave for work and most evenings without any issue.

Then last Wednesday my boyfriend slept over. Thursday morning my boyfriend left when I took Dixon out for his walk. Before work I usually try to go for 20-30 minutes. Then we got back inside and I got all of his toys and food ready and he did his desperate “don’t leave me” aggressive thing. 

I know I’m gonna get heat for this but I had to tie him up to my bed so I could get out of my apartment without being bit. I don’t feel good about doing it but I also can’t miss work. I’ve had to tie him up every time I left since that day. I absolutely hate it but it’s the only thing I can do right now that will keep me safe. I understand it is not safe for him but unfortunately my safety is more important. 

I’m exploring seperation anxiety training but it requires that he cannot be left alone during the duration of the training. I’m not sure I can afford five days a week of daycare/dog sitting for a month (or more). I’m also not sure there’s a daycare out there that would take him considering he’s iffy with other dogs. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on what to do until he can start this anxiety training. And maybe some words of encouragement because I’m starting to consider rehoming/surrendering because I’m at my wits end and I’m hating the fear I feel every time I try to leave my apartment. "

238,[HELP] I thought I wasn't a dog person... Turns out I just hate my boyfriend's dog,dogs,t3_a8whm2,288,False,False,a8whm2,"***update***

So I've started letting Louis out more frequently and I don't actively encourage him to drink water at night as I used to do.

He's more manageable now at the very least. Here still complains if left in the cage with no one else in the room but I consider that to be semi reasonable and I work at home so it's inconvenient but not a crippling issue.

He can't be trusted to walk around the house unsupervised because he will still Mark and hide the larger puddles of pee in hard to get to areas. The local humane society was closed for the holidays but once they get back open I'll set a date for his fixing.

One of his major bad behaviors is humping aggressively and uncontrollably for the first few days we were here Dixie barked at him and visibly restrained herself from killing him because all he wanted to do was barrel across the house with his snout stuffed in her crotch. He still does a certain amount of this and I have to imagine this will stop altogether one he's snipped.

We lost his leash in the move so I'll have to get a new one, those of you with specialized knowledge and/or experience I'd appreciate if you have a recommended leash for a 3lb dog.

BTW a lot of you have developed some misunderstandings here. I mostly haven't corrected people because I didn't think it was terribly germane to the subject of dogs or having a dog but I'll at least offer some peace to those of you who appear to have gotten the most excited about the situation.

1. My boyfriend insists that Louis' behavior was better before we moved in together. He feels guilt over the fact that in a four-year period Louis has had to change homes 5 times with Louis not even being 6 years old. His defensiveness is centered around that guilt and the conjecture that that stress of constant moving has caused Louie so much stress that he's regressed and acts now like he did as a new puppy. (I know that can happen to humans but I'm not super sure that's a thing that can happen to dogs).

My boyfriend even goes so far as to suggest that Louis is acting out in retaliation to bad treatment. I may not know dogs very well but I was a behavioral Neuroscience major so I know for a fact that only the most intellectually advanced social animals are capable of calculated indirect aggression of this sort. I no longer argue with him on that point I just roll my eyes and try to change the subject to doing something more productive than hand-wringing.

 
2. We only have Louis because my boyfriend's previous partner neglected them both, to go out and cheat with other men. So he got stuck with Louis in part because he bonded while trying to keep the dog cared for as his real owner ignored him and part because Louis was a companion during bad times. 

3. My boyfriend has trained dogs up to a decent level of behavior before. He owned pitbulls as a child and successfully trained a St Bernard named Bruno up from puppyhood to be very well behaved (or so his relations tell me). Bruno got hit by a car when he was 4 years old, two years before my bf and I met.

4. We both have ample experience with children. He raised his niece as a single father from 15 to 23. I'm satisfied with his ability to impart good values to a human. I co parented my nephew with my sister from the time I was 11. So I'm not particularly concerned

5. This isn't super relevant but a lot of you seem to think I'm a woman. As a 6'2, 270 pound man this is a rare and amusing experience for me.


***Update***

I always wanted a dog growing up, I come from a Caribbean family and we were not particularly close to other animals. what's more, my mother always feared dogs and not without good reason; my older brother got mauled on the legs pretty badly when I was about four or five.

so I went into adulthood knowing that there's a lot I would have to discover if I ever became a dog owner.

As of about 3 years ago I moved in with my boyfriend who already owned a black chihuahua named louie. And I f****** hate this dog. He pees in the house constantly no matter how many times you take him outside, he steals food, is incredibly disobedient, sometimes it will randomly take a s*** in the house. We tried crate training and all he does is whine and bark constantly until you let him out at which point he will choose one or two spots around the yard to pee in and then expect to come back in the house to relieve himself the rest of the way. Worse than that he will start baking in the middle of the night to be let out, sometimes its 3, 4 or 5 a.m. at which point I wake up make sure he gest something to eat &amp; drink, then let him out to do his business.
that wouldn't be so bad except when I bring him back inside our room and put him back in his cage to sleep next to us he just starts whining again, there are times when he'll do this five times a night.
 Worse yet, my boyfriend is a heavy sleeper who never hears him so it's always my job.


from this experience I just assumed that maybe I'm not a dog person.

But we recently started renting a room from my boyfriend's mom and she has a deaf Pitbull-mix, named Dixie. Dixie is objectively, the goodest girl, despite being deaf she always listens to commands, never steals food, always wants to cuddle, holds her bowels or bladder for half a day if she needs to, she's gentle with children, loves to play but isn't rambunctious and is generally a respectful lovable dog on all levels, I give her a kiss on the forehead Everytime I see her. She is a joy to have around and I feel bad whenever people don't make time for her.

So now I've discovered that I don't hate dogs, I just hate this particular chihuahua Louis. The hatred is deep enough that I have actually thought to myself that if Louie dies or gets lost I need to remember not to seem happy because I'm sure my boyfriend will be devastated. The other day I was preparing some candy to take to the old folks home where my boyfriend works.  I stepped away for a second and Louie jumped up onto the furniture and ripped into one of the bags.

The candy is not that expensive so I was only moderately angry about the fact that he made a mess but I actually thought to myself that I wished I had bought dark chocolate instead of cheap milk chocolate for the residents so that maybe he would've just died from eating it without anyone blaming me specifically.

my boyfriend insists that he doesn't need any training and that we just need to get him fixed which for the record we've only had the money to do in the last week or two(we used to have roommates that never paid their rent so money was always tight up until now and we didn't want to ruin our credit by breaking a lease).

I'll happily get him fixed but I doubt that these crappy behaviors are purely the result of having testicles. I'm just barely tolerating this dog as it is and I'd really like some guidance 

I know Chihuahuas live a long time so I'm hoping I can find a better solution than praying for the death of this creature.

239,[help] when to know to say goodbye? :'(,dogs,t3_a9943y,6,False,False,a9943y,"I have a 13 year old pitbull. She has really bad osteoarthritis in her hips and back legs. This has created severe mobility issues. She can only take a few steps at a time. rarely stands up on own. She has been in this condition for 2 years. My husband and i carry her outside, bring her water and food, etc. She still eats normally, has normal regular bowel movements and has control of her bowels and lets us know when she needs to go outside. She takes joint supplements, a NSAID, and CBD oil. Lately she seems to be in more pain. Panting more, whining more, where we can not figure out what she needs. In past it was typically communication for a need like water, food, outside, repositioned etc. Now she will continue whining after trying to give her all her basic needs. So im assuming its pain. Last few moths she seems more depressed and uninterested in anything that used to give her joy. She was a licker and anytime we were near her she would strain to give us kisses. Those have stopped. We have a wagon and wheel her around the neighborhood to sniff things, she no longer has an interest or gets excited on those trips. How do I know when it is time to say goodbye. Im struggling because her internal organs are functioning fine at the moment. I have tremendous guilt for thinking about this just due to pain and mobility. Is it her time? and I being selfish for holding onto her? What if she's not in as much pain as i think? I always thought I would know for sure when it was time but I have so many doubts right now that I don't know what to do. She will be the first dog I will have to make this decision. lost a dog to cancer in June and he died peacefully at home so mother nature helped me out on that one.

I need to drive with her for 500 miles after the holidays (it was either that or leave her at a boarding facility but her high anxiety makes that close to impossible). Normally in a regular vehicle she likes to ball herself up behind the drivers seat (on the floor behind between the rear seat and the back of the front seat). She feels most comfortable there in a very tight space (secure) while being close to us. 

Our upcoming trip will be in a different vehicle (Eurovan) that doesn’t have rear seats or any tight spaces so I’m looking for ideas on how to make her more comfortable. Ideally she would be between the seats in a very tight, secure spot. I’m considering making a small wooden box with three sides she can jam herself into if she wants. A crate is too flimsy — it scares her if there’s any movement or rattling. 

On her own she will try to jam herself under the drivers legs in this vehicle which isn’t safe (brake/gas pedals!) so I’m really hoping to find an alternative. To those of you thinking leave her at home, it’s not possible in this instance (we normally do). "

Our current dog is a golden retriever. He is almost 2 years old. And while he was a tough puppy when we first got him he has turned into an incredible dog. He knows over 30 commands, walks well on a leash, and absolutely loves other dogs! His favorite place is the dog park and he tends to be the most popular dog there. 

We have a pretty established routine down. We take him on an outing every day. Whether it be a long walk, a trip to the dog park, or up to the mountains for a hike. 

We are looking for a slightly smaller breed than a golden retriever, probably around 2 years old, and are hoping to adopt from a shelter.

248,[Help] Training advice for new puppy,dogs,t3_a97tfn,4,False,False,a97tfn,"Hi all,

My gf and I adopted a Siberian husky puppy two weeks ago and we’ve been having a blast with her. She’s incredibly smart and doing really great with the introductory training things. She’s actually the most chill puppy we’ve ever seen and we are frequently told that.

The only issue we’ve repeatedly had since getting her is when we have to leave and cannot take her with us. 

For example, every time we leave to get food or go to church things which take less than an hour and a half to two hours, she soils her crate and we always come back with her whining. 

On the other hand, she sleeps through most of the night. We started taking her out every 2 hours when we got her but now she can sleep for 4-5 hours without needing to potty during the night. Granted she knows someone is in the same room as her at these times. But she’s never had an accident during the night or whined except for the first night we had her. 

I don’t think this is a separation anxiety, as I’m sure she’s still adjusting to everything and wants to be with her “pack.”  Thoughts? 

She gets plenty of attention and exercise during the day. 

What are your guys’ recommendations on how to improve this? I’m wondering if it’s a simple as leaving progressively longer starting with just a few minutes then coming back. For kennel/crate training we did the suggested letting her get into it on her own time. She will get in on her own it when prompted with a treat. She’s on a consistent feeding and potty schedule outside these random times when we need to leave the house for a short time. 

I’ve also wondered if that above solution is the case, if we leave the room for, say 5 minutes, and she whines so we need to wait until she quiets or has an accident or return and just reduce the attempted time we try to leave until she’s never whining? Most would say not to budge until the whining stops, but I’ve also seen some say having an accident voids that and you should attend to the dog and the accident. 

Thanks for the help! Open to any suggestions and methods. "

While looking for the owner, a family told us the puppy was abandoned by someone who drove away.  We went to 4 different shelters, but no shelter was able to help.  We were told abandoned dogs are common in our area and shelters are overwhelmed.  They did check for a chip, but there wasn't one or a collar.

We ended up taking the puppy home and got the puppy checked out by a vet.  The vet estimated the puppy is around 10-13 weeks old with relatively good health besides being underfed.  We think the puppy is a boxer terrier mix.  We've seen no behavior issues so far.

We're trying to find the owner, but we don't like our chances.  Original owner finding dependent, we'll likely end up keeping our new furry friend.

261,[Help] My 8 month old puppy is choosing to not be potty trained.,dogs,t3_a96ket,13,False,False,a96ket,"Ok little bit of context: about 7 months ago I adopted a puppy from someone’s back yard. She was in bad shape but we got her fixed up and she’s been a great addition to our family. We already had an older dog who is perfect, never barks, perfectly house trained, and just a lovely dog. When we brought the puppy home we started crate training her; she was in the crate during the day while we were at work (we would come home and take her out on lunch) and then she was in the crate at night while we slept. She only ever had two accidents in the crate right at the beginning, but then never again. So clearly she knows how to hold it.

When we first got her we were living in a small studio apartment, and it was making potty training very hard. She would get out of her crate and pee on the floor right away, before we even had a chance to take her out. So we got the idea to use a pierce of turf outside on the porch. And it worked perfectly. She stopped having accidents inside and would go out to use the turf. We still took her outside regularly but the pad was there if she ever needed it in the middle of her outside trips. 

So about a month ago we moved into a new house with a huge yard, we haven’t got it fenced in yet, but it’s made walking both the dogs much easier. However this is the issues: since moving the puppy has almost chosen to not be potty trained. She just pees now whenever she wants and it’s driving us crazy! We’ll be in the kitchen and she’ll just walk in and pee right there next to us, after having just been on a walk 10 minutes before! She’s also started pooping on the new back porch and peeing out there too! I’m worried she now is confused about where to pee and when. But she knows how to hold it so I dont understand why she just pees whenever she feels like it?! She’s a very smart Aussie mix and I’m worried she’s choosing to disobey. Please help! "

It's a great feeling when I see pets return after staying with us for their first time, and even better when they're actually excited!! 

I was looking through our business page at all of the clients being excited to see their animals having a good time, and was just really happy to know that the pictures that were posted weren't staged or fake - the animals were truly having a good time.

263,[RIP]GoodBye Malka,dogs,t3_a8yf1u,5,False,False,a8yf1u,"A furry friend came into my life, many years ago, who changed my life forever. She taught me invaluable lessons and accepted me no matter what. I knew she was genuinely happy to see me every time I came home and I am a better man because of my time with her. She died in my arms last night after a full life and on her own terms, comforted by the ones she trusted, her family.

A little back story. Malka was a lab-mix born a little shy of ten years ago, we think. As she was rescued from an abusive home, we never knew her exact birthday. She was beaten and abandoned when she was only a pup, left without food and water for over a week. She was on death's door when they found her, besides being emaciated, she was ravished by parasites and most of her hair was falling out. We met her 8 weeks later, her health revived, her hair grown in but she was scarred. It was evident. she was the most skittish dog I'd ever seen, scared of everything and everybody. There were 5 other dogs at the foster she was with, and she was always the last one to eat, last one to come in and obviously anti-social. But when I saw her nine years ago I knew. As she peeked her head out of the house, all I could see were her ears, and they were magnificent! They were tall, and she  maneuvered them masterfully, so much that we would learn to gauge her mood from them. When they were fully extended, at full alert, she had the passing resemblance to a bat. I knew this ridiculous creature needed my love. What I didn't know was it was I that needed her love far more.

A couple days later, paperwork completed and adoption approved, she finally came home and what a handful. The representative from the rescue told us she was unadoptable and said ""when"" you bring her back instead of ""if"". Looking back, I think his words gave us an extra resolve to show him wrong, to show him that she was not damaged beyond repair. He was dropping her off at our house with the foster and as Malka saw the only human she'd learned to trust walk out of her life she let out the most heartbreaking howl I had ever heard. It was long and loud, filled with the pain only she knew. We had to keep her leash on constantly for an entire week, even in the house, to keep her calmed. She needed to be in the same room as we were, but didn't want to be too close. I had to carry her down 4 flights of stairs to do her business because she was petrified of the elevator and had no idea how to navigate the steps. She slept at the foot of our bed, but wouldn't get in, she followed us everywhere around the house but always at a safe distance. She was a mess, but she was our mess.

Besides the howl, Malka was uncommonly quiet, no barking or growling or even crying. She didn't vocalize at all for almost a year, until a day I will never forget. She was sitting on a day bed she had commandeered overlooking the parking lot of the apartment complex and we heard something. We didn't know what it was, it was totally unfamiliar and it was coming from the dog. It wasn't quite a bark, but it was something. We hadn't known if she would ever have a voice and here we heard her learning to speak again. We now believe she was beaten for barking and it was at this point that she trusted us enough to know we would never hurt her. Over time her bark became commonplace as she warded off the delivery drivers, let us know when she had to go or sassily talked back. It was about this time that she began sleeping in bed with us, whether we invited her or not. She started out staying down by our feet, but it didn't take long before she started to sneak in between us as we slept. Some of my fondest memories involve her rolling around on her back, squirming and knocking the pillows off with her nose.

After much time, work and love she finally felt safe and her role as protector really started to come out. When we took her to dog parks she always stayed close to us, and would aggressively bar her teeth at any dog she thought got too close to her Mom and Dad. She wouldn't eat until we both got home from work and was always at the door to greet us. If we were sick or upset she was always right there to comfort us and she showed her gratitude every single day. As the days went by the haunted look in her eyes started to subside, but would sometimes come out when she felt threatened. Thunder and vacuums, fishing poles and broom handles along with a myriad of other things were terrifying to her. Taking her out of her comfort zone could be challenging and getting her nails clipped at the groomer could be a herculean feat. She loved vacations but hated getting there and would cry and whine the whole way in transit, but when we arrived she would be so happy to be with us no matter our destination.

Malka, I hope your new destination is filled with open fields to run and squeaky toys to play with. You will never be forgotten.

264,How did you find your dog sitter? [Help],dogs,t3_a961oq,4,False,False,a961oq,"I've been going nuts trying to find just an average dog sitter with common sense, but I can't seem to find one in my area! Granted, all of the ones I've found have been through Rover, but that's only because I have no idea where else to look. Did you go through nextdoor? Or just have friends/neighbors/family who would help? All I want is someone I can trust to take my dog out to do her business, feed and water her the appropriate amount, and not leave a house full of loose dogs for hours without someone else watching them. My dog is pretty easy going and has no real medical issues so I feel like it shouldn't be this hard but so far every sitter has been lacking in at least one of those areas."
265,[HELP] I just adopted a pyrenees/golden retriever today and have questions and concerns.,dogs,t3_a92c8y,19,False,False,a92c8y,"Hey all. His name is Ghost and hes 1 year and 6 months. at the shelter he was the only dog who wasn't barking, and he seemed very timid. But when we got him out in the training room by himself he opened up a bit and was a pretty sweet dog. His papers say he likes women, but men need to approach cautiously because he spooks. I'm a 6""4 male and he initially cowered away but after kneeling down and letting him approach hes perfectly fine with me. But it makes me think maybe he came from an abusive home before. Here are my concerns I have now:

He knows his name, he perks up when you say it, but he just does not come. Hes house broken, but doesn't appear to know commands. When i try to get him to go outside or get off the bed so we can try and feed him, he just sits there. Gently pulling on his collar or coaxing him doesnt work. Being more firm and pushing him, he hunkers down and resists hard. We practically have to lift him off the bed to get him to come.

He doesnt eat. It's only the first night having him, but I made a bowl of his food that he ate at the shelter and he ignores it. Doesnt respond to treats either. Lady at the groomer tried to give him 3 types of treats and he just sat there looking happy.  I'm chalking this up to stress and nervousness, but am concerned all the same. 

He pants. A LOT. And drools. A LOT. In our cozy front room (he loves our couch) its about 72 degrees. He pants. In our room, we have the fan going and it's closer to about 50-55 degrees. He pants. All the while, slowly dripping drool. 

He strikes me as an old soul. He seems very content and calm. His tail wags when you pet him and he has no problem with you sitting next to him. But he gets timid when hes not laying on the couch or the bed. Hell wander around sometimes and if I pop into the room, he b-lines back to the couch or bed. We try to encourage him and pet him and baby talk him so he knows hes loved but he doesnt seem to respond well. Frankly, I'm worried he might be a little bit slow just because of how calm and retreated he is. Not that that would change how we love him at all. 


We have a German shepherd beagle mix and a German shepherd doberman mix and he acclimated very well to them. No problem sharing the bed with them and no aggression. But he doesnt attempt to play with them, or interact with them at all really. 


So that's the list of concerns I have. This is my first adoption that has been like this. What do I chalk up to ""new environment nervousness"" and what do i need to look deeper into? Also an advice about this breed would be awesome. Hes the biggest, and longest haired dog I've had so it's a bit new "

268,[Help] Should I keep my Beagle in this situation or not?,dogs,t3_a95pm5,5,False,False,a95pm5,"Hello.

Our last dog died 4 days ago(17 years old). She was mixed breed, a small, but very hardy dog. As long as she had food, a bit of affection and a short walk, she was happy. We used to keep her outside, free to roam the yard. Lived most of her life together with her mom, which passed away in 2009. 

The vet which took care of her said that he's got a dog for adoption which might suit us, after the old one died. I expected something like a mixed breed, or a puppy stray dog, but it was an 11 month male Beagle, quite a nice one actually.

So, I've adopted him and having him for 3 days. I took him for walks, played with him, bought him some toys, all the good stuff. 

However, big problem. I'm still living with my parents for a while, and they will not, accept having him indoors. So, whenever I'm not walking him, or playing, he is mostly alone in the backyard, and I can tell he's not really enjoying it, as he is always ''asking'' for attention, or scratching the doors and stuff. I have tried to make them understand that this is not a dog that can be left outside, but they cannot comprehend, for the sake of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:

&amp;#x200B;

Will he get used to this lifestyle? Is this unhealthy for him?  (especially during winter) 

By this I mean being solitary a significant amount of time of the day. He's got a nice cozy shelter, but I feel that is not enough, during winter.

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I just give him away to somebody whom I can trust, and which will accept keeping him indoors, and be most of the time in his company?

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, I'd keep him, because I like him. But in the end, if that's not healthy for him, I will not, and I will give it to somebody I can trust. 

Keep it, or give it away?"

I can’t tell if he’s playing me for a fool so he can get tastier food, or if he’s in legitimate pain. 

I’ve wondered for awhile if he’s having an issue with his teeth. His breath is atrocious, and there was a strange crunching noise in his mouth about a year ago. I took him in then, and numerous vets told me that it’s too dangerous to put him under anesthesia to check his teeth, he probably just has dirt in his mouth, and any issues would likely resolve on their own. He does like to chew on sticks and dirt when I’m not looking, so I went with it. He was eating with no issues.

He’s had TPLO surgery on his knee and no one mentioned the risks then (2016), so I’m confused why it’s an issue now. The earliest I could get another appointment is Jan. 2, but I want to be prepared when I go in. Anyone have any advice?

It constantly is jumping on furniture, getting it's paws on counters and tables, chewing up things and even tore into my couch.

292,[HELP] Dog has bitten me 3 times,dogs,t3_a8vqaf,17,False,False,a8vqaf,"About a year ago we adopted a retired hunting hound from our local shelter. We quickly discovered that if anything woke her up, she would attack it. She bit me in the face about a month after we got her. We didn't want to get rid of her, as its obviously just because she was never a pet before. We also think she may have been abused by her last owner. 

We've hired 2 trainers, the first one thought we needed to earn her trust, and gave us some exercises to do with her. Hand feeding her, talking to her in certain ways, etc.  She got better for a while, until one day I was vaccuming the house and she jumped off the couch barking and snarling and chased me into the sunroom. She jumped against the doors a few times and snapped her teeth at me a bit before walking away. (The doors are glass so i could see her)  I was so scared that I just stayed in there till my husband got home. 

So we talked to our vet, she put her on Prozac and had us start doing desensitization exercises. Giving her people food when scary things are happening (like the vacuum or thunderstorms), waking her up gently from far away by talking to her, taking her for more walks in more varied locations, etc.  This Also worked for a while but she started slipping back into the aggression slowly just growling and barking but not attacking. 

We hired a 2nd trainer, who everyone said was great. That trainer insisted the dog saw us as other dogs, not as her people parents, and tried to get us to be more dominant with her. Correcting her when she did wrong, not allowing her on furniture, us controling inside/outside/play/nap/kennel time, no more people food. This broke the dog. The dog started snapping and growling again, but not biting so we stopped doing what this trainer said. 

It's been maybe 2 months since we stopped that and the dog seemed pretty much back to normal until last night. We were all sitting on the couch, me, my husband, and the dog watching a movie. I'm not sure what triggered it, maybe a loud noise in the video, or maybe I moved slightly, and the dog bit me twice on the arm. No warning growl or anything. 

I've called every other trainer in a 2 hour radius and with the exception of one lady who uses shock collars, which we are unwilling to do, everyone says they can't help. I really want to help this dog, but I'm at my wits end. I don't know where else to turn, I'm scared to be alone in the house with her, I know it isnt her fault, but after being attacked 3 times I just can't trust her. 

I made a new account for this because I know I sound like a horrible person, but I had no where else to turn about this. Does anyone have any advice on what to do?!  How can we help her?  Can she be helped?  Should we just rehome her?  I love her, but I'm scared to death of her. "

My boyfriend and I rescued a dog 4 days ago. Luna is one and a half, so smart and incredibly sweet; kisses and cuddles right off the bat!

She’ll be doing fine on the leash, like she knows what’s expected of her, and then she will *very suddenly* act frantic and run as far and fast as she can against the leash, over and over and over. Jumping at its end. Even if we stand still and wait for her to come to us, she won’t come she’ll just keep jumping against it, over and over again. Then (like she’s done it before) slips out of her collar OR harness and runs right to the elevator. (Our apartment has a rooftop area with a dog park, thankfully her slipping out hasn’t happened on the road yet). We don’t know what do to.. Obviously we’re afraid to walk her out on the street because she slips out of her stuff so easy, no matter how tight we set it. We don’t know her breed (their guess was border collie but honestly she could be anything..), we will take her to a training course but it doesn’t start until January 8th. What do we do in the meantime? Suddenly freaking out on her leash is really her only major issue."
298,[HELP] Is there anything else I could have done?,dogs,t3_a8vfuc,14,False,False,a8vfuc,"So I'll start by saying I am absolutely obsessed with my puppy and I only want what is best for him. He is close to 7 months now, he's a cocker spaniel mix and he is about 20 lbs. He will likely be a little over 25 lbs fully grown. I have put an immense amount of time, effort and resources into training and socializing him.  


Part of the effort I put into socializing him is walking him and taking him to the dog park. For the most part, this has been an incredibly positive experience. The park is just one big fenced in area - it is not separated into bigger and smaller dog areas. They only dedicate a single hour on one day of the week for 'small dogs,' though in my experience no one is ever there. So for the most part, we will take him and he plays with all of the dogs.  


This has never been a problem in the past. He LOVES other dogs and from what I have noticed actually prefers playing with bigger dogs. I find he can be a bit too rough with smaller dogs and his energy scares them away. So this morning my puppy and I came there bright and early. We were the only ones there, so I started working on his recall, which went really well. A while later another medium to larger sized dog came in and my puppy and it started playing. Another couple of dogs came in (all medium-large in size) and my puppy loved it. He was having fun chasing and being chased by the other dogs, sniffing lots of bums, you know regular dog things.  


At this point, there was probably about 5 dogs in total including my puppy. That's when another medium sized dog came in and immediately started being kind of pushy with my puppy. He would growl and chase him around and then bat him and roll him over and then trample him a bit. This made me so sad to watch and eventually two other dogs started joining in and my dog was being chased/batted/rolled over and trampled by 3 dogs.   


At this point I'm trying to grab my dog and take him out because I can see the dog that's just come in has actually started biting my puppy a bit. I'm calling my puppy and his recall has improved, so he's trying to run over but then the other dogs keep chasing/trying to bite him. The dog's owners aren't doing anything, just standing there watching/talking. Finally my puppy runs to me with his tail between his legs. He is obviously terrified and I feel like such an asshole.... I take him out of there and check it for any sore spots and he's okay.   


We walked home no problem, but I felt so guilty the entire time. I feel so stupid for going into the dog park when it wasn't the small dog hour. I should have just waited... It just usually isn't a problem. I take him to the park multiple times a week and that has never happened.   


Is there anything I could have done differently? I have thought of a potential solutions in the future:

1) I only go during the small dog hour, even if there aren't any other dogs there we can work on his recall. Will also call the city and request to have more small dog hours implemented, or even suggest having the park split into two sections for small and big dogs.  


Or should I just continue going to the park as usual? I feel so bad I do not want my puppy to have a negative experience/association with other dogs. He is such a sweetheart and literally loves every other dog. "
299,[Breeds] Looking for medium energy dog for family with children ages 5 and 7 - Help Please!,dogs,t3_a8vdoj,20,False,False,a8vdoj," 

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes, this will be our first dog.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We would prefer a rescue.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

We are a family with young children - ages 5 and 7 - so a child-friendly dog is a must. We would like a medium energy dog who enjoys playtime but is also able to calm down and enjoy hanging around the house with the family. We would also prefer a dog that doesn't shed or slobber a lot, however this is negotiable.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We were originally interested in golden retrievers and labs because of their reputation for being family-friendly dogs, however we are open to any breed/type.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

We would like a dog that can easily be walked on a leash and can follow basic commands.

**Care Commitments**

1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

My husband works from home, so although he will need to be working he is okay with having the dog around throughout the day. In the evening, I am fine with taking time to walk the dog and play with it.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

We have a medium sized fenced-in backyard that the dog will have access to, as well as 1-2 walks per day. We are okay with occasionally taking visits to a dog park as well.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We don't have much experience with dog grooming, but are willing to try to learn to do it at home.

**Personal Preferences**

1. What size dog are you looking for?

We are unsure on what the perfect size dog would be for our family. It's not a huge factor for us.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I do not want a dog that is constantly barking. I would prefer to not have to deal with a large amount of shedding and slobber, but that is less important to me than the barking.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

This is not something that we consider largely important. It would be nice, however our yard is fenced so the times when this would be necessary are minimal.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

We would like a dog that enjoys snuggling but is also fine with doing its own thing.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

An eager to please dog would be good for the children, however we are also fine if the dog is slightly independent.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

We do not want a dog that is going to bark at or be aggressive toward house guests.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, we do not want a dog that is aggressive in any way.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

The biggest factor is finding a dog that will not be aggressive towards the children.

**Lifestyle**

1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

My husband works from home, so the dog will not be left alone for long hours. However, he will be working and won't be able to be playing with the dog during that time, so the dog will have to be able to be independent enough to tolerate that. On the weekends, the dog may be left alone for a few hours (3-4) occasionally.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

No one in the family has owned a dog before. Both adults are willing to be equally involved in caring for the dog, but we are looking for a dog that is good for a first-time owner.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No, we do not plan on having other pets.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, we have two boys ages 5 and 7.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No, we are homeowners. There are no dog restrictions in our HOA.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in a town just south of Nashville, Tennessee. There are no laws that we are aware of that ban certain breeds.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

A typical summer day is usually around 90 degrees and a typical winter day is usually around 45.

**Additional Comments**

We have been looking into golden retrievers and came across this dog in particular. Any comments specifically regarding him would be especially appreciated.

300,[Help] Allergic to new puppy?,dogs,t3_a8y73r,1,False,False,a8y73r,"I recently posted about getting a new puppy and feeling overwhelmed but after a few days I got used to the new routine and now I feel far less stressed and absolutely love him. However, now I have a new problem... I might be allergic. I have had minor allergies to trees and grass but these are the most severe allergies I have ever had. They started about a week after I got him and it feels like the worst cold ever along with super itchy red eyes. I went to the doctor for an allergy test to be sure and haven't gotten the results yet but I don't know what else it could be. I grew up with dogs and I am around friends and family dogs all the time and have never had any issue.  Could I suddenly become allergic to dogs? 

I am currently taking Allegra and Sudafed but its doing very little to help. My doctor suggested giving him up if I am allergic, but I cant even imagine doing that. Is there anything better I can take or other things I can do to prevent my allergies from being so severe? I gave him a bath the day I got him and just gave him a second one.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was at work when we got a call and I answered, it was my mom screaming and freaking out, going on about how my dog was dying and his flesh was falling off, my boss immediately recognized my panic, I must've paled. I couldn't think, she just said, ""Go"" and I booked it. I rushed to my house, picked him up, and sped to an emergency hospital. According to my mom, he was crying in pain and suffering. I didn't even have a chance to look at him as they just did a tape wrap around him with a towel.

I hate my mom.

The whole car ride there he was perfectly fine. In fact, I realized he was a little too fine and started to calm down, once I reached the emergency hospital. I brought him down from the car, brought him inside and no one was panicking. I didn't' understand anything. The vet removed the towel and.... There was some pieces of skin missing, nothing to go call me to work about screaming, yes it looked mildly displeasing, but the horror, the panic, the disgust, the unnecessary drama, my mom is a fucking idiot. The money that I had saved up, now half of it is gone, because of her stupidity. Because she's an idiot. I hate her. I hate her so much right now.

The vet told me **not to give him surgery and to let the flesh rot off. He kept insisting it was a burn.** I have an appointment for Wednesday for a surgery and now I'm being encouraged not to let him get the surgery. I'm going **insane**. It's been three months of this nonstop, I haven't been sleeping right, I've skimmed on eating just to save up for his vet visits, I haven't even been able to finish applying for the colleges (I need to do portfolios), I haven't been able to do anything but work and take care for my sick dog.

When will it end? When will he be okay? When will my dog just be healthy again? I don't think I can keep doing this for another two months, I'm so tired, it hurts to think about euthanizing him but if the vets aren't going to help him, what difference will it make? My mom kept going on about how he was suffering and crying, and the only reason why he was crying is because people came over and he didn't want to be in quarantine, he wanted to go say hi and play outside. That's why he was crying. I just don't know what to do anymore, I honestly don't. No one is helping and the vets still haven't given him a proper diagnosis this is beyond frustrating...

304,"[Help] My dog never takes medicine, she smells/tastes it despite her NEEDING it tremendously",dogs,t3_a8vfmh,24,False,False,a8vfmh,"Hi all,

My dog has been having severe arthritis issues this winter to the point where she is having a very hard time walking. We've been to a couple of vets and I have a friend who is a veterinarian and knows what she is doing, so she's been helping me out a lot. Long story short, we've been giving her meds in the past for her seizures which so far, knock on fake wood, she hasn't had any more.

But now that her arthritis is acting up, we've been giving her CBD Oil and Gabapentin mixed in with human food (because she will NEVER eat it with her food, for some reason). She's the type of dog that doesn't eat that much food, always been that way. But she needs to take this Gabapentin and CBD Oil (both liquid) in order for her to start walking better again. We even try just inserting the meds straight into her mouth but she will get extremely anxious and either shake her head to get it out or maybe even nip at us, in an extreme case. 

What the hell do I do... I need Lucy to take her meds. Do you guys have any tips/tricks for stubborn dogs when giving meds?"

It's not like this is the first time I've tried to do this - it happens very often, where she will stop doing the trick once I give her a treat.

It seems like pretty basic dog functioning that upon a reward for a behavior, the dog will continue to do that behavior for the reward. It doesn't seem like my dog picks up on that idea, though. Any help?

313,[help] my dog went balistic when she saw another dog,dogs,t3_a8yq6k,1,False,False,a8yq6k,"Story:

So I've had my dog for several years now and I feel she's very well trained if not a bit stubborn at times (which personally I like, she knows when I'm serious about a command and knows when she can pout) and is very kind and gentle to everyone she's met- however recently she's been basically throwing a fit when she sees another dog outside the window which results in her ""weeping"" (whining + small barks resulting in a weep weep sound) and running around the house. I believed this was just excitement cause there was another dog outside the house and maybe it's territorial maybe she wants to meet the other dog outside but yesterday I took her on a walk at a park where you're SUPPOSED to have a leash on your dog but of course someone didn't and so this little jack russel looking dog runs over and starts jumping around before being called back. My dog has encountered this before and usually just tries to play and jump too but this time she absolutely freaking lost it, whipping around in the leash pulling harder than she's ever pulled, and basically screaming (that bark+whine thing)

Problem:

Now obviously she was extremely excited and wanted to play however I have a intense fear of letting my dog play with other dogs just randomly because she's not a small dog and could do some damage but at the same time she's not a big dog and could be dealt some damage- I want to take her to a doggy daycare center to socialize her more with other dogs but I'm terrified that she's either going to hurt or be hurt since previous attempts to have her play with a dog have resulted in her acting very afraid regardless of the size of the dog and even one time snapping at the other dog in a warning type of way.

Tl;dr

Dog is socially inept when it comes to other dogs and had begun freaking out big time when she sees another dog. I want to socialize her with other dogs but I'm scared (due to helicopter parent and previous experiences) that she will get hurt or hurt some other dog. What's the best way to help her learn 1) not to freak out when seeing another dog 2) relax more around/be not socially inept with other dogs"
314,"[Help] well, the behavior came to a head yesterday, in probably the worst way possible.",dogs,t3_a8yjkw,7,False,False,a8yjkw,"As I’ve posted about recently my dogs behavior has drastically changed over the course of the last month.. this is due to me moving a lot, and a schedule change, so I’m sure she is a bit confused and just wants to be comfortable. Well yesterday she had the worst day she’s ever had. I hope it was just one bad day, but her recent behavior makes it seem like she’s constantly in defense mode. 

Basically what happened; my roomate and I, and his niece were outside playing with my dog, off leash, as we were playing fetch. She was being her normal self, just playing fetch, exerting a ton of what I’m sure is pent up energy, when his other niece lets her dog out of the house, it’s a little spaniel looking dog, even though we told her specifically not to. at first my dog completely ignored him or maybe just didn’t even notice him. Well, as soon as she noticed him, she darts straight at him, he immediately gets scared (of course, my dog is 100 + pounds, I’d be scared too) and snaps at her as she goes to sniff his butt. She snapped, grabbed this poor dogs mouth and that was that. He didn’t die, thank god, thank god she didn’t grab his neck or throat, I ran over and wrapped around my dogs neck, she immediately let go, though I did have to hold her down. He just got stitched up and seemed okay even after the incident. 

As for my dog, I took her to the vet right after because she has never showed that display of “aggression”. I’m just kind of at a loss because I don’t know if it was true aggression or if because she’s been defensive if it was reactive. She was sort of in this mode when I took her to the vet, but obviously completely fine when being handled by the vet. 

After the vet I took her to where she grew up and where my friends still had their dogs, she was completely fine with them just like always, they literally gang up on her, bite her and hump her, literally doesn’t care at all, doesn’t do anything but play with them. Then took her to my dads where there’s another dog that’s kinda like her mom. She was a little stand offish with my dads dog, but to be fair his dogs kind of a bully. 
 
After talking to my vet and explaining how she was vs how she’s been lately, I think it came down to this; as a puppy and even up till like 3/4 months ago, she was very submissive, I’m talking she’s the dog that lays down if another dog is any sort of vocal or tries to be dominate. Almost like a person fed up with being bullied my vets guess was she realized that standing her ground is better than letting other dogs be the boss. This is magnified by the fact I just moved, she’s not comfortable there yet and she has anxiety. I think this comes down to anxiety, and lack of exercise( I work a lot more than I used too ) = her lashing out. 

My thing is, I don’t trust her now. I don’t trust her to go to a dog park and enjoy herself anymore, because she seems like she’ll react to anything badly. This is a dog I’ve taken to off leash parks since she was 10 weeks old, and now I can’t. I’m not putting her or any other dog in that situation. I guess my question is does anyone have any advice on how to get back to the point of letting her run with other dogs  without worrying? Do I just go for it and show confidence when I go there that I believe in her, and that this just happened by circumstance? Do I take her but muzzle her? Again this is a dog that was sooo submissive to other dogs not even 2 months ago. And if you’ve been in this situation please let me know. I love her, I know going to the park and running makes her sooo happy and I don’t want to take that from her. "

It probably is painful. I know all of that. But other than this issue, he is pretty ok and that is what makes it so hard. I thought the decision, when the time came, would be more clear. I didn't think I would feel like I was doing it for selfish reasons (not wanting my home filled with diarrhea and not wanting to spend thousands more). I'm so torn. I know he's not as happy as he used to be... but it's not like he's unable to move or go for walks etc. I also know the decision is mine and no one can make it for me. But... some advice and shared experience would be appreciated. Sorry for the long message and any typos... writing this with tears streaming down my face. My boy... my good, good boy. "

320,[HELP] My Lab is Terrified of Bug Spray,dogs,t3_a8vs4y,7,False,False,a8vs4y,"My 4 year-old black lab is friendly, almost overly so sometimes. She’s a genuine sweetheart to people and neighborhood dogs,. Basically, she’s a great pup, but we have an issue.  She looses her mind when we spray fly repellent. 

The specific repellent is ‘Hot Shot Flying Insect Killer’. 

Our Great Dane doesn’t react at ALL when it’s used, but she (the Lab) becomes a quivering, scared, shaking mess. 

Does anyone know why this?"
321,[help] very odd looking growth/wart on my Basset’s mouth...,dogs,t3_a8xpy7,3,False,False,a8xpy7,"Hi everyone! I have a 1.5 year old basset hound named Willie and I just noticed this today thing on his mouth today — not sure how I can share a picture here, but I’ve attached a tinypic link here [Willie’s wart (?) ](http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2e19a4j&amp;s=9#.XB_lHhaIbDs)   (^sorry in advance! it’s kinda gross looking in my opinion, haha)

Whatever it is, it looks very strange. It has a very weird texture, as if it has hair follicles in it or something? I tried gently squeezing it to see if anything would come out, but nothing and he didn’t seem bothered by it until I started it examining it. He seems fine otherwise — eating, drinking, and playing normally. He has had a small blemish on his mouth before from rubbing it raw against the plastic part of a toy, which I ended up getting rid of and the blemish healed on its own, but this one is different looking.

Any ideas on what it may be or how I can treat it? Hoping to make a trip to the vet after the holidays, but thought it would be good to get some info if any one had experience something like this before with their pup.

Thank you!"
322,[help] isolation distress - undoing my behaviour,dogs,t3_a8u7zd,3,False,False,a8u7zd,"Hi. I have a 3yr old staffy that is very friendly and loving. I've had her 2 weeks and in that time it's been a bit of a ride.

1st week I increasingly left her alone because I had work. She seemed ok although peed and pooped 2 times during the night. After the 2nd time I made her sleep in a crate, which she seemed happy with (lots of snoring).

2nd week is the start of time off work, and this is where I think I've messed up. Initially just gradually increased time together. Got her groomed, going to the vets, walks, training (got her to understand a clicker, whistle, and get to stay, kinda). However, I started noticing she would sit at the door and stay there when I left the house (my heart sunk when I saw this). I put a camera in the house and I noticed she'd pace around the house looking for me, staring out the window, sitting at doors, some whining, rarely settling down and now peeing on the carpet. I thought wildlife videos on the tv would help, not really.

I've started to desensitize her by opening the door whilst she's there and not. The door handle seems to kick off her whole panic. I thought it was my keys. She's gone from running to the door (on door noise) to sitting up in the sofa. I'm doing this a lot listening for her reaction and then making myself present (by sounds). I've also stopped getting her out of the crate when I get out of bed, I do something else, ignore her, then come back a few minutes later once she's settled down. I'm also reigning in my affection and acknowledging her i.e trying to get me to give her belly rubs .

Thankfully, she is mostly calm by herself when I'm in the house, even if I'm silent. It's the act of leaving the house (by the rear door, not front I've noticed). She's almost an angel when on walks.

This is mostly just a dump of thoughts as I'm stressed out tbh. Hoping for a bit of support or tips. I've also just noticed I can hear her snoring whilst I've been upstairs in my room with her on the couch.

323,[Help] Large dogs as emotional support animals (flying),dogs,t3_a90ere,5,False,False,a90ere,"Does anyone have any experience with large dogs (90+ lbs) as emotional support animals, specifically flying with them?

I've been barked at by many dogs, whatever. So later in the night I walk upstairs to grab some stuff, and I open a door coming up from the basement. Immediately this dog jumps up from its bed and starts barking and running at me. I jumped back a little and kind of got in a defensive position as I had never met this dog and didn't know anything about it. The dog bites into my leg, and I start bleeding pretty good with a nice puncture wound. Luckily his mom got the dog away from me and put it in another room. I later learned I'm the third person bit by this dog, including someone who had come to paint the house. This post is mostly just me being curious, as I don't intend to sue them or anything,  but what should they be doing/what are they doing wrong? It seems to me like they shouldn't just let a dog walk around that has already bit 3 people, and taken a pretty good chunk out of me for seemingly no good reason. Thanks in advance"

The last three weeks he has been slowly declining, cancer was spread throughout his body and his kidneys were failing. The last few days he has refused all food and was getting so weak, so he was sent to Heaven this morning...

Throughout this all, I’m so thankful of the memories that I have with him. I’ve never seen a dog with a personality like him, and there’s a giant hole on my life now. My best friend is gone, and I feel angry with myself. Being at college, I can’t see him as much as I used to be able to. I wish I could’ve been there more for him, taking him on walks and giving him good boy belly rubs. It’s never easy. I wish I could give him one last hug and kiss, and it kills me knowing that I can’t do that. I just pray and hope he knows that I love him so much and that he loves me too. 😭"

He doesn’t whine or anything, but I can’t imagine it 1. Feels very good or 2. Is good for him long term. But he has **always** loved being in the kitchen with us and seems truly happy, I honestly feel it would affect his happiness if I, say, gated him off to only carpet.  Has anyone ever had “shoes” for a little guy like him?

If those are the only option, I’ll try them, but wondered if anyone who has had experience with senior dogs with similar leg problems might have a recommendation. The only obstacle other than finding them is actually getting him to *wear* them. He can be fussy, but I wonder if he’ll realize they help him? Any help/suggestions greatly appreciated!"

334,"[Help] advice for ""rescuing"" neighbor's neglected German Shepherd",dogs,t3_a8pfxl,9,False,False,a8pfxl,"I've been renting at this house for a year and half, and there have been dogs next door.  No one has lived there, and someone is squatting now (possibly a relative, but there's no power).  Recently the city cleared (scraped) out trash from the backyard, including cars and boats, a full meat freezer, tires, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I've started feeding the one German Shepherd that is left.  I saw him digging through trash one day and couldn't take it.  The way he looks and how he has been eating the past few days i'm sure they're not feeding him.  I did see someone drop a styrofoam takeout box in the paint shed where he stays occasionally.  He doesn't see very well, he's very skittish with sounds, and wary of people.

&amp;#x200B;

The family i live with has had some stand-offish conversations with the owner of the house, in the past.  We are a white family in a mostly black neighborhood, and they've been resentful when we suggest they change things.  For example, in response to complaints about smells, rats, and mosquitoes, they said ""no one uses their backyard around here"".  Not to mention concerns about the dog getting out, which it does all the time.

335,[Vent] My neighbor sucks.,dogs,t3_a8cn91,1,False,False,a8cn91,"My neighbor has a pitbull.  She's a very very sweet girl and very loving.  She's horribly neglected though.  I offered to purchase her for 250 dollars, planning on rehoming her, but he refused.  She's on a 10 ft length of chain and no one ever plays with her, or pets her aside from me.  Our yards are not fenced and we're very close together.  My dog Lulu and Skye (the Pit) play all day if I leave Lu out.

Often, they forget to feed Skye.  I know, because -I- feed her and put her bowl in a specific place, upside down so I know if it's been moved at all.  They always feed her in the same place so if the bowl's moved, I know they've fed her.   They often don't fill her water bowl.  I do.

She had no shelter, no house.  I got a dog house and helped her learn to use it by giving her treats in the dog house.  I make sure she gets a little love, but it's hard because she's so desperate for attention and love that when I get close, she jumps all over me and scratches the fuck out of me, even in long sleeves and pants.  Her nails need to be cut, badly.I'm trying to save to buy a house with a  yard, and if I do, I'm going to simply take her and leave.  People say to call animal control, but they won't do anything because she has shelter now, and food, even though it's cause of me.  If they did take her, she'd be labeled aggressive because she's a pit and all of them in the parish are.  I've called pit rescues, and none will take her because the owner will refuse to surrender her, and because if I steal her and they take her, they can lose their non profit status.   I've been searching for a home for her, but no one wants pits and the one shelter who would take her, even if I took her, said they won't take her in because 'pits don't move'.

&amp;#x200B;

I also am afraid to start crap between the neighbor and me, which could result in him moving Skye to a place I can't get to her to help her, or worse.  I'm afraid my own dog would get hurt. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I woke up at three and heard a dog crying, and assumed it was Skye who has a very baby sounding bark.  It was about 3 am.  She was okay, so I went back to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got up at 7, I realized they had a tiny pit puppy in a carrier outside in the 45 degree weather and she was covered in shit and dog food and pee.  I brought her inside and bathed her, then let her play on my floor for about an hour. I fed her and gave her water and then wrapped her in an old towel and put her back.  They finally came out to get her at about 11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

If she's there in the morning, I'm taking her and bringing her to the shelter.  She's a tiny, beautiful puppy and someone will take her home.

I can't do another Skye.  It hurts my heart too much."

340,[Breeds] For funsies with potential to be an actual thing,dogs,t3_a8l4lt,36,False,False,a8l4lt,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first. I've trained Cairns, a terrier mix, a dachshund, and two Standard Poodles. Quantity-wise I have a dog prepared to take his TKA test. Quality-wise all of my dogs have had great manners and enough basics to make them wonderful companions. 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Breeder, but am keeping an eye on some rescues. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Smaller than what I currently have. Trainable, but doesn't necessarily have to be the most trainable or biddable. Either less active and cuddly or more independent if more active. Good around children. Playful. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My random list of possibilities somewhat in an order: Cairn, Boston, Bichon, Miniature Poodle, Papillon, Miniature Schnauzer, Maltese, Yorkie, French Bulldog. But I'm definitely open to other options. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* CGC, Trick Dog, and then I'd try whatever else seems to fit the dog. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 10-20 minutes of training daily with 30-60 minute sessions once or twice a week. Interactions and play would be on and off while I'm home. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30-45 minute walks daily alternating between training walks (usually on the shorter end), sniffy walks (usually on the longer, and long line walks (a mix of sniffy and distance training). Playground workouts are also a big hit with my current dogs and would be something I continue. A lot of big moment tricks if possible (Louis loves his daily push ups). No dog park, but we'd occasional visits to my parents' house to play in their yard with their dog(s). 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm fine with whatever - especially with a smaller dog. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* &lt; 25lbs, but there's some wiggle room.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Preference is very little shedding. But could handle a smaller shedder. Barking is fine. Not a fan of slobber. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I'm fine with either. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A little bit of both would be great, but would lean towards eager-to-please. However, I'd also be fine with ""able to be motivated with food/toys/games/etc"" 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Bark with a knock. Indifferent to happy when they enter/meet.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Leash reactive? Yes. General DA? No.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* n/a

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 3-4 hours at first and then eventually 8-9 hours

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Louis and Owen would love a short sibling. [They have many short friends](https://i.imgur.com/oqYCtsg.jpg) 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Louis and Owen, 2 and 1 year old Standard Poodles. Other than tank pets, that's about it. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes 

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Own my home

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* No bans

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Hot, humid summers and mild-cold winters with some bitter days interspersed. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Once I went to a dog show to inquire about dachshunds and ended up with information for a Cairn breeder. My mind is easily changed. But I also know my limits; Dachshund to Cairn is one thing, smaller dog with me on the fence about shedding to Golden Retriever isn't going to happen.

342,[Discussion] Dog looks uncomfortable during group play at kennel.,dogs,t3_a8seu6,4,False,False,a8seu6,"Dropped my 9 mo. pup at the kennel yesterday as I will be away for the holidays. She's only ever socialized with other dogs while on a leash, and she has always been jumpy and over-excited when she sees them. The boarding service offered to help socialize her a little more with group play sessions with other dogs. I said yes because they're a really great place and I trust their staff.

I'm watching her group sessions through the webcam and she seems so uncomfortable. The rooms starts with a few dogs and builds up to about 30 dogs. The whole time she's kind of off by herself, walking around alone, or standing by the door. Yesterday she seemed okay with other dogs coming near her, didn't really engage much though. Sniffed a few butts but otherwise kept to herself. Today she seemed to walk around a bit more but when I checked in again near the end she was very obviously dodging dogs that came close to her. 

I know that the staff wont let anything dangerous happen, but from a personality perspective what does this mean? I really thought she'd enjoy these sessions because she seems to want to play with dogs when we're out for a walk, and usually she's the one that ends up getting too up in their faces with her puppy excitement. She seems like a brand new dog here.

Her tail isn't tucked but you can tell that she gets (happier?) when she's near the trainer and by the door because her tail will pop up and start wagging. Why is she more comfortable seeing dogs on leash but scared off leash? Isn't it usually the other way around? "
343,[Help] Four year old dog still acts like a puppy,dogs,t3_a8pvds,15,False,False,a8pvds,"I've had my dog for three years now and I've kept hoping and kept hoping that she would calm down with age, but she hasn't. I walk her for an hour every other day and thirty minutes the in between days. She plays with toys, eats a lot of food. Has my girlfriend's dog to play with on the weekends. All of this but she is so stinking hyper. Whenever we go on walks she will want to just take off sprinting every ten seconds, so she won't stop tugging on the leash. She chews up anything she can find if I try to leave her out of her cage while I leave. This has led to me having to crate her one hundred percent of the time I'm not with her. When I bring her over my girlfriend's house with hardwood, I cannot leave her out to walk around because she just runs and slides everywhere so she is either outside or in a crate.

344,"[HELP] brought senior dog home today, immediately had to return him. feeling so shattered and guilty.",dogs,t3_a8qv8v,15,False,False,a8qv8v,"So, we've been waiting a month to bring this 11 year old male puggle in to our home. We were so excited. His owners assured us he loved dogs, has never had any bad history with dogs, and was just a generally well behaved and great dog. We did have a meet a greet where him and my 5 year old female puggle got along reasonably well - nothing super concerning and nothing that prepared me for today. I now know he was on a sedative during that meeting - another story for another time.

He was dropped off and after spending one on one time outside with him, I had my mom go get our female so we could take them for a nice walk together. The male immediately started doing what I like to call a ""beagle scream"" when he saw my girl. He grabbed everything he could off the street, including poop, had a master grip, and growled and held on to my finger when I tried to remove food from his mouth. I had to ask my mother for help getting him to release me. Also showed teeth to my girl a few times.

Long story short(ish), we got them both back home and he was a bit of a terror. Screaming unless someone was petting him and getting angry when my girl came in for pets. As he was being vocal and grumpy, my girl was respecting his space when all of a sudden he snapped and tried to bite her right in her face - I've worked with 80+ dogs at once and have developed very quick reaction skills, so I managed to prevent any harmful contact. I know that spats are comment during the adjustment period, but after he snapped things just spiraled and both the dogs were freaking out being completely unfriendly and he even growled at me while we were alone in my room together (after spat, figured we would separate and reintroduce on another walk) when I stopped petting him. All of it was just too much and I knew deep down it was not the right fit nor was it something I could handle long term.

I called M, said it was not the right match for the dogs. M became very rude and angry with me, saying she would not come get him - I told her the environment was not ideal for us or the dogs and that I would be bringing him to her home for her to collect. She said I was greatly inconveniencing her, I apologized. When we got there (my mom and I) she refused to look us in the eye or even turn her body towards us and slammed the door in my mother's face as she tried to explain and apologize. I already felt shattered over how it went down, and this just made me feel even more guilty. 

I guess I'm just asking for reassurance that I made the right decision. I don't know. Sorry this is so long."
345,[Discussion] Has anyone ever adopted a dog before meeting it? Or driven out of state to adopt a dog?,dogs,t3_a8s8z3,14,False,False,a8s8z3,"This could apply to dogs from breeders, as well. 

I understand why rescues want to send dogs to different states if they believe it's going to get a better chance of finder a good family. The group I volunteered for had dogs all the way from Puerto Rico and if a dog had to be returned for whatever reason, it would stay with a foster in-state. 

My only concern is adopting the dog you won't get to meet until after you adopted it. What happens if something unfortunately happened and things don't work out? Does the dog get transported back to it's original rescue or does it stay with a foster? 

Also, would you ever adopt a dog from somewhere outside of your own state? Would it be worthwhile to widen our net? I seem to have better luck finding compatible dogs out-of-state, but my family is worried about something not working out and the driving distance. "

348,[Breeds] Help us choose our future dog!,dogs,t3_a8q4pe,12,False,False,a8q4pe,"**Introduction**

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, my partner and I have both grown up with and still have family dogs (his family has had five different dogs and three for me). But this will be the first dog we own independently.

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Either, I've been struggling with the ethics of breeding but for our ideal dog I am open. 

Describe your ideal dog.

* Friendly, we don't need a guard dog (but don't mind if they think they are) and we would like to have children and other dogs in the future. We love the mixture of cuddly and playful dogs who want some down time but also enjoy playing fetch. Prefer someone trainable (the smarter the better) and we are not fans of barkers. 

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Shar-pei, French Bulldog (we love French Pitbulls or French Staffies)- size, cuteness
* Great Dane (not right now), Lab, Cane Corso- we love big dogs, but they're unrealistic right now. We've both owned labs and loved them (personality, intelligence, playfulness, etc...)

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience/manners, fetch. Beyond that, tricks would be awesome but not required!

**Care Commitments**

How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 20+ minutes of training daily plus 30-60 minute sessions once or twice a week as a puppy
* 20-60 minutes of play, walk, exercise daily
* Lots of interacting and hanging out :)

How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* 20-60 daily minutes of walk/exercise, fetch, tug of war, and dog parks are our exercises of choice. If a dog can swim, even better! (We are willing to dedicate up to 60ish minutes for the right companion, the 20-60 is our willing activity time daily) 

How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We don't mind brushing weekly but much more than that we aren't too interested in. No problem bringing a dog for haircuts but not every week. We are willing to clean ears, brush teeth, and things like that if the dog requires it.

**Personal Preferences**

What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium size (possibly small/medium but not tiny)- My partner plays basketball professionally abroad for 8 months a year. This means we will travel via airplane at least twice a year with the dog (probably not more) and so we are looking for one that this would be reasonable for. We don't mind a medium size dog since it would only be twice a year but nothing large right now. 

How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* We could handle a small amount of shedding but would prefer less or none, minimal slobber and minimal barking.

How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* That would be ideal

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly or in the middle, but we love a good snuggle.

Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A bit of both, but an eager-to-please dog would be fun.

How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* No barking, and visitors shouldn't feel afraid of our dog. We don't mind if they're skeptical but friendly would be fine. We also of course don't mind if the dog barks in an extreme or overly exciting situation.

Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, we would like a dog-friendly dog and plan on getting at least a second dog when we settle down.

Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Constant ""Yippers"" are a no

**Lifestyle**

How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 4 hours at first and then possibly a days work maximum but I currently work from home anyways.

What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* N/A

Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* None currently, but we would like more down the line. Since they will be the first one living with us and having the house to their self, we don't want them to be too territorial (we have also found in our research that certain breeds can be socialized to avoid this trait).

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Eventually but not as a puppy

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We will be renting in the future but we don't know of any breed or weight restrictions and are willing to work to find rentals that will accommodate our dog

What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Barcelona, Spain currently, there are restrictions that just require registration/licensing and lead laws. (Off-season/summer in New England- no restrictions)

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Mild winters in Europe, hot summers in New England (we have the potential to go anywhere in the world for my partner's work so we would prefer a dog that is adaptable to weather)

Today, however, he was around a cluster of dogs when a couple dogs started picking on a berenese mountain dog puppy (maybe 6 months old). Remi got a bit excited when this happened and jumped into the fray and started chasing the pup. He then pinned her down and had her neck in his mouth while she was whimpering. 
I rushed over and grabbed him by the collar. He didn't really resist this. The pup is completely fine but I felt awful. He has never done anything like this before. We left immediately after and Remi didn't act like anything was wrong.

351,[Help] Dog suddenly sleeping with me,dogs,t3_a8kdf9,10,False,False,a8kdf9,"My dog is a 4.5 Year old pit mix and I’ve had her for 4 of those. She’s never been one to sleep with me. When I first got her she’d start out on my bed but eventually move and go somewhere else. For the last three years the routine has always been I go to bed and she stays on the couch. She’s always been welcome on my bed but she’s always preferred to come stand by my bed until I get up. 

There has been a big change for me in terms of jobs which is going to require a lot more travel and she’ll be staying with my parents at those times (they’ve always kept her for me and it’s like a second home for her that she loves) but I haven’t started traveling yet. But that will begin in about a month. However starting this last week when I’m not traveling I’m working from home so I have been home more. 

Anyways a couple of weeks ago I had a bad cold and spent a couple days in bed and that’s when she’d start getting in my bed to sleep around 3/4am and now she does this nightly. I’m ok with it but I’ve just noticed she seems more cuddly and seems to follow me around more.  She’s also started getting on the bed more during the day. 
This week while I’ve been working from home she seemed to need more attention than normal and was following me around a ton. I should add prior to my position change I would work from home some days and that never seemed to throw off our routine - I just do it daily now. She normally is the type of dog that just goes and does her own thing and isn’t one to be underfoot.  Usually when I work from home she spends most of the day in the backyard sunning herself and just checks in periodically. 

Her appetite is still good and we go on daily walks and her energy level seems the same and she doesn’t seem ill but her sudden desire to be more cuddly and have more attention have me slightly concerned. I’m not opposed to it - and I’ve enjoyed our morning cuddles I’m just concerned I’m possibly missing something."

354,[help] Dog goes to sleep right after stress/fear?,dogs,t3_a8raiy,3,False,False,a8raiy,"Hey r/dogs!

This is my first post. I just adopted my first puppy a couple a days ago. She's a 9 week old boxer mix. She sleeps a ton which I know is normal for a pup. When she's awake she loves to play and seems to be a very happy pup. 

Yesterday, I took her to the vet to give her a new-adoption check up. Of course, with all the other dogs there she got a little worried but was still calm and observant. When it was time for us to see the vet, we put her on the table and she seemed sleepy out of no where. She just laid down and got all ""soft"". This worried me and the vet said she was concerned if she continues to be this lethargic. She gave us some antibiotics and pain meds for her recent spaying and asked us to collect a stool sample for her because I mentioned her stool is somewhat soft. 

Here's the weird thing, as soon as I got her home, she was normal and playful. 

Today, she's been her normal self. She ran around and played a lot. Until I had to give her the medicine. She did not do well with it, and spat it out with every trick in the book. So I ended up having to manually give her the pill by placing it on the back of her tongue so she would swallow it. Immediately after, she walked away from me, laid down, and went took a nap.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Thank you in advance!"
355,"[Help] dog beyond terrified of baths, pooped out of fear",dogs,t3_a8r6ls,6,False,False,a8r6ls,"My 75 pound dog has been terrified of baths since he was young, and he’s now 5. I read online about putting treats in the bathroom and then in the tub but that doesn’t work; he will just stand by the door and bark for the treats (steak) all night. He gets so scared during the bathing process that he will ignore food, even his favorite (peanut butter).

Since bathing him in the tub was a nightmare we tried bathing him outside and that worked a bit better but still was horrible and also only works in warm weather.

Then we started bringing him to a self-service dog grooming station. It takes two of us with one person holding him and he tries to escape and shakes the whole time. It’s so sad and brutal. I was pregnant so we couldn’t bath him for like a year since I didn’t want to get injured and now we have a baby so taking him to the self service station isn’t going to happen, not to mention last time we did it was the worst time yet since he now recognizes the parking lot and starts freaking out and trying to escape before we even go inside. 

I asked the vet for anti anxiety meds and we tried to bathe him in our bath tub today but the meds didn’t work. He actually pooped out of fear and we actually never got him in the tub at all. My husband tried to pick him up but he made himself really heavy and kept trying to wriggle away. Then he pooped and we gave up and bathed him with a wet towel, which also terrified him.

Can anyone offer any advice? I’ve tried reading things on the internet but nothing I’ve tried has worked. Of course I don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on baths but I would if anyone knows of any trainers who specialize in baths or bathing companies that work with dogs who hate baths. He was really dirty this last time and it unfortunately results in less pets for him because I hate my hand coming away all brown and greasy. "

358,My dog was attacked and killed by a neighbor's dog [vent],dogs,t3_a8hfhr,35,False,False,a8hfhr,"Ever since I could speak, I've always wanted a puppy/dog and I begged my mom for one incessantly. She always said no but I guess finally caved since she saw how badly I wanted one. My wish came true one Friday when my mother stepped through the door at 10 pm after dog-searching the entire day. She had a small, white and brown, shih tzu-maltese mix in her arms and I was ecstatic. We were attached at the hip since and I played with him everyday. I remember on bad days where I would be in my room crying and he would hear my sobs through the bedroom door, burst in and lick me to death.

&amp;#x200B;

Today at around 11:30 or so, my mom went to go walk him. I usually walk him up the street of our neighborhood because he has some favorite spots there but since my Mom was walking him, she took him downstreet instead. According to my mother's account, she was mere blocks away from bringing my dog home when she saw a young woman open her front door. A large pitbull burst through and quickly sprinted up to my mom and my dog. He bit into his neck and proceeded to maul him as bystanders got out of their cars and tried to help get the pitbull off of him by beating it with a bat or prying its jaws open. Nothing worked.

My mom came home and told me the news and I was in shock. I could hardly register it but once I did I began bawling. My mom drove me down to the neighborhood where it happened and as we were entering the neighborhood, the police were just leaving. They took my dog's body and the pitbull who attacked him. I've been told the pitbull will be euthanized but I'm not sure.

When I arrived, the young woman, who I presume is the owner apologized to me and a man that was standing with her tried to justify it as a ""dog fight"" despite it hardly being a fight. A pitbull randomly attacked my dog and according to witnesses and my mother, my dog just couldn't put up a fight. He didn't stand a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's about 10 hours later and everything seems to be back to normal which is jarring to me. Nobody seems affected by the fact that our dog was killed but me. My brother briefly showed emotion, slamming his fist on the railing when my mom told him what happened but shortly after reverted back to playing video games from morning to night as usual. My dad came home and gave my a hug to comfort me but is watching TV now, like normal. My mom refuses to take any legal action to hold the pitbull owners accountable for what happened. This confuses me because my mom speculates that this was an act of sabotage and that she has been watching us peacefully walk our dog for a long time and set her dog out on ours on purpose....but yet won't hold them responsible for it. This event by all accounts has been swept swiftly under the rug. My mother even offered to buy a new dog of the same breed and gender and name him the same name but I swiftly denied the offer.

I feel like I need closure somehow. I wanted my dog's body so I could atleast bury him close to home but I don't know where they took him. I want the owner to be held accountable for what she did but my mom won't take legal action and her account is the only one that holds any real weight because she was actually there.

I'm just incredibly confused and torn. My dog was an old dog so he was calm and sweet. I've always imagined he would die of old age in his home, surrounded by people who love him so the thought of his final moments on earth being that of suffering tears me apart. I didn't get to say goodbye to him. It hurts me to know that I'll never see him again. I really could use words of comfort and advice on how to move forward right now..

We are a family with young children - ages 5 and 7 - so a child-friendly dog is a must.

We would also prefer a dog that doesn't shed or slobber a lot, however this is negotiable.

We would like a dog that can easily be walked on a leash and can follow basic commands.

**Care Commitments**

1. What size dog are you looking for?

We are unsure on what the perfect size dog would be for our family. It's not a huge factor for us.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I do not want a dog that is constantly barking.  I would prefer to not have to deal with a large amount of shedding and slobber, but that is less important to me than the barking.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

This is not something that we consider largely important.  It would be nice, however our yard is fenced so the times when this would be necessary are minimal.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

We would like a dog that enjoys snuggling but is also fine with doing its own thing.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

An eager to please dog would be good for the children, however we are also fine if the dog is slightly independent.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

We do not want a dog that is going to bark at or be aggressive toward house guests.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, we do not want a dog that is aggressive in any way.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

The biggest factor is finding a dog that will not be aggressive towards the children.

**Lifestyle**

1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

My husband works from home, so the dog will not be left alone for long hours.  However, he will be working and won't be able to be playing with the dog during that time, so the dog will have to be able to be independent enough to tolerate that.  On the weekends, the dog may be left alone for a few hours (3-4) occasionally.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

No one in the family has owned a dog before.  Both adults are willing to be equally involved in caring for the dog, but we are looking for a dog that is good for a first-time owner.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No, we do not plan on having other pets.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, we have two boys ages 5 and 7.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No, we are homeowners.  There are no dog restrictions in our HOA.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in a town just south of Nashville, Tennessee.  There are no laws that we are aware of that ban certain breeds.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

A typical summer day is usually around 90 degrees and a typical winter day is usually around 45.

**Additional Comments**

We have been looking into golden retrievers and came across this dog in particular.  Any comments specifically regarding him would be especially appreciated.

364,[Breeds] Right dog for me?,dogs,t3_a8n0so,10,False,False,a8n0so,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* It will be the second family dog, we have had a black lab before.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescue or reputable breeder is fine.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* A dog that will motivate us to go out on decent 2-3 mile (at least) walks each day, but will calm down and enjoy being petted in the evening.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I'm interested in labradoodles and airedales because I like their ""scruffy"" look and their faces have character. Not necessary, though

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Sit, stay, paw, come over here, fetch, (basic commands), and maybe a simple trick.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I will be at school for most of the day and my parents will be at work, but we can devote time in mornings and afternoons.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* We can exercise the dog around 30 mins to 1 hour on a work day, and closer to 2 on a weekend

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We're willing to trim the dog and things like that every 1-2 months

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large size dog. But not too big, like great dane big. Preferably medium size.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* My mother was tired of the shedding when we had our old dog, so not too much shedding, barking is fine as long as it doesn't just bark randomly (barking when we get home is completely fine), and slobber should just be ""not too much"".

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Kind of important, but we wouldn't do it often anyway.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Definitely a snuggly boi

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* If someone was knocking on door it'd be fine to bark. I'd like the dog to greet them kindly. But I'd not like it to be too friendly. It's funny, our old lab was so nice to visitors but when there were intruders the dog chased them away. Like a sense that someone is bad.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Our social circle has dogs, so no.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* A lot of shedding

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Around 6-8 hrs a day because of us being at work/school

* Our family has similar preferences, they will basically just be walking it and stuff.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We do not have any other pets.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Our social circle has children from ages 6-10 so we need it to be friendly with children.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Not sure what this is. We are not renting property, if that's what it means

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* United States, and I'm aware of the unfair rottweiler restrictions in some areas.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* In miami it can get anywhere from 50º at the very lowest to around 100º so the dog should be able to handle that (it will have access to shade and a pool, however.)

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Unfortunately, getting an older dog won't be an option for us, as we kind of want to raise the dog so we'd want a puppy (don't know if that's relevant but OK)

365,[HELP] When can my puppy go outside into the world?,dogs,t3_a8ox5g,14,False,False,a8ox5g,"I have been adviced by my vet that my Puppy should not go out due to the risk of getting ill without the right vaccination.

She was born on 13 Sept 2018.

She had to get first full vaccination and second on

19 Nov 2018: with Nobivac L4; Nobivac DHP and Nobivac KC for Dogs.

19 Dec 2018: with Nobivac L4; Nobivac DHP

&amp;#x200B;

Now the vet is saying to wait 1 more month for the third shots which I assume will be the KC for Dogs. Not sure.

My question is does it really take 3 months of vaccination to protect your dog from going out into the world, interacting with other dogs and so on?"
366,[Help] Dog has had diarrhea for 2 weeks...,dogs,t3_a8l4ia,14,False,False,a8l4ia,"First, let me say that she has been to the vet. She went last Saturday, had a fecal sample taken (also pooped everywhere after that) and the vet couldn't find anything wrong. He thinks it may be stress. We did have a baby 7 months ago but she's been fine up until now so I don't think that's it. We're going back to the vet xin an hour.

We have a 9 1/2 year old English bulldog. Shes always been quite healthy despite her breed, we've managed her diet and weight well and she's always had a cast iron stomach even after getting into the trash and litter box over the years. She does have food allergies including potatoes, barley, oats, venison, duck and eggs. Potatoes are her biggest one. I can't even remember any time that she's had diarrhea at all, let alone for a prolonged period.
Well, shes now had it on and off for over 2 weeks. We fed her boiled chicken and rice with canned pumpkin for a few days. She was at the vet last Saturday, was prescribed some meds (metrinadozole, fortiflora and one I cant remember) and started to seem better. She wasn't pooping as often but they were still soft. We reintroduced her food Thursday night (about 1/2 the usual amount mixed with white rice and pumpkin) and now she has it again. Shes been eating the food (natural balance lamb and rice) for months now with no issues. It started on a previous bag so I don't think we bought a bad one.
I know the vet said there wasn't anything apparent but there has to be something wrong for her to be this sick for so long. She's older....there has to be something. She's now peeing in the house too because she's been having poo accidents. 
Had anyone ever had this happen? We are going back to the vet today in an hour. Should I ask about prescription food? Should I ask about other tests? I don't know what to do....

Help please!

Update: Vet ran bloodwork and thinks its IBD. We're going to treat her for it and see if she improves at all by next Saturday. She's on prescription food for now. If she doesn't improve with steroids and the new food, he thinks it could be something else but we will take it one step at a time. "
367,[Help] My GSD (9moF) bit my husband today.,dogs,t3_a8ockm,17,False,False,a8ockm,"DH (32M) and I (30F) bought a GSD bitch 4 weeks ago from an elderly mother and daughter. When we came to pick her up, she hadn't been walked in a week. They really underestimated the time and energy a pup like her needs.




Anyway, we have 2 boys (8 &amp; 3) and she is incredible with them. Knows exactly how hard she can play with each of them and has the patience of a saint.




Unfortunately, she goes batsh*t insane at every passerby and every dog that wanders into her line of sight. Apparently, the older ladies that had her before never socialised her. But, we've been working with the local dog walkers to try and get her used to other people and dogs. So far, she's been doing really well; has taken a liking to a local Aussie Shep, and the older ladies in the group even loaned us a Thundershirt for her nerves :)




But we had an incident today. She was on her lead, playful but not overexcited, and an off-lead dog came straight up to her with no owner nearby. During the tussle, she got her teeth around something and went for it. Unfortunately, it was DH's hand. Not a bad bite, but enough to draw blood.




This is where I need some advice. What do?! She needs socialisation but she goes utterly nuts as soon as people move in an unpredictable way or if they even look at her. She has no tolerance for any other dogs (but ducks and cats are fine 🙃) She's just so nervous and scared of EVERYTHING.




How do I help her?

372,[help] dog is limping,dogs,t3_a8ndr4,0,False,False,a8ndr4,"Juliet, a 5 year old pit mix mix, has been favoring her back right leg for a week now. She has had limps before, I'd say once or twice a year on average in a 4 year span, that the vet diagnosed as a inflammation or a ligament issue.

I decided to wait and see if the limp would get any better before going to see the vet this time. She has shown signs of improvement but she still favors the back right leg. I'm going to taker her into the vet to make sure everything is ok.

But over the past couple hours he’s just been acting very sluggish like depressed almost.

382,[Vent] Sister's Inappropriate Treatment of the Dog,dogs,t3_a8ky0w,1,False,False,a8ky0w,"Background: I moved in and began renting from my dad and stepmom a year and a half ago in order to finish school. I have my own room, but due to family dynamics, I can't be completely independent, such as buying my own food and feeling like an actual tenant. As such, I've begrudgingly became involved when they bought a cockapoo puppy from a breeder shortly after I moved in. I didn't really want to become attached because I know how my family is with dogs.

The main reason we got Bo was because my younger half sister, who is 12, was desperate for a dog. Right off the bat there was no training invested in this puppy, and he still has regular accidents in the house (we got him 09/01/2017). My little sister became very attached and was convinced for awhile that Bo was her dog. That meant trying to change his name (tried calling him Bear, Bo-bo, or Bobby during that period where we were trying to teach Bo his name is Bo), wanting to involve him in everything (I have a picture of her taking a bath with the dog), and treating this poor dog like a baby. She would hold him like you would a human child and feed him treats or just carry him around. It's obvious Bo is obviously uncomfortable being cradled but my little sister thinks he's a toy? He has a relationship with her that's mainly reward driven, because my little sister is NOTORIOUS for feeding him from the dinner table. Every time I stand up from eating dinner, I can see her with a hand under the table letting Bo eat or lick from it. My parents don't really discipline her in this regard besides telling her no, which doesn't seem to mean much.

The biggest infraction is the way my sister touches Bo. Although I think I've shamed her enough from doing this because I haven't seen it recently, my little sister inappropriately pets Bo on his groin and genital area. Bo likes belly rubs, what dog doesn't? Except my sister takes this as it being okay to sort've finger and touch Bo on his penis. It is *incredibly* disturbing to see her do this. I'm not sure if this was intentional or if she did it absent-mindedly, because she seemed to pet this part of his body the same way as his ears or back, but maybe with some childish fascination. 

Regardless, she doesn't seem to understand the severity that it is not an appropriate place to touch the dog.  I am worried that this may have some impact on how the dog acts, especially around women. He reacts far differently when I come home vs. my brother or dad. When I go to pet him hello, he will be... physically excited (boner) and usually pees out of excitement. I don't know if these problems are related. I've tried to control him by making him wait before I pet him, but I am hardly home and worry about what else my little sister could be doing to him."

Mom and dad have two Dobermans: Tallulah is super chill and can get along with anyone and Lemmy is very silly and sweet but isn't a fan of other dogs. I will be introducing my rescue mutt (maybe red heeler/golden mix?) Jorah to the mix. Jorah is okay with other dogs when I'm not around such as at daycare, but seems to feel the need to protect me from most (not all) other dogs who come too close. My concern is that Lemmy and Jorah won't get along and we will have to keep them separated in the already pretty small house, which definitely isn't the ideal situation. My parents live on about half an acre, so the yard is nice and big. Lemmy and Lulah play together outside and I'd love to see Jorah added to the mix to have fun, too.

Jorah met Lulah and Lemmy on Thanksgiving when my parents came to visit in their RV. This happened in neutral territory. Lulah and Jorah were okay after an initial squabble. Lemmy and Jorah continued to snap and snarl at each other for most of the visit (the dobies stayed in the RV and Jorah stayed at my house). There were a couple of times that Jorah and Lemmy had good proximity and they were fine, which I hope means they will learn to get along and live together.

Só a lot has changed since my last pup.  Grain free was the responsible choice, especially Canadian-sourced foods like Acana and Origen. 

Now I’m being told that GF may actually be dangerous for dogs, and may lack the nutrition they need.  My pup is a rescue with a history of Heartworm so I want to keep her heart healthy and strong.

I also want to avoid big brands that, I believe, skirt as close to as cheaply made as possible.  If GF is no longer safe that’s fine; I still don’t want to feed Purina or Hills which have all kinds of bullshit in their feed.

What are some good brands and solutions here?  My pup does have allergies to some of the fillers in food, so her current brand (a limited ingredient diet from Go!) has helped a ton with itching and biting herself.

Any help you can offer would be great, or resources for me to review would be helpful too.

Thanks in advance from me and Eleanor!!"
386,"[Help] Shiba Woes, A multitude of puppy problems",dogs,t3_a8jb3j,9,False,False,a8jb3j,"So I recently got a Shiba Inu puppy, she's 9 weeks old. It wouldn't be a big deal in it's own right because I have a three year old Shiba I have trained easy enough but I have hit a wall with this one. I've trained Mastiffs, Huskies, and Dobermans as well.

She's no warning peeing in excess of 5 times an hour. She doesn't sniff or waddle, just play then random piss. I'll take her out right away and she'll pee again, maybe twice. 

She's a gremlin, the way she plays stresses out my timid and polite older dog. Demon growling and biting. My older dog is too shy and submissive to tell her no. 

I can't train her with my older dog. I tried shutting my older in the bed room and vice versa but she just jealous barks and yips through door. I was trying to teach the younger to lay down with my older in her bed across the living room. And the older jealous barked and growled at me for a full five minutes. She's never growled at a person until I was trying to teach the puppy something. 

I'm freaking out about it. I honestly don't know what to do. Any ideas?"
387,[Help] Tips on getting a dog used to a second dog visiting the house?,dogs,t3_a8jm7t,0,False,False,a8jm7t,"Hi /r/dogs. Any tips on getting my resident dog (Roxy) more comfortable with another dog (almost daily playmate, Alfi) in our house? Roxy is fairly anxious and reactive in general, but very good friends with Alfi and his owners. We recently went round Alfi's house with Roxy and they got on great, although Roxy did briefly guard a hoof that she found, growled at Alfi and Alfi backed off and left her alone until we could remove the hoof. No further problems occurred; they played a lot as they usually would when we meet at the local dog park, and both were pretty good at communicating ""dude, calm down"" when the other wanted to play and they didn't.

However, we figure things might be trickier in our own home. We've had a few other dogs briefly in the house and Roxy tends to get very stressed and reactive. I feel this will be better with Alfi, but is there anything we can do to make it easier? E.g., have Alfi explore our house when Roxy isn't there, etc. (And the ""obvious"", like remove any items that Roxy might guard, no feeding in the same room, give both places to go if they need space/rest.)

For the record, the long term idea is that we might be able to dogsit for each other, for various reasons. Thanks for any advice!"

On to my question: I was walking my dog with a friend, when I saw a person with a large dog walking towards us. I crossed the road and distracted my dog with treats to make sure she did't freak out. 

My friend suggested that crossing the street was rude, since the person might now think that I was avoiding them for some reason.

I train my puppy to go toilet using a puppy pee pads which I intend to move outside eventually. 

The success is that he uses the pads a lot more than he goes places he shouldn't. I think it's because of this spray I use on the pads to make them more attractive for him to use. I think the failure is because he is only using the pads because of the spray and not because of me training him correctly.

When ever he uses the pads I try to give him a treat and provide positive verbal reinforcement but when I try to go near him he moves away

396,[Help] My rescue isn't what the foster described.,dogs,t3_a8cken,46,False,False,a8cken,"We adopted a rescue 3 weeks ago. He is a 6-7 month old German Shepherd/Lab mix (My second German). We filled out an application and were in contact with the foster a few days later. We met him, he barked at us twice and came inside our house. We met him in our house which I think was part of the issue.

Prior to the meet we asked the foster how he was with strangers. We were assured he was timid at first but totally fine and loved to give kisses. Our biggest requirement was that he was good with people. My wife has had a bad experience in the past with a larger dog (big bite on the calf and scar) and wanted to make sure this aspect with strangers wouldn't trigger the dog. Since all this checked out she agreed to the adoption. 

Two weeks in and my sister in law comes over and the dog unleashes hackles, does a charge, and doesn't let her move from the wall. I am mortified, I can call him back no issue, but cant get him to stay. I finally crate him and do an oh-f@ck.

I contacted the foster and she tells me he did best starting in his crate and it was a ""better"" experience. ""Come again?""  Turns out the foster's husband was intimidated by the dog and so they deceived to get him placed. Had my wife known this she would have never agreed to adopt him. We wouldn't be in this situation at all. 

Add on that we told the foster we need a dog walker 2-3 days a week and were told it wouldn't be an issue. Now I am scared to leave him in the hands of a walker until he is more socialized with people. I've rearranged my work schedule to be home in the afternoon to let him out and walk him. He did fine in day care, but I can't do that 3 days a week.

All her fears have come to the surface and she is afraid to touch the dog. He didn't recognize her one evening and barked at her while running towards her and she broke down in tears. I have a great relationship with the pup and love him to pieces, but I can't do this to my wife. 

I travel for work from time to time and I don't feel comfortable leaving her with him. He senses her fear and becomes uncontrollable. I can work with the dog, but like I told my wife I can't give her a guarantee that he can fully diminish his fear of strangers. I've become the mediator.

I feel like a complete failure and sick to my stomach because I love that pup, but I love my wife even more and can't subject her to this. Now I don't know what to do. The foster won't take him back on account of her husband. The rescue has yet to respond. He is an amazing dog who would do well once socialized with people, but he needs someone who can guide him and isn't intimidated by him. 

I just need advice. I made a commitment to the pup, but I also have a commitment to my wife.

398,[Discussion] My 11 year old golden retriever's grain-free diet related heart problem is better after 6 months of heart meds and taurine supplements!,dogs,t3_a86iko,207,False,False,a86iko,"Long Post Warning, but I think it’s worth posting about and want to be thorough!

*Note: I’m using the veterinarian’s exact diagnosis throughout this post, as she would email me all her notes every time we would go for a checkup.*

TLDR: My 11 year old golden retriever was diagnosed with congestive heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which turned out to be due to her life long grain free diet and the critically low levels of taurine it caused. After six months of medication, taurine supplements and swapping her to dog food that is not grain free, she now has a healthy heart and is off all of her medication and supplements! And, she's got more pep in her step then she's had in at least a year!

Edit: spelling

Edit: thank you for the gold!

—

Our 11 year old golden retriever Lilly has been a happy and healthy gal her whole life,  say except for a rock swallowing incident when she was about 4 years old and a few bad earaches that turned out to be due to a thyroid problem that’s been managed by medication for a couple of years now.

These last 6 months, though, they have been pretty tough. After a few, what we thought were minor issues and a few vet visits, we were hoping we were yet again being overly cautious when we took Lilly back to the vet in June. She had been coughing, had lost a lot of weight even though she was eating (being picky but still eating, nonetheless) and just seemed off… Unfortunately, it turned out that we weren’t being overly cautious. Something was wrong and our vet wanted us to take Lilly to the local emergency/specialty clinic right away. We knew she had quite a bit of fluid around her heart, but by the end of the night the admitting ER vet was discussing everything from potential cancer to even putting her down. We decided the plan of action would be to drain the fluid and see what we were up against and go from there.

Here is the exact diagnosis from Lilly’s specialist, at the clinic:

*Based on today's evaluation, we have diagnosed Lilly with congestive heart failure secondary to a heart muscle disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM. In Lilly’s case, the degree of changes to the heart are severe, and congestive heart failure (retention of fluid) has developed. After diagnosis of heart failure due to this disease, the average survival is about 3 months, though some dogs do not respond well to therapy and some dogs live well for much longer times (even years).*

Three different medications (Lasix 50mg, Enalapril 10mg and Vetmedin 10mg)/ three pills, twice a day was what we were sent home with. That, and the best-worst-case scenario we could have got. It wasn’t cancer, and at least we could try to keep her feeling better, and pray for the best outcome. 3-6 months (which was average) left with her was not what we were wanting, but at least we wouldn’t have to put her down right away. We were going to enjoy whatever time we had left with her.

Next check up comes a few weeks later and this is where it gets interesting. (If you’ve hung in this long, keep going) Lilly had perked up and was doing well on her meds. Our doctor at the Specialty Clinic was pleased with how she’s doing, and we end up discussing Lilly’s diet- specifically if she was on a grain free diet. She was her whole life, up until about March 2018, and I only stopped the grain free diet because I thought she was getting picky in her old age, so I was trying anything to get her to eat… Here again is her specialist’s exact notes at this visit:

*Lilly’s case is very interesting in the fact that she has been on a grain free diet historically. As discussed today, there has been a trend in veterinary medicine with grain free diets and development of dilated cardiomyopathy, particularly in Golden Retrievers. Although the mechanism is not known as to why this is starting to occur, if low taurine is identified, supplementation with taurine would be recommended. With taurine deficiency related dilated cardiomyopathy, the prognosis may be improved with supplementation. We have sent taurine levels out today to investigate if supplementation is needed for Lilly.*

Here’s the thing- we had Lilly on a grain free diet because we thought that’s what we were “supposed” to do. Only the best for our girl, right? You’d have to be living under a rock to not see all of these grain-free pet food commercials. It seemed like the responsible thing a pet owner should do for their 4-legged companion, but after speaking with the specialist she suggested we stop feeding Lilly AND our other two year old golden retriever grain free food right away. She let me know that there’s not been any studies showing grain-free is any better than food with grain in it, and unless your dog has some sort of legit reason to not eat food with grain it in, there’s really no benefit from doing it.

When Lilly’s taurine level panel came back, it was pretty alarming. Normal range for a dog is 60-150 nmol/mL (whatever that means). Critical level is less than 40. Lilly was at a 15!

Specialist’s exact diagnosis:

*I am so happy to report that Lilly’s taurine levels came back at a critically low level, indicating that this may be the reason for the dilated cardiomyopathy. I would like to start supplementing her with 2000 mg twice daily of taurine and would like to recheck echocardiogram in 3 months. Typically in taurine-responsive DCM, we expect a generally longer prognosis than in idiopathic DCM and our best hope would be to able to reverse the cardiac changes and be able to wean the cardiac medications and just maintain on taurine. Lilly's grain-free diet has already been stopped (important as this has been recently implicated in possibly causing the taurine deficiency).*

6 pills in the morning and 6 pills in the evening, supplementing with taurine and taking 3 different medications for her heart.

Three months later Lilly went to her normal (amazing) vet, for her normal yearly check-up and things seemed pretty good! She was tolerating her meds well. We were happy. Normal vet was happy and after getting her check-up results, Specialist was happy. They told us to keep it up and we would check her again in 3 months.

Last week Lilly went in for that six month check up. I’m not going to lie, we were nervous. We had made peace knowing that if these test results did not come out the way we were hoping that we had 6 incredible months with Lilly, where we really got to love on her and learn from her, but we were praying for not just good results, but great results. Still, in the waiting room, I was nervous.

I couldn’t have possibly imagined how that visit would go, but miraculous is a great word to describe it! After 6 months of supplementing her with taurine and giving her the heart medications she wasn’t just doing good, she **is** doing great!!!

Her specialist’s exact diagnosis:

*We are beyond pleased to report that Lilly's echocardiogram is now normal, with the diet change, medications and taurine supplementation. Her cardiac ultrasound now shows a very normal heart. Therefore, we can discontinue her cardiac medications and taurine and continue her current diet. Her prognosis is now great and she does not have any residual evidence of heart disease. Wonderful news for sweet Lilly!!*

No more congestive heart failure!!! Our girl has a healthy heart and we are beside ourselves with joy and praise and thankfulness for answered prayers!

This has been a long post, but it’s been a long six months. As many of you surely know on this sub, there is now an FDA investigation into a potential connection between diet and cases of canine heart disease. The internet, like always, is fuuuuuuuull of opinions. I not only have an opinion but have first-hand experience, and it’s worth sharing. This happened to Lilly. This is not just a post on the internet now, my girl went through this.

&amp;#x200B;

I would bet that all of y’all on this sub love your dogs like we love ours and I want everyone to know what happened here. Maybe this will help someone else, if not about choosing what type of dog food to buy, then giving you something to consider if your dog is having these type of heart issues, then perhaps it would be worth getting a taurine panel ran. But, beyond this, don’t get caught up in the latest and greatest, just because everyone else is doing it. You got to do what is right for you and your dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry to ramble, but thanks for reading. If you have any questions, I'll be glad to try to answer as best that I can- if not tonight, I'll check back tomorrow and as needed.

400,[Help] Just adopted 1 year old shiba. How can I be a good mom?,dogs,t3_a8jhgk,2,False,False,a8jhgk,"Hello! Long story short, our previous tenant abandoned his 1 year old shiba inu and my family has decided to adopt it. I've been watching videos and reading articles on how to care and train for a puppy, but it's a bit overwhelming. Some facts:  
1. He's about 1 year old  
2. Never trained  
2. He's an outdoors dog but we'd like to transition him to being an indoors dog.   
3. I don't live here, so it'll be my dad training and taking care of the dog once I leave after the holidays. He primarily speaks Chinese, so if there are any Chinese language resources (trainers, videos, meetups in the San Francisco Bay Area) that would be great.

I'm basically starting at square one as I've never raised a shiba puppy before. I'd love some advice on:  
1. How much time should we expect to spend on training, socializing, and exercising at first, then per day after he gets the basics down?   
2. How to train and socialize him. Do it myself, hire a trainer, what basic things to start with. Anything particular to shibas I should know?   
3. Living situation - inside garage, inside house, in crate, in pen?  
4. Day to day what's your routine? Also how often do you get them groomed, go for a vet checkup, to the dog park, etc?  
5. Any other shiba specific things I should know or watch out for?  
6. Any recs for food, treats, toys, bed, etc.   
7. What to do with the pup when everyone's at work to keep him occupied/not anxious?  
8. Name ideas! :)   
9. Any resources - puppy classes, youtube channels, trainers in the area, podcasts, blogs, books  
10. Diet  
11. Cost - how much should we expect to spend?

I'm don't live in the Bay Area at the moment, so my dad will be the one spending the most time with him and reinforcing the training after I leave. We'll see how that goes and if he's not able to do that, I might take him up to Seattle with me.

Sydney showed up in a rural shelter near us, marked ""urgent"", on a weekend when my partner was out of town.  She was a scrawny little ragamuffin, but I'm so glad I saw past that and trusted my instincts.  Her personality just sparkled, even in the concrete cage.  It took her one day to win over our other dog, and about one month to wrap herself around my partner's heart.  Her first photo album is [here](https://imgur.com/a/BT1k8).

Since then, she's earned her Canine Good Citizen title (unpracticed, on her first try, by the skin of her teeth!), eagerly traveled on all our ski trips, and turned into a happy [little camper](https://imgur.com/Rc0i6y8).

As well he's very good about letting us know when he wants to go to the backyard so I'm pretty sure this is some quirk he's got going on.  And besides our other dogs haven't gone in the house since they were pups.

Suggestions for getting him to stop?"

we have another dog who has no issues with separation or house training.the one with the problem is maybe 5 or 6 and had spent two years in the shelter before we adopted her. she has minor issues but the peeing is the worst, she is ruining our carpet. both of us work from home which I think makes our leaving more stressful. it doesn't matter if we just walked her or if we restrict water, it doesn't matter if we are gone 5 minutes or 5 hours, she will pee. I'm afraid forcing her into a crate will cause more issues and separating the dogs will probably not go over well. they have really bonded. "

I have a lot of worries about leaving her for 3 weeks at the kennels while we’re gone, mainly about how she’s going to do there as this is the first time my whole family won’t be around her for weeks. She’s used to me being gone for weeks on end due to uni but she’s always had my family around and I’m just really really worried and have feelings of anxiety about leaving her. 

We tried finding friends who would be able to take care of her while we’re gone but most of them either already have dogs of their own (and I don’t want to bother them with another one) or they’re also going away while we’re gone.

I guess I just need some sort of reassurance and any advice anyone has when it comes to leaving their dogs at someone else’s care for the first time. Thanks in advance!"

Bleeding started gradually a few days ago;  I bought some diapers to keep it from getting all over the house, but the bleeding has intensified.  The diapers have a lot of blood drops after just a couple hours of wearing.  When I take them off, there's like a buildup and some drips fall on the floor as she's walking around.

She seems happy and healthy as usual, but it seems like an awful lot of blood.  I'd rather not go to the vet and pay a ton of money getting her checked out.

Does anyone have experience with dogs in heat that knows how much blood is expected?  Without the diapers she licks so it seems like less blood, but with the diapers she can't lick so I'm thinking it just seems like a lot of blood to me.  Is this normal or should I pay a vet to check her out?"

416,[Help] Visiting Family for the winter break. How to prevent my dogs from regressing on their crate habits? and not cry in new situations?,dogs,t3_a8hrb0,3,False,False,a8hrb0,"Hello,

So I'm visiting family for the winter break and I brought my dogs with me and their crates. We will be staying at my families home where there are two other pugs here. 

The dogs get along ok. Not perfect they tolerate each other. while supervised, but when my dogs want to start playing the pugs don't like and they all start getting feisty. The problem I'm fearing is that when we all go out, I don't want to leave the dogs alone with the pugs in case a fight breaks out. So I will be keeping them in a separate room and in their crates while we are away. The thing is that any time that I'm away and the pugs are walking around. My dogs begin to cry while in their crates. 

My dogs used to do this when I first got them, but since I live alone in an apartment, when I left my apartment and left them in their crates they would just go to sleep and relax, but with other dogs walking around outside of their room they get agitated and want to be let out, so they cry. I'm afraid that they will regress back and start crying in their crates when I leave when I'm back at my apartment. If they do regress then that will cause a lot of noise complaints.

Is there a way to prevent this? I'm thinking that a solution is just to keep the pugs in another room, where they can't walk near my dogs while they are in their crate, but there will be time when I leave the house and family members and the pugs will still walk around the house, and I don't trust the dogs to just walking around freely in the house without agitating the pugs or vice versa, so ideally I'd like to keep them separated unless I'm personally supervising them. Unfortunately, I don't think my siblings want to supervise my dogs while I'm away.

Any suggestions or solutions will be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!"
417,"[Help] Dog has constsnt discharge. Not too sure what it is, niether does the vey.",dogs,t3_a8e7bv,14,False,False,a8e7bv,"Was wondering if anyone else has come across this issue and knew what this was 

My adopted dog (a little over a year) has consistent vaginal? discharge all the time.  It's kind of cloudy and stringy (it all wants to stay together in one piece) and it really smells.  Almost like metal.  While constant it gets worse at times in terms of frequency and then becomes less frequent.  I wouldn't call it cyclical bit it changes in how often it happens.  It gets really bad some weeks. Other dogs seem really interested in it and like to smell it (gross).

I do notice that sometimes she has the discharge start before she needs to go out to pee.

I've been to my vet multiple times and they don't know what it is.  They confirmed that it's sterile and not an infection and it's not hurting my pup.  It's just kind of gross, gets  on everything and I would like to stop it if possible.  It can't be great for her- and she is constantly licking it/eating it.

It's not a UTI or stump pyometra.

Anyone have this issues before?  Any suggestions on what it could be/ how to fix this?

Extremely inappropriate or am I overreacting?,dogs,t3_a87n61,32,False,False,a87n61,"My partner and I got a mixed-breed puppy in March 2017. I emphasize mixed-breed to make clear we didn't get it from a breeder, this was just a middle-aged couple whose own dogs had had a ""happy accident"".

Now, when they came to hand over the puppy (we even paid for it, signed a contract etc.) the wife was quite emotional - cried, even. They have eight other dogs at home and Just got this litter of three - if it had been her way I'm sure she would have wanted to keep them too, but I suspect her husband had the last say. Since they came over to visit us to see if the pup would be getting a good home, they now knew our address. 

Since then, the lady has continuously attempted to contact us and arrange a visit several times per year. At one point, around our dog's first birthday, she called and asked if she can come over and bring him a toy. We said it's not a good idea. She said ""Oh but I'm in the neighborhood, it'll only be a few minutes!"". We said we're going to see family and are getting ready to leave. That was the end of it, or so we thought. 

My partner's sister came to pick us up and as we got into the car she said ""X was just here asking if I lived here and could let her into the building. I said I'm just waiting to pick you up and she flustered and said 'oh you must be Y's sister, you look so alike!' Then she gave me the present for Pup and left.""

So apparently she thought we were lying/hurried over regardless and was looking for a way to get in and catch us at home. I freaked out. But anyway, after that there was radio silence for a while and I thought she got the message that this isn't her dog anymore and she should back off. Until a few months back, when she tried to call my partner again, several times. Then texted him, asking if we could meet up. He didn't reply.

Yesterday we got a Christmas card from her, her husband and ""the doggies"". Nice gesture if it had come from anyone else, but for me personally now it just makes my blood boil. I'm having nightmares that this woman will somehow, some day, make her way into our building, knock on our door and kidnap our dog once we open. I'm overexaggerating, I know, but I am kinda angry, so forgive me.

422,[Help] Scarf and barf solutions?,dogs,t3_a8engn,7,False,False,a8engn,"Anyone who's dealt with scarf and barf before, what solutions did you find that worked?    

I have a ~2.5 year old lab/pit mix.  I've had her for about 2 years.  For these 2 years I have fed her the same food throughout.  Always one cup in the morning and one in the evening.    

Over the past ~2 months or so, I have been coming home multiple times a week to her vomit which is primarily whole pieces of her food still in tact.  It started out infrequently but seems to be happening more often now.    

I called my vet and they said it sounded like classic scarf and barf.  My dog definitely would eat her food as quickly as possible and was not chewing most of it.  I bought a ""puzzle"" bowl per their recommendation and it has slowed down her eating considerably.  However, she is still not chewing the majority of the meal - she just picks up a couple pieces, swallows, repeats.  Then a few hours later she starts drooling, vomits, and then drools for hours afterwards.

Anyone have any suggestions on how to get her to chew her food instead of swallowing?  I considered changing her food but I don't think that's the issue as she was fine eating this food for almost 2 years.  Also, it seems to be the morning meal that usually ends up coming back up, not the evening meal.  Though the problem has still happened a couple times after the evening meal.  Other than this, she seems fine.  No noticeable changes in behavior or discomfort, she still seems like herself and is always up for some play and attention.

Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.  Thanks and happy Holidays! "
423,[Discussion] TIL what a low battery chirp on a smoke detector can do psychologically to your dog,dogs,t3_a8fp9v,4,False,False,a8fp9v,"My dog Timber has anxiety that he’s on medication for. He gets very nervous sometimes and shakes but what I experienced today seemed very abnormal for him. 

I put him in his kennel before I left for an appointment this morning. I got home about 2 hours later and we immediately went for a walk. He was fine our whole walk. But upon arriving home, he was glued to my side, panting excessively, and shaking very hard. I sat down on the couch and he wanted to be on top of my lap. This went on for an hour or so before I ran to the store to get dinner. The behaviors continued when I got home. 

I decided to call my vets on call number. They advised me to sit with him for a half hour or so and if the behaviors didn’t settle to call back so that he could be seen. While I was sitting there, trying to calm Timber down, I heard the smoke detector in the hall chirp. I immediately ran to pull the battery out. And my dog is suddenly fixed! He is fine now and cuddled up at my side.  

I feel SO terrible that he had to listen to that chirp all day and I couldn’t help him sooner. I found articles about this exact situation and apparently they’re called noise phobias. This is something that has ever even occurred to me! Has anyone else had this issue with their pups?"

425,[Update] [Help] No solution | Sick Dog,dogs,t3_a8h4ls,1,False,False,a8h4ls,"My original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/a5es23/helpvent\_sick\_dog/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/a5es23/helpvent_sick_dog/)

&amp;#x200B;

I took my big boy last week to the vet, his side issue wasn't major and there was nothing too much to stress about. Just his eating issue which is now solved. Two days ago I woke up with puddles of blood over the house, this isn't an exaggeration, there was blood on the walls, on the floor, all over him, and I was just lost and confused and angry, I didn't understand what was going on. Last week, the vet had given him a steroid shot and antibiotics, and somehow instead of bettering his condition it got way worse and caused whatever was is infesting his side to rupture. I rushed to the vet with him gushing blood nonstop.

&amp;#x200B;

They did **nothing**. They gave me more medications racking up to 300$ which he can't start until he finishes his current antibiotic. They did a culture and we wont know anything until after Christmas. They want me to come in early in the morning tomorrow for a check up, I have no money anymore as the last two visits have been 600$, I have no way of paying anything. I'm in massive debt from trying to obtain solutions for my buddy for over 3 months now. I've spent over 2k trying to find out what's wrong with his side and no one has been able to give me an answer. To this day I have no answer. I'm a college student, I work as seasonal with minimum wage; I come in put on a smile no matter how much I'm suffering from my personal life and work extremely hard in hopes of getting a regular job there and have some kind of financial income. I keep picking up any shift in the hopes of saving my dog, I don't even care if I work there 5 days straight double shifts, it just means I have more money to put towards my pet. My family is in major financial trouble, we even lost power yesterday and we had to scrounge up the little money we had to pay the electric bill.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the vets have decided they don't want to operate on him since I've brought it up last visit and kept asking for an estimate, according to them it's because the problem is so large, there's no way to connect the skins back together, since they have to remove **more** than 8x8in of skin. I don't know how the vets could've let this get so bad, I don't understand how they don't know what's going on. They tell me not to clean him, not to leave him outside, he's wearing a cone to prevent him from licking his side, he's frustrated and I understand that he is, I'm frustrated myself. I don't want to give him up, I've lost literally any hope in my life for him. I'm scared of tomorrow, I sincerely have no desire for it to come.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm doing something wrong because I'm doing everything people tell me today, get a job, pay for the problem, work more hours, more money. Go to a vet, problem solved. Go to school, everything will get better.

&amp;#x200B;

Things only keep getting worse and worse and worse, and I just can't. I don't want him to get euthanized, but I don't even have money to help him, the vets have drained the last cent and my own mom says I'm being irresponsible and that he's a very sick dog that needs help to drop him. It's like she's ignored everytime I've taken him to the vet?? But I've done as much as I possibly can and more than any rescue is willing to do. I can't make a solution appear out of thin air?? I took him to the vet and the vet doesn't know the answer, what more could I possibly do!?

I've called the ONLY TWO vet dermatologists in town and they are ALL booked until January, they don't accept emergencies and the one time they were willing to bring me in, was 220$ at the door just to see the doctor, after that it was whatever examinations, tests, etc they would want to add. They estimated over the phone over 600$. I had less than 7$ in my bank account, and my credit cards were already maxed. I wanted to curl up and scream my life out. I don't know what else to do, there has to be a solution. There just has to be, I wish I just had it right in front of me."

428,[help] Advice on potty training,dogs,t3_a8exth,2,False,False,a8exth,"Hey! So I just adopted a dog last week. He is about a year old and a hound mix. His name is Tucker, and Tucker has been great with me! I live in an apartment and he has not had a single accident there. However the three times I’ve brought him over friends houses he has peed on their rugs or ottoman. He doesn’t go to the door or indicate he needs to be let out and will pee even if he was just out a half hour ago. I feel like he’s having issues transferring his skills from my apartment where he is perfect to other homes. Any advice on how to help him with this? I know he’s still new and since he was picked up as a stray I know nothing of his past but I want to be able to bring him with me wherever I go and would like to be able resolve this issue. Thanks! "
429,[Help] Young dog with old dog syndrome - occasional vertigo and nystagmus,dogs,t3_a8ex5h,7,False,False,a8ex5h,"Age? 6y

Country? US

Breed? Pit bull

Sex? F(s)

Dogs weight? 50lb

Food? Corn free (allergy) dry 1 go cup per day for past 5y with occasional home cooked stew of rice, sweet potatoes, 
peas, and turkey or salmon

Are you up to date with the vaccinations? Yes, good

Have you looked at the teeth? Yes, good - chews a lot of hard nylabones, very hard chewer

Have you looked at the poop? Solid? Soft? Yes, good

Vomit? Literally never since I've had her

Drink? Water intake good

Dewormed? With annual shots

Other details? Very short badly cropped ears (rescue, I did not crop her ears!!) but no diagnosed ear infections or other ear issues

My female pit bull started having balance problems about a year ago. I got her when she was about 9mo old, and she's always been a little goofy. But over the course of a few months, she became really clumsy - occasionally bump into things, miss the bottom stair on her way out, things like that. Took her to the vet for a whole workup, and everything came back fine. Eyes, ears, bloodwork, all good. No nausea, vomiting, or other functional problems at all, but she seems to have gradually gotten more unstable. 

Like she'll attempt to jump on the couch and fall straight back or shake her head and have to pause before she moves to keep from falling over. She's only fallen all the way over a couple times, she usually just leans to the side for a sec till she can correct herself. As long as she is walking/running in a straight line, she's good. It's sudden changes in direction, elevation, or going from lying on her side to standing straight up that are problematic. She doesn't have any head tilt at all, but the nystagmus is pretty pronounced. 

Everyone I've talked to so far has said old dog syndrome till they find out how young she is. Others have said a possible tumor or lesion. I guess I was just wondering if anyone has had a young dog experience old dog disease symptoms and what the outcome was. Can younger dogs have persistent vertigo (BPPV) with no underlying cause like humans? The way she acts honestly reminds me of my dad and aunt who've had vertigo their entire adult lives... just runs in the family."
430,[Discussion] Suddenly Really Anxious about a Board and Train,dogs,t3_a8entz,41,False,False,a8entz,"I’ve been looking forward to sending my bullmastiff x pit to a specialized trainer for a board and train (10+ days) to learn some advanced tasks and become solidly public-ready CGC-style (*again*—he backslid when I started graduate school and didn’t have time to train as much). I scheduled it way back in early June (because that’s seriously how booked this trainer is; he’s currently booked through August), and I’ve been super excited ever since, and I’ve been putting back the money for it for a couple months.

However, now that he’s supposed to leave in a week, I’m freaking out a little. I’ve only been away for him for a week once and maybe for 2-4 days a handful of times since I got him four years ago. He’s my shadow, and I spend a LOT of time focusing on him and his wellbeing daily. I can’t imagine him being gone for potentially up to two weeks.

I guess I just wanted some support because I’m becoming increasingly anxious and have even considered canceling several times (although I won’t). For the past week or so I constantly catch myself delivering hypothetical monologues to my trainer regarding his extensive list of commands and care etc. I think I’m slowly driving myself nuts worrying about this even though I feel confident he’s going to have a blast and come back as lovely as ever.

Edit: Since I specifically asked for support but instead received mostly skepticism, I guess I should jump into the details I decided not to bore you with.

Firstly, I’ve been seeking a qualified trainer in my area for years, and I’ve finally found him. As I mentioned in my post, this trainer is a specialist who specifically trains working dogs. His day job is training K9s for local police stations, and in his private business he works with everything from the average house pet to PPD, search and rescue, and hunting dogs among other working types.

I strongly believe in board and trains and I know many people, from those with pets to those with mobility dogs, who have successfully used board and trains as part of their dogs’ training process.

I am fully aware of the methods my trainer uses, and his methods align with my training philosophy, including e-collar and prong collar training. I believe in balanced training, and while I use clicker training, shaping, that sort of thing, I do not agree with dogmatic positive-only trainers. So yeah, I’m not worried about my trainer sneakily using “aversive” training methods. He is only one man; this is not a multi-trainer company but rather a personal business.

I not only know people who have worked with this trainer but also had the good fortune to run into him while doing a PPD session with a client and his GSD. I am well versed in the characteristics of ethical PPD training and the telltale signs of bad PPD training that causes dogs anxiety/stress/fear.

My dog has a very strong foundation in everything I want proofed by the trainer. There is nothing I hope he accomplishes that is a new concept to him. I used to train him over 20 hours per week, and now I’m down to about 8-10 hours a week. I am aware that there is no use renovating a car to mint condition only to let it rust in the yard. And the trainer does work with clients before and after the board and train. I’m not just dropping him off and picking him up.

*The only anxiety that I am experiencing is that of knowing my dog will not be with me, because I will miss him, and he is an integral part of my daily life.*

Thanks for your concern."
431,"[Help] What would you do if you were dating someone great, but your dogs hated each other?",dogs,t3_a8awjj,8,False,False,a8awjj,"I’m posing this question as a hypothetical, but maybe some of you are/have been in this situation. Let’s say you’ve been seeing someone and are really hitting it off. You each have your own dog(s) at home, but when you try introducing your dogs to one another, they don’t get along at all. If things got more serious with this person, say to the point of wanting to move in together, what would you do? 

For the sake of clarity, I’ll say that this hypothetical occurred to me after I and a guy I’ve been seeing casually introduced our dogs to one another when he stayed over for a night, and we basically just quarantined each dog to one half of the house with an elaborate system of baby gates and closed doors! I have a 4lb F chihuahua and he has a 40lb F boxer, both dog aggressive— you see the issue. The prospect of moving in together or anything is so distant and improbable that it’s not worth actually worrying about, but since this is my first time dating since getting my dog the logistical issues are quite new and interesting to me.

I have a 10-year old Maltese male who’s always been pretty bad with the groomer...any groomer. He whines incessantly, he has urinated and defecated and he has been known to growl. However, over time, he’s become way better. I think partially because I had found a groomer he likes.

Well, we’ve had a reversion. The last two times he went to the groomer he acted a complete FOOL. He snapped at her, pissed everywhere, just a mess. She couldn’t even finish.

Is it normal for “senior” dogs to have this type of behavior regression? What can I do? He has to be groomed; even if I bath him regularly, I can’t cut his hair (it seriously looks like r/fuckmyshitup when I do lol).

435,[DISCUSSION] Kids in dog parks,dogs,t3_a87rwu,18,False,False,a87rwu,"A few weeks ago I was at the dog park and a family with kids came into the park.

436,"[Help] Holy unit of measurment, Batman.",dogs,t3_a89eg9,31,False,False,a89eg9,"Hi, guys! First post here! 

Yesterday, I brought home my first dog. I've fostered a lot of dogs in the past but this is my first time figuring out issues without a rescue backing me up. And boy howdy, she has some issues.

She's a 4 year old bulldog who is SEVERLY overweight, has next to zero social skills, and has lived up to this point in either a kennel or run. She has diarrhea, and was being fed probiotic pills like treats (they gave her 3 while I was talking to them). She was being kept outside and smelled so bad that I had to ride home with the windows cracked.

I've got an appointment set up with my vet for after Christmas. We stopped by the office to introduce her and make the appointment, and the main thing she was concerned with was her weight. She weighed in at around 67lbs.

So I need a little bit of advice.


How much should she be eating a day? Should I wean her down to a smaller amount slowly? She was being fed 2 cups of food, 3 times a day.


How fast should we increase our walks? She can almost make it around 1 city block before she starts getting tired right now.


My vet advised rice water and pumpkin for the upset tummy. How much of this should I offer her? How often? If this doesn't help, whats the next step until her appointment?


Do you have any tips for socializing her safely? Or anything else that I might find helpful?"
437,[Vent] My cousin bought a yellow lab and literally never walks it,dogs,t3_a7ybfw,117,False,False,a7ybfw,"Need to rant a bit about shitty pet owners.

So I've come home to see the fam for xmas and today my aunt tells me that my cousin (SC for shitty cousin) never walks her lab puppy, not even once a week. SC is always working/going to uni/interning and isn't home most of the time, so she says she doesn't have the time to walk the puppy. The poor pup was shut in a cage for the majority of the day until she outgrew it, now she gets to roam around my cousin's bedroom (which is the apartment's living room) and the covered concrete courtyard... so \~40m2 of space with no sunlight. ALL DAY. EVERYDAY.

SC bought the puppy on a whim, never trains her (although she said she's trained the puppy to not need walks?!) and has no plan to spay the puppy because of the cost. I think the puppy has been taken out in total about 5 times and she's now about 8 months old.

I've just been pissed about this for the pass few hours and thinking about what I should say to SC when I next see her. Welcome to suggestions

EDIT: SC lives at her own place with two flatmates, doggo is locked out in the courtyard these days when nobody is home so that's where she does her business. SC can definitely afford vet bills/a dog walker, but doesn't want to fork out it seems. My aunt isn't her mum, so there's only so much she can do/say, SC is going on another 3 week holiday in 2 months and my aunt's already offered to dog sit for free.  She and my uncle loves dogs so the doggo will at least have some free air and walks with them.

I would help her rehome doggo in a second, I'm just don't think SC would want to part with her because she's cute, quiet and doesn't make too much of a mess. There's only so much I can do because I live overseas for work and I hardly come home. The ideal scenario is that SC steps up, I'm just afraid that she'll agree to everything I say, promise to do better, do jackshit in reality and I'm a 9 hr flight away do anything about it. "
438,[Help] What breed - for second dog - is right for us?,dogs,t3_a8fvp7,2,False,False,a8fvp7,"1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Second dog. Wife grew up with dogs her whole life. I grew up around dogs but never had my own till we were married. Currently we have an Aussie Shepherd, one year old, male, neutered. 

 2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

No.

 3. Describe your ideal dog.

A big affectionate dog that's up for a long hike but able to relax and nap when we're done. My only complain with the current dog (Aussie Shepherd) is he doesn't EVER turn off. I'll run him 6 miles hard and he still wants non stop playtime all day. It can get a little frustrating. 

 4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Wife is interested in Golden and Labs, I like greater Swiss, Bernese mountain dog, saint Bernard, Irish wolfhound, Mastiff. Again, we'd like bigger, a little calmer, and affectionate. 


 5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Hiking above all. Long car rides - often times to more hiking. And must be a good family companion. 


Care Commitments

 1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We have opposite work schedules so the crate/alone time can be minimized. 

 2. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

We have a fenced in yard, access to dog parks, tons of great nearby dog friendly hikes and trails, and I currently get up early to run my dog before work. On days off I usually take him on an adventure. 


 3. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Yes yes and yes

Personal Preferences

 1. What size dog are you looking for?

Big. Like 90 pounds or more

 2. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and slobber we're not overly concerned with. The house is already full of dog hair and our current dog is a kisser. Barking we'd like to keep down if possible. 

 3. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

He/she needs to be okay at a dog park

Dog Personality and behavior

 1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly

 2. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I want a companion

 3. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

I'm okay with protective behavior, but not aggressive

 4. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I'll avoid it if at all possible

 5. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Aggression is my biggest concern. Regardless of gender we will get the dog fixed, but yeah. I Don't want an attack dog

Lifestyle

 1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Worst case scenario, 6 hours in a pen or gated off area. 

 2. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My wife and I are a team effort, 50/50

 3. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

Current one male fixed one year old aussie shepard. Possible more pets in future but no concrete plans now. 

 4. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Children within the next few years

 5. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Home owner

 6. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

US/ North East

 7. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

I had been searching for a dog like you for months, and got lucky when a rescue agency immediately replied to my request to see you. Most places wouldn't even respond to me, as I have a normal job, and would be a single dog parent. I'm assuming most didn't think that was ideal, but I was allowed to come see you anyway.

I got you when I had finished working on the movie The Incredibles 2, and took a few days off to go [meet you](https://imgur.com/NctPube), fall in love with you, and take you home. I remember being so nervous, I didn't have a crate to put you in, and I didn't have a harness to keep you still while I was driving, but [you just sat there, watching the world go by, completely happy and perfect.](https://imgur.com/jM81rbH) I had never taken care of anything else on my own. I've almost always been alone, and you fixed that.

You adjusted to my life so fast. You didn't bark, you learned how to use the doggy door in a matter of days, and you were so easy to take care of. You had walks every day, by me and a dog walker, and you barely pulled, but you slammed on the brakes all the time to stop and sniff everything. You had so many beds, [a bed in every room](https://imgur.com/Tl89iVZ). So many treats. I put my heart into you and you always just gave me as much love as you could. [You would fall asleep on me](https://imgur.com/pcLVSqu), and I'll never forget how I would let a big sigh out before going to sleep and you would always do the same. Just a deep breath before bed. Just like me.

There were some tough times, you had a bad case of [puppy warts](https://imgur.com/Yzk1zS0) that scared the hell out of me. You got over that, and then had urinary issues, which pills fixed, and then allergies, which pills fixed, but of all things I wish I had known the state of your kidneys.

We did so many things together, so much of my time and life over the past 10 months has been dedicated to you. I made you [puzzles and toys](https://imgur.com/xLJ3YWo). I learned how to dremel your nails and clip your toe hairs.

You always went wild [at the beach,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WYEeFiWUWg) and you loved all the other dogs. Never aggressive, but a little shy. I remember when we would go on hikes and you learned to [sit and wait for other dogs to come up to you, all on your own.](https://imgur.com/6MUac6M) You were perfect in so many ways and you learned tricks incredibly fast.

Heather took you to the beach last Tuesday while I was at work, and you [ran and ran for 3 hours straight.](https://imgur.com/KU9p08q) You probably had the time of your life. When we broke up, you seemed to slow down a little. You were less excitable, and I assumed it was because you missed Heather. But that night, after the beach, you woke me at 4am, yelping in my face. I pushed you away and couldn't figure out what was wrong, so you went to the vet the next day. They did xrays, and poked and prodded, and gave you pain killers. They assumed you strained yourself running around at the beach, and I believed you would get better with rest.

But then you started yelping and screaming whenever you had to get up. You trembled and shook. And I thought you were just being a wuss. I've had sore muscles, and you just suck it up! But it got harder and harder for you to get up off the ground. The vet saw you again and prescribed different pain killers. You had such a hard time this last week and I became so frustrated. I was so scared that I would have to deal with a dog that gets sick every 2 months. This last week I watched you slowly die and I was so selfish and scared. You wouldn't lay down because it was so hard to get up. You would just come by and stand next to me, and [put your head on me.](https://imgur.com/q4pSMSD)

446,[Help] Bigger dog constantly biting smaller one,dogs,t3_a8eewx,0,False,False,a8eewx,"Hi. I have two dogs, both very young  (oldest is about 20 months old). One is mixed  (Lab + unknown, probably) and the other one is a Dobberman. Neither are neutered.

Although he is younger, the Dobberman is considerably bigger and stronger and he seems to constantly leverage this power into one activity: biting the Lab. He closes his jaws around the Lab's neck and bites him into what I assume is submission. Sometimes there is humping involved too.

Almost every interaction I see between the dogs is pretty much defined by this. They playfight and then the Dobberman bites the Lab. I pet them and the Dobberman bites the Lab.
This behavior bothers me a lot because it seems to be negatively affecting the Lab. He often seems to not enjoy it and will try to run away or fight back, but will pretty much invariably end up being bitten. When I get out alone with him (to the vet, for example) he seems much more happy and lively than he does at home.
I have a strong suspicion the Dobberman is doing this out of jealousy, because he seems to try to keep the Lab away from me and my family and to ""punish"" him for being petted or given attention by biting him. I try to always be fair and distribute attention equally between them, but this is not enough for the Dobberman.

I am at loss about what to do (and whether something should be done) and would really like a little help.
Thanks in advance for your answers!"

I have a 2 years old female french bulldog, 27 pounds all muscle (no fat). She's super healthy, no problems whatsoever, fully active and runs like a crazy rabbit once she's loose at the park.

My dog has never shown any breathing problem and health problems in general and i'm surprised after knowing a lot of people have bad experience with this breed. After a tons of research they can get health problems and/or breathing complications as they get older.

Neither of us are first time pet-owners (we have cats, and have fostered dogs) and by all means our application doesn't seem to be the issue here. I don't know if it's just my luck, the rescue foundations near me, or the time of the year, but it seems that none of the rescue organizations care about responding back. I've been in touch with 3 organizations near me and 2 in other states and it takes days, sometimes weeks, to get any kind of information from them about a dog who I think might be a good fit and would like more information on. When they do end up responding it's usually a one-line unenthusiastic email about the questions I've asked with no interest in a follow-up, or the dog has already been adopted so I have to start the process all over again. Two shelters have said that they'll get back to me about another dog because they have my information and I've been through the application process and gotten approved, but then...nothing. Silence. I have to keep prodding to ask them to respond to my last email or phone call. I understand that people who work there are volunteers taking time out of their day to find the perfect home for these pups and are overwhlemed with all the responsibilities, but I'm getting so frustrated that I'm thinking of giving up.


I assumed working with a shelter or dog adoption agency would be easy but this process has been dragging on for way too long with what seems to be a one sided attempt at adoption. It seems I'm the only one who is excited and invested in giving a home to a dog. Is this normal and am I being a nuisance, or should I make more effort into getting in touch with the shelters/try my hand elsewhere? This is my first time adopting instead of fostering so I'm super confused why this is so incredibly different and difficult than fostering. Any advice would be really, really appreciated. Thank you!"
454,[Help] Does my aloof dog like paw massages?,dogs,t3_a8b1jm,2,False,False,a8b1jm,"She technically belongs to my parents. They adopted her as a puppy thinking she would be a small lab mix. Turns out she’s mixed with some Great Dane. She’s 8 years old, big, beautiful, and kind of aloof. Never been much of a cuddler or very affectionate unless she hasn’t seen you in a long time. Aside from that she doesn’t show a lot of love for her people. We love her just the same. 

In the last few years we have noticed she does something kind of odd. When we’re sitting down she’ll paw at us pretty persistently. Again, she’s big so you can’t exactly ignore it either. We give her pets but  that doesn’t seem to be what she wants. Food is in her bowl so that’s not an issue. The only thing that seems to stop her is holding her paw and kind of squeezing it a bit...like a hand massage for her paw. Obviously she will stop (because her paw is in our hand) but she genuinely seems to enjoy it. When we stop, she’ll paw at us even more aggressively.

She felt discomfort in one ear and had a few missing patches of fur, as well as a lot of redness around her face and her underbelly.
We didn’t think too much of it as we thought it was just from the gunk pulling on her fur before. However the next day we saw she had scratched her chest raw and had lots of dandruff-like bits all over her.
I was worried it was dermatitis or something like that so I immediately scheduled an appointment. They did blood tests and skin scrapes and when they came back, they said it was probably an allergic reaction to the bath they gave her and that I should just wash her again at home with a special shampoo they gave me.

I have a Maltese who's recently gone through Luxating patella surgery. She's about 3 weeks post op and tonight we noticed dark red marks appear on the inside of her leg, kinda like bruising. She's about 2.5 years and 4.5kg

She's been a nightmare to try and keep relaxed. She constantly wants to jump and run even in crate confinement. She's actually knocked over the pen we've been keeping her in while trying to escape. This was just 2 days after the cast came off

To be fair, she's calm for the majority of the time. For the most part she's just lying down relaxing. The problems come when the door bell or phone rings - she gets overly excited and jumps. 

Today, the doorbell rang and she jumped a few times. We picked her up to stop that and we noticed these marks appear on her leg. She has no (apparent) pain, she can still walk like she has been and it seems like nothing's wrong. 

She's going to the vet tomorrow (well, in 9 hours) but just for peace of mind, we're hoping it's just some bruising but we don't like that it happened right after jumping. 

Does anyone have experience with this surgery, and what could have happened to cause a bruise/internal bleeding like that? Keep in mind she seems absolutely normal like nothing's happened.

462,[Breeds] Need help choosing a breed,dogs,t3_a88wql,5,False,False,a88wql,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I've never owned a dog before, but I have some experience looking after them. I've done a lot of research though, and will do more once I've decided on the breed.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Either is fine. I just want it to be the right one for me.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Loyal, intelligent but not too stubborn, quick to learn and quick to obey once trained.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Vizsla has always been dear to me, but from what I've heard, they're only sold to homes that hunt.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Advanced obedience, some agility as a hobby. Running off-leash so we can go hiking together.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2 hours on average.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours. Dog park a few times a week, hikes and swimming whenever possible (summers are short here), agility once a week and long walks daily. I don't have a yard though.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'll do the nail clipping and such myself as needed, but I prefer dogs with shorter hair that only needs to be brushed maybe once a week and are easy to keep clean and stink free.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium. I prefer bigger dogs, but they're not always good for apartments.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I can handle, slobber is a no-no. I want a breed that either barks very little, or can be trained to not bark.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Doesn't matter that much.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Preferably not by barking. Can either be friendly or aloof, but not aggressive.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Preferably not. Will have to get along with my sister's smaller dog, as they'll be spending a lot of time together.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* High prey drive. I don't want the dog going after my cats, or any wild life when off leash.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* There's always someone in the house, or I'll take the dog with me.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* No preference, walking and playing with the dog occasionally.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have two cats.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, whenever I'm visiting my family. The kids are old and respectful enough to handle dogs with care, but obviously can be loud and energetic.

463,[Help] Anyone has experience with Pyometra surgery recovery?,dogs,t3_a889v5,3,False,False,a889v5,"My pitbull girl is 13 years old and she had an open pyometra surgery 5 days ago. I was extremely worried for her, but everything seemed to be just fine. The day after she was almost back to her normal self, eating, peeing, wagging her tail... I made sure she got plenty of rest and she never tried biting her stitches or anything.

Refuses to eat, lying down, without energy, shaking every now and then.

464,[Help] Family dog is aggressive towards me when other people are around,dogs,t3_a8bpnp,3,False,False,a8bpnp,"Sorry that this is so long, I didn’t want to exclude anything that might be helpful. The dog is almost 3 years old, spayed female border collie mix. We just had her to a new vet that we really liked three weeks ago for a full checkup including bloodwork, she’s perfectly healthy. We didn’t switch vets over this but the old vet brushed this behavior off basically saying ‘that’s how dogs are sometimes’. The new vet told me to try taking more of a primary caretaker role with her – being the one who feeds her, walks her, etc. I already did that for the most part but started doing it 100% of the time, telling my husband and daughter not to do anything for her and to come get me instead. That really isn’t making difference though.


She’s been doing this since we first got her when she was around 6 months old. She has gotten better, in the beginning it was a lot more frequent, 4-5 times a day. Now she only gets aggressive maybe a few times a week. She’ll start barking at me, charging at me, and then biting me. She doesn’t bite with full force, but hard enough to leave bruises and sometimes break the skin. Sometimes it’s for no reason at all, I might have just walked past her. Other times there’s a clear reason like if I take something from her or tell her no if she’s chewing something *but* I can do these things 9 out of 10 times with no problem, 10/10 times when we’re alone.


The things I’ve tried:

- The first thing I tried was firmly saying no and offering a variety of toys to bite instead. She has zero interest in any of the toys when she gets like this, nothing distracts her. 
- My husband doesn’t like crates since he has seen his dad and sister abuse crate training. So for the first 6 months I’d consistently put her in the spare bedroom for a 15 minute time out. This did not help at all. Of course she’d be fine when I let her out, but she would do it again two hours later like the punishment never happened. 
- Then I tried picking her up and sitting down while holding her on my lap until she calmed down, repeating no and stop the entire time. She would usually settle down in 5 minutes or less this way. But would do it again the next time the mood struck her. None of these “time outs” seem to condition her at all, it’s just a temporary fix in the moment it’s happening. 
- I thought maybe it’s a dominance thing, maybe she wants to tell me that when others are around she and them are above me in her hierarchy. So I’d stand up, not back away from her, and firmly repeat No! Stop! She knows these words and obeys them any other time. With this she normally continues for a minute or two until she sees it isn’t going anywhere then slowly winds down, ending up hiding behind someone while growling/grumbling at me.
- I’ve tried ignoring it. If I walk away she chases me and bites. If I sit down and do something else she’ll charge and pounce at me, biting progressively harder until she gets a reaction and then resumes the barking/charging tantrum until she tires of it like described above.


I spend the most time with her since I work from home except for 10-12 hours a week. One of my first thoughts was that being part border collie she just needs more exercise and mental stimulation. For the past two years I’ve taken her jogging with me almost every day, she has a very large fenced yard to run in any time she wants, she has two other animals to play with, we take her out to play fetch or football, she goes with us anytime anyone is running an errand so she’s out seeing new things, we are pretty outdoorsy and she is with us anytime we’re hiking, camping, fishing, whatever. She has puzzle toys, all kinds of regular toys, we teach her tricks to keep her mind busy, she’s very smart and learns quickly. This is her normal life, it’s not boring. And she’s usually pretty happy and otherwise mostly well behaved. 


When I’m the only person home she is perfect. It’s when anyone else is around that she acts out. It would make sense if it were just certain people, but it’s everyone that she knows – my husband, our daughter, friends and family who visit, anyone she’s familiar with. Everyone has tried to discourage the behavior but it makes no difference. No one is doing anything to positively reinforce this – no pets, no attention, no “oh it’s ok”, nothing. Sometimes she’ll stop if my husband tells her no, but sometimes not. We live in the middle of nowhere, the closest trainer is a 2.5 hour drive each way, that’s not feasible. And from the facebook page I saw (they didn’t have a real website), it doesn’t look like they’re even a professional. They had no certifications or mentions of their training. 


I have never hurt this dog in any way at all, no one in my family has. We love animals. We don’t know exactly what the first 6 months of her life were like since we got her from a shelter, all they said was that a nice older couple dropped her off because they couldn’t handle her. I didn’t see that as a red flag, a lot of times older people can’t handle puppies, especially energetic breeds. And she obviously passed the shelter’s behavior tests so she must not have been doing this with them. I don’t know if there’s something about me that reminds her of something she doesn’t like or what. I’ve heard that border collies will “herd” people but from what I understand of it I don’t think that’s what she’s doing. If I’m doing something to trigger this I don’t know what it is because I treat her the same way as I do when we’re alone and she’s fine then. I thought she’d eventually calm down, I thought with everything we do as far as keeping her busy and happy combined with getting older she’d eventually get better. And she has a little, but I’m starting to think she’ll never completely stop. She just terrorizes me. Only me. And only when other people are present. "

I kind of like it when he has these super hard poops as I think it's definitely helping express the anal glands.

My question to you is if rock hard poops are okay, do you follow the BARF guidelines religiously, and any other general comments and suggestions are welcome."
469,[Help] Tips on walking two dogs together,dogs,t3_a89fu8,6,False,False,a89fu8,"Hi,

We have two medium-size dogs, a five-year-old male Brittany spaniel/blue heeler mix and a female three-year-old pointer mix. I've done a lot of work with them individually on loose leash walking. And, one-on-one, they are pretty good. But it is hard to walk them together. One will see something and want to stop or mark or see another dog/person and want to interact. They also get a little competitive with who is in front of the other dog, and they react to other people/dogs/animals on the walk differently than if they were alone.

They are not small dogs, so it requires a lot of energy to keep them in check on a walk together. Any advice? I have been taking turns walking one in the morning and the other in the evening and swapping who goes when, but it takes a lot of time. And, always, always, the dog who is left home is upset. My husband can walk them both together, but he is able to keep them at a moderate jog -which minimizes chance for distraction--the whole time. I am not as fit.:-( Are there strategies for walking multiple dogs that are different from walking a single dog by your side?

470,[Help] My dog has been having paw problems for over a year,dogs,t3_a8b28h,4,False,False,a8b28h,"My Febe is a Maltese, and she’ll be 11 in February. For the past year and a half she has developed a nasty habit of licking and sometimes gnawing at her paws. It’s not even a specific paw; she alternates between the four. Because of this, the fur on her paws start to thin and her skin gets dry, flaky, and generally inflamed. Sometimes she even chews them to the point of bleeding.
We’ve tried many things. This includes numerous visits to various vets, and for the most part they just brush it off as allergies, but it’s rare that they actually attempt to fix it. One vet gave us medicine to give to her daily, and it seemed to work for about a week before she started at it again.
We purchased lil booties for Febe to wear to prevent her from chewing, but they’re a little loose (she has tiny feets) so they always manage to slip off. 
My dad read somewhere online that it helps to give her a little spoon of coconut oil every day, and we’ve been doing that for about a week, but still no change. We’re also concerned about the coconut oil because you know how those home remedies can be. I don’t wanna make her sick.
I love my Febe more than anything in the world. I completely adore her and I’m worried! I don’t want her to be in pain. She just won’t stop chewing her paws. 
Has anyone else’s dog had anything similar? If so, how did you fix it? I’m very open to suggestions. Thanks!"

What should I have done?",dogs,t3_a88xao,10,False,False,a88xao," I was just walking my dog minding my own buisness when an older man came up to me and screamed in my face to ""pick up this damn dog shit."" Thing is, my dog pooped about 20 minutes earlier and I definitly picked it up, as I ALWAYS do. There's no way she took a poop where he claimed she did as my eyes are always glued on her and she takes foreeeever to find a good position to poop, so I would've definitly noticed. She didn't even pee, so I have no fucking idea how he thought she took a shit.   


I tried to reason with him like ""Oh sorry, you must be mistaken, my dog didn't poop, I would've picked it up. Sorry for the misunderstanding."" But he continued to scream in my face saying that he watched me and to pick up her damn shit. I said to him if he was so sure to please show me where it was and I'd gladly pick it up but he just continued to scream at me. I was seriously scared. What the hell should I pick up if she didn't poop????    


He went on about how he wants to kill all dogs and their owners and how disgusting we all are. I slowly took off in the other direction being scared shitless and not wanting to be screamed at any longer for something I didn't even do. What should I have done in a situation like this? What would you have done? Do I need to be afraid of the safety of my dog? Should I look for another route to walk from now on?"

Maybe it's because I'm just now getting off antidepressants and can feel things much more strongly, but I can't stop crying. He was my best friend, and often only friend, for such a long time.

Sometimes I think I'll never love anyone or anything like him.

Tears are literally pouring down my face right now. I just don't know how to get past this. He was such a good boy and I miss him so much and want to see him every single day and it never gets any better.

I know it's something I have to work on though, my boyfriend has been very sweet and supportive for the past year-and-a-half. He even helped me bury him. But I understand he expects me to stop crying about it, and I should. I just don't know how.

474,[Help] Anyone have experience with tooth root abscesses?,dogs,t3_a87spk,4,False,False,a87spk,"Hi everyone, my 12 year old Chihuahua/Pom mix has had swelling under his eyes on and off for over a year now. His cheek would swell a little bit and then burst into a little pus mess. The first time it happened we figured it was just a bite from something? So we cleaned it up and it seemed to go back to normal. But now it seems his cheeks are always pus-y. 

So I looked it up and I believe it might be because his teeth are infected. I found that infected teeth can push against the dog's cheeks and cause the swelling followed by eventual burst with pus coming out. 

I'm pretty sure that is what my dog is suffering from but I'm not positive.  To be honest, it doesn't seem to bother him at all. He doesn't show signs of discomfort. We can pet his cheeks and head and he won't pull away. He still eats food normally. But it is pretty gross and I feel bad for him. 

I can't seem to find a price anywhere online for how much treatment is. I am going to bring him to the vet as soon as I get paid. Does anyone have experience with tooth root abscesses with dogs and can share some insight? Also, I'm not even sure if thats for certain what we're dealing with. Any insight is appreciated!"

I was so proud of how my newest pup’s training was going, and at 10 months felt he had exceptional recall.

I was mistaken.

After only 20 minutes out he found a huge soft pile of poop and started rolling! He was a bit ahead of me and the path was icy, so I called him back. He looked right at me, then back down at the poop, and calculated exactly how long he had until I reached him! He got a few more rolls in before I caught up to him. He was a disgusting mess!

At least we got to cross another training milestone when he got his first ever bath when we got home...

Looks like we’ve got more work ahead. I’m a little hurt that a pile of poo was more valuable than me 😪"
478,"[HELP] Please recommend me a healthy dog food brand. I recently learned that a) my dog has an enlarged heart, and b) the potential connection between diet and heart disease",dogs,t3_a84orb,55,False,False,a84orb,"Edit: breed is a shih-tzu.


We are currently feeding our dogs Orijen (by Champion Petfoods) senior dog food which they have been eating since 2015 or possibly earlier.


In regards to heart disease... In 2017 the vet mentioned that my dog had a low-grade heart murmur. Fast forward to last month. She started coughing a bit and when we took her to the vet, we learned that she has a grade 3 heart murmur now and the radiograph shows an enlarged heart. She is currently on some heart medication. I believe one of the medications caused loss of appetite and heavy breathing but did resolve the coughing (Furosemide). She is on Vetmedin now and has regained her appetite and breathing normally!


As for diet... I recently learned two things:

1) The current FDA investigation about the potential connection between DCM and diet containing peas, lentils, other legume seeds, or potatoes

2) Orijen, which I always thought was a high-quality locally-made dog food (I'm from Canada), changed their formula and moved their plant to the US in early 2016 or late 2015. Based on some posts in this subreddit, apparently the new formula uses less meat and more peas/lentils/legumes for protein which I have noticed in the ingredients list.


I am not saying there is a connection between Orijen (by Champion Petfoods) and my dog's enlarged heart but I want to be safe than sorry and avoid those ingredients. (Though I have found some news articles about this brand and heart disease, i.e. https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/investigations/-we-were-in-tears-heart-disease-toxins-among-growing-fears-in-boutique-dog-foods)


Please recommend me a good dog food brand! I have been reading as much as possible on dog nutrition and there is so much misinformation out there still. However, I have learned some things like grains aren't bad for dogs, sites like dogfoodadvisor are misleading, and homemade dog food may lack a lot of nutrition which is why I want to stick with store-bought dry dog food.

479,[Help] My dog bit my Girlfriend. Unsure about what to do.,dogs,t3_a86r8n,4,False,False,a86r8n,"Two days ago our dog Frank bit my GF when she called him away from his bone to pet him. She told me she was giving him some scratches when he randomly freaked out and bit her on the face. **She has since been to the ER and everything is fine.** Frank is a 2 year old Male Flat coated retriever. We got him from the pound 4 months ago, besides all this he's a very smart and intelligent dog. He knew the standard sit, stay , don’t piss in the house when we got him. He was very sweet and non aggressive but since we got him he has shown signs of protectiveness. A little with me and a lot with my GF. 

This is not the first time Frank has bitten before. **He bit me on the face** for laying down on his tail (by accident) and **bitten one of our close friends**. In that instance our friend had entered the door, Frank had given them the sniff test and was walking around just doing dog stuff and our friend felt un-easy, they turned away from frank then he bit them on the leg. 

Before he bit my girlfriend and I, we started taking him to dog training classes and even got a personal behavioral trainer, he was doing great. 

Once my GF parents find out about the bite they will demand that we either **give the dog away or kill him.** 

He’s generally a great dog besides all of the biting. My girl and I are unsure of what to do. Is there any hope of getting him to stop this shit or do we have to bite the bullet and give him away. 

**TLDR: Our dog that we have had for 4 months keeps fucking biting us and our friends, we don't know what to do, but we still love the dog.**"

He’s very anxious in general as he has undergone multiple surgeries as a puppy to ensure a healthier life as he grew up. 

My dog’s name is DJ. Every time I pick up the leash and collar, he goes NUTS (in a good way)! His tail wags uncontrollably, he runs to the door, and bursts to the sidewalk when I open it for him. 

He does what every normal dog does on our walks: He looks around, he sniffs the trees and what-not, he focuses his attention on nearby dogs. But for some reason, his tail usually doesn’t wag while we walk. I know he loves to walk because of his reaction before and after. But it seems like he’s just a little nervous while me and him walk. His tail isn’t COMPLETELY in between his legs, but his tail is typically down and somewhat hunched inward (sometimes - not always). It could be because he’s an anxious dog in general - He doesn’t like aggressive behavior from other dogs and he’s extremely gentle.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience about this. He’s an amazing dog - my best friend! It’s just weird. Why would he love walking, yet act anxious on the walks? This isn’t a serious concern as he’s been like this for as long as I’ve known him, but I’m new to reddit and wanted to see if anyone wants to talk about it. Thank you!"

I was trying to just call him to me with treats and make him sit in his kennel or come to me on the couch, but that has stopped working and he is barking with a lot more intensity than before. He no longer barks every single time someone comes in, but the times he does he is really barking, sometimes growling also. 

Honestly I think part of the problem is the people in my building seem to have a lot of short term ""guests"" who just come in the main door, go to their unit, knock and then leave again within 5-10 minutes. Some times they'll have people coming in and out like that for a couple hours. This also means that hes barking when they first come in the building, when they knock and then when they leave again and it is pretty disruptive. 

My neighbors have already complained to the landlord about the barking and I feel lost for what to do since a lot of the advice I see is to ignore it or call him to me but that's not working anymore. I'd really appreciate any other thoughts or advice.

She has grown extremely attached to me to the point where I personally don't believe it is healthy.  She cries if I just go upstairs, she cries at night because she wants to sleep in my bed with me, she cries when I leave as well. When I am holding her she growls at my dad when he comes near.
She reacts very inwards towards others and becomes very stiff and alert.  She does not care to socialize at all with other dogs either. She also does not really know how to play. She just wants to be with me 24/7. It's one thing for her to be a lap dog but is it normal for a dog to be this obsessive? What can I do to help with her severe seperation anxiety? This issue has really put strains on my daily schedules as well as my sleep.
Many people say to just wait until I take her back home but she is not as happy when she is not with me and I want her to be able to live a happy life with my grandmother.  She does love my grandmother more than others but she is obsessed with me.

I need a short, interesting, easy-to-say, name for a female fox red colored Lab puppy. One that sounds nice with our our existing dog named Flare (like the jeans, hehe). The puppy is a goofball and she’s very snuggly. Could potentially be a handful. She’s a VERY thick/big-boned pup. 

We like skiing, nature, and western inspired names, but open to any funny/short names. Currently thinking “bells” because it goes well with “flare” but the husband isn’t sold on that one. 

Thanks in advance :)

Warning those images are quite ""graphic"" they're what my bloodstained clothes and leg looked like after running barefoot so fast for so long, I held out a shred of hope when I got there but it wasn't enough, she passed and I had to bury her in a shallow grave, It was a very hard thing to do since I had a ton of fantasies of freezing her once she gets old or perserving her brain but that was taken away from me in a second, Hug your dogs tight please, and I just want to know people will never forget my dog the only thing I love in this life my terrier pinscher, Another womans dog was attacked but fortunately it survived, she took a pic of me to use against the man who owns the 2 rotwillers that attacked both our dogs, I'm not sure how this story falls into the rules but I had to put it out here, I love her so much and she is still with me, forever.

I Just don't want to forget and I still can't digest it, I still want to pass out."
501,[DISCUSSION] My dog keeps urinating on the floor.,dogs,t3_a86hoq,6,False,False,a86hoq,"My dog Cassie (half Golden Retriever, half Border Collie) is a bit older than three months but not four months old yet. She seems (fingers crossed) to be fully housebroken for poop.

However, she will still pee on the floor. No signals or anything, she just squats and goes. It's completely healthy-looking urine, no blood or cloudiness or anything, and she doesn't seem to be in pain so I doubt it's a U.T.I. I also doubt she's incontinent because she doesn't pee in her sleep.

I don't think it's psychological either. She doesn't really seem nervous when she urinates on the floor and while she sometimes does it while excited, I doubt being excited is a necessary condition because she pees on the floor plenty of times when not excited. There is no apparent pattern, it's just random; she seems to be past the ""peeing thirty seconds after drinking"" stage, too.

So why do you think she urinates on the floor and how do we stop it (we're already taking her out heaps of times)?"

In the last few years she has gone deaf, has many benign cysts, and has bad arthritis.

I think he could go to hospitals and cheer people up, or a nursing home, or sit in a library with kids reading to him. I’d like others to be able to enjoy him. How do I make this happen?

507,How do I get my dog to stop barking. [Help],dogs,t3_a82xmi,3,False,False,a82xmi,"Hello, this is my first time posting on this sub, so if this should instead be moved to another subreddit, lmk. Also very long so tl;dr at the bottom. 

So in our family, we have had 3 small dogs at different times. Our oldest, a Yorkie terrier, has been with us for 12 years and is extremely sweet. Around 5 years ago, we got 2 other dogs, both Pekingese. We gave 1 to a family member, and kept the other as a gift for our kids. The Yorkie has always been extremely friendly, and didn’t mind the new member, while the Pekingese has always been very docile, so was fine living with the Yorkie. After being with us for 4 years, someone broke into our backyard and took our Pekingese while my family slept. Our Yorkie has always been very fast and agile, so he wasn’t taken, but the Pekingese, being very docile, was probably taken without much resistance. 

Fast forward to the next day, our kids were heartbroken, because their dog was gone, and were very distraught. Both dogs were chipped, but after several weeks of making signs and calling local shelters to no avail, we gave up. Very quickly we decided to get another dog, and we adopted from a friend a Pomeranian. 

This Pomeranian was a puppy, only around 6 weeks old, and was never very aggressive towards our Yorkie, as our Yorkie wasn’t aggressive towards it. While raising it, I was the primary caregiver; bathing, feeding, and taking this dog for walks. While on walks, he was never aggressive towards dogs we encountered, simple looking at it and continuing walking. 

During the next few months, we’ve had several parties, and during some parties we had a recurring guest who liked to bring her dog as well. Whenever that dog was near our Pomeranian, our Pomeranian would bark NON-STOP. Never getting near it, but continuously barking at it from a few feet away. That other dog is was very friendly as well, not barking back or going near it, but our dogs constant barking was annoying, so we simply separated them and that was it. This happened a couple times afterwards, but we did the same thing. 

Now, fast forward a couple more months, approximately 6 months since our dog was stolen, to this week, and we get a call from the next town over, saying they have our dog. We rush over the next day, and our Pekingese is there, a little fatter then he left us, but it was him. Our kids were ecstatic about this news, as was I. On the drive home, in the back of my mind, I had the thought of how the Pomeranian was going to handle the new dog, and became a bit worried.

Upon coming home, the Pekingese was very happy, wagging its tail and running around, obviously overjoyed to be back home. I was the only one home, so I brought him to the backyard where the other dogs were, and let the inside. I held the Pekingese in my lap and sat down. Letting the other dogs smell him. The Yorkie remembered him, and reacted happy and went about his day. But the Pomeranian smelled him for about 5 seconds, and began barking loudly. 

The Pekingese smelled him and looked at him, but aside from that, more or less ignored the Pomeranian. I had work to do at my desk here at home, so I left them inside and began to work. For the rest of the day, the Pomeranian would NOT STOP BARKING. It would bark for and hour, take a 5 minute break doing something, then look at the other dog, the begin barking again. I got tired of it and put the Pomeranian outside and let the Yorkie and Pekingese stay inside. At night, I put them all outside, fed them in separate bowls, and stayed outside to make sure nothing happened. They all ate their food, but after the Pomeranian finished eating, he began his barking again. They sleep inside, so I had to have them sleep in different rooms for the night, because the Pomeranian wouldn’t stop growling and barking. This proceeded for the next 2 days, with me trying different things I read online, like taking them for walks together and just trying to let them get used to each others smells, but to no avail.

During this, the Pomeranian wouldn’t do anything but bark, while the Pekingese wouldn’t do anything to retaliate. Finally, the Pomeranian started to nip  at the Pekingese’s legs or face, and the Pekingese started to bite and bark back. This has been happening for the last day or so. So my request for you guys is if there is any other ways that we may get the Pomeranian to stop being aggressive towards the Pekingese, or at least to stop barking, because I am getting very close to just buying a muzzle. I can’t stay home all day and keep them separated, nor can I leave them alone in the backyard in fear of them hurting one another. 

tl;dr One of our dogs was stolen and we got another dog to replace him. After 6 months, our old dog showed up, but the replacement dog is extremely aggressive towards the old dog and won’t stop barking and fighting. What do I do?

I have an 8 month old puppy who is in a stage in training where he tests every boundary he has been taught. I know this, and am aware of it.

And I don’t want him to be scared of me; I love him with all my heart. And most importantly I want him to actually learn, and I know getting frustrated or angry isn’t how he is going to learn.

511,[Breeds] Which dog is right for me?,dogs,t3_a85rev,2,False,False,a85rev,"Hey Reddit - My girlfriend and I will be looking to add a dog to our lives and we wanted your opinions on different breeds. We have been talking with a couple breeders (various breeds) but before we got too far into the relationship with a certain breeder, I wanted to post here and see what you all thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Introduction\*\*  
1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\* No. I grew up with a weimaraner and have trained a standard poodle. My girlfriend grew up with 3 small to medium mutts.   
2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
\* Preferably breeder but open to a young rescue.  
3) Describe your ideal dog.  
\* We would like a dog that can keep up with us on weekend hikes, and one that is also a good running companion for myself (triathlete). We would also like a dog that has an “off switch” when it is time to relax. A dog who is historically loving/sociable/friendly to its owners and with others as well.  
4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* We are looking at GSPs, Weim’s, Dalmatians, Aussies, Rhodesian Ridgebacks. (I know all of these dogs besides the sporting ones have much different temperaments and needs, but just giving you all a wide scope of what we have looked at)

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\* Besides the basic commands: Off leash, running on a leash with me (canicross type stuff). Potential dog sports  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\* We have 30min-1hr in the morning. Flexible schedules between the two of us to stop by at lunch most days. After 5pm is puppy time.  
7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
\* On average we can spend 1.5 to 2 hours a day exercising. When the pup is old enough he or she will also be my running companion (up to 30mpw). Can also bike the dog. We live close to a dog park and can go there 3-4 times a week. Hiking on the weekends.   
8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\* I am open to doing some but would rather not have to deal with it too much.   
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
9) What size dog are you looking for?  
\* 45-75lbs  
10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\* Shedding: Alot is okay, not a dealbreaker. Barking: If someone breaks in I want the dog to bark, other than that stay relatively quiet. Slobber: Minimal.   
11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\* Very  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\* Snuggly  
13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  
\* Eager to please  
14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
\* I would like them to bark if someone enters my apartment without myself or my girlfriend present. Would like to have a dog that is still approachable by visitors.   
15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\* No. I want a dog that is very playful with other dogs.   
16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  
\* None that I can think of at the moment.  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?   
\* Usually in 4 hour increments twice a day on weekdays. Weekends would rarely be alone.   
18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
\* My girlfriend prefers a large snuggly dog. Wants to feel comfortable walking with the dog at night. The involvement will be just about 50/50 except most of the exercise will come from me. Olive (our 1 year old kitten) would love a play partner and snuggle buddy as well.   
19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
\* 1 cat  
20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\* Not really.   
21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

512,[Discussion] What do you do when someone says they want a designer dog?,dogs,t3_a7znr0,169,False,False,a7znr0,"My future brother-in-law recently moved into a small townhome with his other brother. He's a major dog lover, so we've been talking to him a lot about our soon-to-be-puppy (picking up our golden retriever in 3 weeks!). He mentioned he hopes to get a dog in the spring, and that he's looking to get a mini goldendoodle or mini australian labradoodle because of the size and no shedding. 

What do you say in these instances? Do you just let people be ignorant and support BYB? Do you call them out on it and try to tell them why they shouldn't? The situation is a bit tricky because their family dog is a goldendoodle and they love her, so having to tell them that they shouldn't support designer dogs would probably be seen as an attack on their current beloved dog.

So I have my beautyful baby Maxxie. His dad is a Rottweiler, and his mom a blue Pittbull.
Maxxie is 3, almost 4 years old. We recieved him as a gift from his parents owner. We didn't plan to have a dog, but soon the little one stole our hearts.
He grew up healthy and happy. The vet checked him up for vaccines and stuff. 
He was pretty normal untill about 20 month ago slowly some weird sores appered in his paws. The vet told us that it was due to walking on heat surfaces, but we only walked him at nigh.  Anyways, the walks were suspended. He recovered with some antibacterial spray the vet gave us. 
He took month but he was healthy again. Then about 14 months ago he developed some weird bald patches in his back. The patches soon became small sores covered in what I though it was fat or oil. Another trip to the vet reveled it was some infection. He gave us some antibiotic and then steroids. That only worked for a while. Then the vet suggested too much fat on Maxxies diet. So we switched onto another brand of dog food. That didn't work.
Antibiotic soap baths? Done. 
So we tried a second opinion. Was Maxxie allergic to pollen? Leaves? Fabric softener? Even tap water?  We stopped the walking again, washed all his clothes, only feed him bottled water and specific food. Nothing.
Im so sad right now. Seeing my poor baby like this. The sores started bleeding. He bites himself and make it worst. 
Third vet opinion: maybe he has fleas. No he doesn't but anyways we bought some liquid to prevent fleas. 
I don't know what else to do. Please, please help.
I would like to post some pictures but it might be too graphic. "

Background: I moved over the weekend and I’m crashing in my parents’ basement for the next few weeks until my new lease starts. I also started a new job on Monday so my dogs have to stay at home all day. At my last job, they came to work with me and sat under my desk all day every day, I could take them out as much as they wanted and they could play with the other office dogs all day. So naturally they are a little freaked out about all of the sudden changes happening all at once, moving out of their house, in a new place without their mom 40+ hours a week.

Any tips on getting them to stop having potty accidents in my parents’ basement? I have a potty pad out and they blatantly ignore it, popping a squat on the carpet a few feet away from it. 

Also wondering if maybe my girl dog has a UTI? She is peeing two huge pees in the middle of the night when she normally would go all night without having to go to the bathroom. When I take her on walks she stops every 10 feet to pee and nothing comes out (obviously after she emptied her bladder first time she popped a squat). Help!

Potty schedule: 

7am our for a quick pee
7:30-8 long walk for pee/poo
Noon: my dad take them on a walk
Late afternoon: my dad lets them out in the backyard to go pee

525,[Breeds] - Please recommend a breed for me,dogs,t3_a7zd22,18,False,False,a7zd22,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I owned a shepherd mix rescue for roughly 12 years.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescue

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

 My ideal dog would possess the following traits:

* Relatively small and quiet breed (I live alone in a 2 bedroom apartment)

- Calm demeanor, somewhat lower-medium energy level. I don't have the right type of space for a hyper dog, but I'd still like a dog that will have enough energy to go out on hikes if possible.
- Will travel well, as I spend a lot of time traveling back and forth to my GF's place
- Low prey drive (GF has two cats)
 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I don't really have too much of a preference, but I've never liked beagles, schnauzers, or other curly-haired dogs. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands, and to stay with me off-leash.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I mostly work from home, so I have a lot of time to interact with the dog

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Same as above, I am home almost every day, and have a dog park on-site, and can generally spend as much time exercising the dog each day as it needs. I do live in the northeast, so heavy snow can affect my ability to provide exercise for short periods of time. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'd likely pay a professional to do this, so a dog that requires less grooming is preferred.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Something less than 50lbs

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I can tolerate, but the less barking the better (apartment), and not a big fan of slobbering dogs.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Fairly important. There is a dog park at my apartment, and I'd like for the dog to be able to interact off-leash. I also do a lot of hiking, and would definitely enjoy having the ability to have the dog off-leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in the middle. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Somewhere in the middle

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I'm fine with a dog barking at a door knock, but I would like a dog that will warm up to visitors quickly

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. The rules of my apartment do not allow any dogs that are aggressive.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I think I've covered them

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not often at all, since most of my work is done from home. Occasionally, I go into work, maybe 2-3 times a week, and am gone for 3-4 hours at a time.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone, but when visiting my girlfriend she only requires that the dog doesn't eat her cats.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* I don't have kids, so no. If I brought the dog to work, it would interact with kids often, but that's not a requirement.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent currently. The restricted breeds are: Pitbull, American Staffordshire Terrier, Rottweiler, Doberman, Akita, Chow, Mastiff, Great Dane, German Shepherd, Bull Terrier, Husky, Dalmatian or Alaskan Malamute or any mix of these breeds.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live near Worcester, MA. Massachusetts itself does not impose any ban on certain breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* The average high temp in January is 30°, the average high temp in July is 80°

I think that covers pretty much everything. Thanks, everyone."
526,[Help] Food changes after life changes?,dogs,t3_a82fdd,1,False,False,a82fdd,"I have a 7 year old female Beagle. She's always been a chow hound - will take as much food as you'll give. Because of this, I've broken her feedings between two meals a day.

I give her half a cup (not an actual Cup, just the cup I use to draw food from the bag) in the morning before I leave, and half a cup in the afternoon when I get home.

She's always devoured her food as soon as I've set it down.

Until last week. Last Thursday I took in a coworker who was about to be homeless and I'm letting him crash on my reading/coffee room's couch for a while. I try to keep her out of that room because she's been known to pull some books and decoratives off of low shelves, and I have some expensive editions, collectables, and such in there, alongside my (religious) altar.

So when my guest is staying in that room, we keep the door closed. She's spent some time around him, however, and they've become quick friends, she lets him pet her and is generally welcoming of him in 'her domain'. But she has seemed a little more alert, and she's spent a good deal of time watching that closed door.

However, she's been eating much less since he came. When I feed her in the morning, I've been coming back to an untouched or half-eaten bowl, and she'll eat the rest later on, without prompting me for more, like she sometimes does by pawing the bowl- which she normally does when I get home and don't feed her immediately.

Any ideas? Thanks!"
527,[help] Allergic to new puppy? But I already own one dog? Something else?,dogs,t3_a829t6,22,False,False,a829t6,"I'm lowkey crying (not just the potential allergies). Two days ago my family and I got our Alaskan malamute boy Luka. We already have a Rottweiler named Rita.

Long story short I was inpatient for a week and when I got home I also got runny nose, watery eyes and my asthma appered too. I thought it was just because my parents were cleaning and maybe the dust got in my system.  Next day Luka comes home and I still have the symptoms. We suspect the Christmas hyacinths so we place them in a room where I rarely go to. Still got the symptoms. The o.ly change is Luka. 

Can other breeds cause allergic reactions? I never got any from Rita. I'm devastated at the thought of rehoming him. It's only been couple of days but he's been doing so good and Rita and him get along so great."
528,[help] am I doing enough for my dog?,dogs,t3_a826om,4,False,False,a826om,"I adopted my first dog last summer. She’s a 4 year old pit mix and I love her so much. My boyfriend and I have to work/go to school during the day, so she gets left home alone with the cat for about 8-9 hours a day. She gets two 20-30 minute walks morning and night, and we also play with her when we get home. I also take her to doggy classes when we can afford it. I worry about leaving her home alone all day, though. I’m glad she has the cat to play with(they love each other and the cat has plenty of places to hide from her), but I worry I’m not exercising/playing with her enough. Thoughts? "
529,[help] mostly housetrained dog suddenly having repeated accidents,dogs,t3_a80cpt,4,False,False,a80cpt,"My dog comes to work with me (a retail shop).  Yesterday she had 3 accidents.  She had been accident free for at least a couple of weeks.  I panicked and took her to the  vet but the urinalysis checked out fine.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that has changed this week is that I had a trainer come on Tuesday morning and he taught me clicker training.  I've been doing a lot of that especially with the door opening (click as door opens, treat).  Tuesday she got a ton of treats during the session (she's only 6 lbs) so I changed over to using part of her morning kibble.  I didn't notice that she was drinking more water.  

&amp;#x200B;

Today she's already had another accident, which I just spotted, so I don't know when/in what circumstance it happened.   She had already been out twice this morning (7am and 9:30am before leaving for work) and it's only 12:30p now).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking it's either excited peeing or submissive peeing?  Should I just go back to square one with potty training?

530,[Help] Rough first fostering experience. Am I asking too much?,dogs,t3_a7z7aj,9,False,False,a7z7aj,"This is a little long, so TLDR: My SO and I are finishing up fostering a dog for the first time, and it's been a nightmare. Are we being crazy and expecting too much from the foster organization?

SO: My partner and I have been wanting a dog for ages, and we finally moved into a place with a nice backyard and a reasonable pet deposit. We were a little nervous about going full commitment to a dog, so when an opportunity came up to foster a ~1 year old beagle mix it seemed like a great idea.

From the start, though, it has just been an incredibly stressful and un-fun experience. We work opposite schedules generally, and there are only 2-3 days a week where the dog would need to be crated for at most 8 hours (we are sometimes able to come back for a walk at lunch, but not always). We were told by the rescue that the dog's previous foster worked similar hours so it would not be an issue. From the start, however, whenever we left her alone she would be obviously stressed out and break out of her crate. The rescue gave us some info on crate training but after a few weeks of that there was no improvement and the dog was getting even more stressed out. It is also worth noting that the dog only had these problems when we left, otherwise she was perfectly content to sleep in her crate and went in voluntarily very often. She howls incessantly during the day, according to our neighbor. When the rescue got us a gate and suggested we try gating her in a room, she tore down the sturdy gate. She has scratched the hell out of exit doors in our house (the front/back doors she sees us walk out of).

Some of the chaos she's caused when alone is just inexperience. Every time we come home and find something chewed up, it's a new lesson in puppy-proofing the house, and that's fine and to be expected. But the rescue kept blowing off the clear symptoms (not necessarily officially diagnosable behavior) of separation anxiety. We understand that many rescue dogs go through a decompression phase and that the amount of time can vary drastically, but this dog is incredibly stressed out when left alone and even if it is a temporary problem, she deserves help getting through it. We are more than happy to help her but we have never done this before and need help ourselves as we do not know how to approach the problem. Our inexperience and need for help should any issues arise was made abundantly clear when we were asked to foster (the president of the rescue asked us to help out, which we were happy to do since we were considering it anyway). No matter how much we asked for help, we rarely get an answer.

We had previously looked at adopting an adorable malamute mix with separation anxiety, and decided against it because we thought our first dog having anxiety issues would be a bad idea as we were not confident about our ability to properly handle it without any experience. Again, I totally get that it's way too early to diagnose anything, but after weeks of dealing with howling and scratching and chewing and getting silence, if anything, from the rescue I was ready to go insane.

It really just comes down to the lack of communication - and this is where my main question is. What sort of help do you expect from a rescue organization when fostering a dog from them? I know they're probably dealing with a million other things and may not have time to walk a pair of panicking first-time foster parents through how to handle anxiety symptoms, but I feel like we were crazy for asking for help so many times. We had larger problems getting things they said they would provide for us - a lead for our backyard, harness to help with her pulling, some more durable chew toys - but again I have no idea if those are things a rescue will typically provide or if they're supposed to come out of our pocket. The rescue told us they would be providing anything we needed but the only things they have actually delivered on are a gate and food.

Are we crazy and needy? Was it just a shitty situation, having two people who couldn't have someone home at all times handling a dog who hated being alone?"

532,[Breeds] Whippet vs. Border Terrier,dogs,t3_a83nyt,8,False,False,a83nyt,"Hello r/dogs! I’d appreciate some advice on picking the right breed for my partner and I. I filled out the breed questionnaire a few days ago but only got one response. I’m on mobile otherwise I would have copied and pasted.

After a lot of research and lengthy discussion, my partner and I think that either a Whippet or a Border Terrier might be right for us. We’d love to hear some opinions about these two breeds with regard to our lifestyle. In summary - we are a moderately active couple living in a one bedroom apartment. We have multiple parks around us and enjoy revolving our life around our dog! I go into a lot more detail in the breed questionnaire.

We keep tossing up between the two (very different!) breeds. We don’t want to start contacting breeders before we are absolutely sure on the breed we would like. In saying that, registered Whippet breeders are a LOT more common in Australia (100+ Whippet breeders vs. &lt;40 Border Terrier breeders). But that shouldn’t be the deciding factor.

I’d love to hear your thoughts if you have had experience with either breed, or if you have any other breed suggestions we are very open to hearing them. You should be able to find all the information that you need in the breed questionnaire (my post history), but feel free to ask further questions. Thanks in advance!"
533,[Discussion] How Frequently Does A Cattle Dog Puppy Need Care?,dogs,t3_a7zx3m,3,False,False,a7zx3m,"3 years ago I had IT admin job where I worked from home. I was able to get a Cattle Dog puppy and raise him and give him training and play myself multiple times during the day. It was cool how he even as an adult he would still try and sit in my lap like he did as a puppy, even though he grew to 70 lbs. Unfortunately he was attacked unprovoked and killed by a pitbull off it's leash 2 months ago.

I really miss him and would like to get another puppy, but I work in an office now so I can't be home to let him out every few hours. I can look for another job that works remotely, but was curious what the recommendations are for how often they need interaction during the day.

Also, is getting an older puppy an option? I got my last puppy right at 6 weeks, but if I get one at 3-4 months does that affect thier bond with you as the owner at all?"
534,[help] Dog refuses to poop on a leash.,dogs,t3_a7zwne,2,False,False,a7zwne,"Zero is a 6 your old Great Dane, lab mix. He has lived in the house with access to a backyard for 5 years and has never had to poop on a leash before. He is completely fine on walks and marks everywhere, walks are actually his favorite part of the day. However, no matter how often or how long I walk him, he will not poop while on a leash.


I just moved to an apartment complex so there is no way I can take him off. There's no dog park nearby that I can go to to let him loose, so I don't really know what to do at this point. He gets fed only at night and hopes that in the morning he'll have to go bad enough that he'll just go on our walks. When I was feeding him twice a day, he would poop on my rugs in the house while I was at work.  He has never once had an accident in the house before this, and I know that he feels really bad about it.


I'm kind of at a loss. I walk him 15 to 30 minutes per walk and about 5 walks a day. We go all over the complex, even to the parts where it's mainly trees and no people or cars are around. His recall is 50/50 so I don't feel comfortable taking him off. I've tried a regular leash and am now using an extendable (I know everyone hates these, pls just spare me) in hopes that he feels less ""forced"" to be near me.


Does anyone have any advice? He feels bad. I feel bad. We all feel bad. Thank you. "

540,[Fluff] Love your dogs (And/Or your cats... I guess... ;) ),dogs,t3_a7ueeg,1,False,False,a7ueeg,"2016 was without a doubt the worst year of my life. I nearly lost my Mum to Cancer. End of a 10 year relationship. ""Homeless"" for a moment (Not truely. I was in a hostel, so thankful for that). And June that year marked the start of a 19 month saga whereby my ex did some shady things and essentially stole my dogs. 

It cost me $10,000 in legal fees to get them back. But worse, it cost me 19 months without my two beloved rescues, in a deep pit of depression. That's all I want to say about that (unless anyone wants to ask me stuff. I'm an open book).

But in March this year, I got them back. My Lab, and my Husky are home. I have legal bills to pay, and I'm ""behind in life"" because of the stress and anxiety of that situation and the time I devoted to fighting for them.

But they're home. You can forget about everything sad I just told you. That's why this is [Fluff]. My dogs fixed me. They are my world. The worst days I'll have going forward won't be half as bad as they would have been without them. They are the joy of my life.

I know if you're on this thread, there's a good chance you feel the same way. But promise me you'll never neglect them. Never take them for granted. Never look at them as a burden. They'll never ask for more from you then food and love. 

As bad as my situation was (and it was bad), I consider myself to be the luckiest person in the world. My dogs were taken from me. It was as if they were dead, but then I got them back. Very few people can call themselves that lucky.

I had a few good friends who lost their dogs this year. And I'm sure that's happened to many of you this year, or in the past as well. And if you have a pet, it will happen in the future. There's no softening that blow. So to anyone who is going through that loss, or know what it feels like, I wish you well, especially at this time of the year.

If you're near a dog right now, hug it for me, and for yourself. :) I am."
541,"[Discussion] If your dog has unexplained seizures, check his/her dog food for Rosemary extract",dogs,t3_a7kg4q,242,False,False,a7kg4q,"Both of my dogs were on a diet of Blue Buffalo kibble. My youngest started having grand mal seizures around 1.5 years old. I took him to the vet and they concluded that he has epilepsy. They wanted to put him on medication for it, but I knew that the meds had bad side effects. 

His seizures were still coming pretty far apart and never more than 30 seconds so I did some research and found that spices like rosemary, sage, and fennel could trigger seizures. Lo’ and behold, all the Blue Buffalo kibble and treats had rosemary extract in the ingredients list. 

I started looking for a kibble that didn’t contain rosemary, which is surprisingly difficult! I’d say 95% of the kibbles I researched contained rosemary. Taste of the Wild doesn’t, however, and since I’ve been feeding him that, he hasn’t had a single seizure. We’re just about a year seizure-free! 

Edit: I’m not trying to pretend to be a scientist and say that rosemary is definitely the cause of your dog’s seizures. I know this is anecdotal, but it’s something that’s worked for me, and rosemary is a trigger in some dogs. It may not end your dog’s seizures, but it’s an option to look into. "

she’s perfect for me in a lot of ways! very sweet, affectionate, trained pretty well, not super high strung (she is almost 13!), and good with cats. she does have a few special needs, most of which i know i can manage, but she had her eyes removed a few years ago and i don’t know anything about that.

am i totally out of my mind to consider this as someone who’s never had a dog before? or any special needs animal at all, really. my cat has immune deficiencies, but he needs two yearly checkups instead of one and super consistent vaccines, and that’s pretty much it.

There are people who are genuinely mean inside and I'm wondering if dogs experience the same to varying degrees?

I might be anthropomorphizing. I have a Shiba who's been pretty stereotypical of an aloof and independent Shiba. I know we're not supposed to call our dogs jerks but he really is sometimes. One time when he was much younger, I made a horrible training mistake where I was giving him frozen peanut butter kongs to eat while crated to help him adjust to being crated. The mistake was me taking his kong away before he was done because I put so much PB in there and through some trust/exchange exercises, he lets me take his treat without growling at me. 

When this was happening, he had this weird look in his eye, like an upward angry warning glare right before he would growl. The closest I can compare it to is like a wolf stalking its prey? 

Lately I've been training him to stay out of the kitchen because he's been pushing his boundaries and whenever I tell him no, he gives me the same kind of glare instead of his usual puppy eyes. I don't know if I'm uncomfortable because I was so shocked that he snapped/growled at me the first time. My husband says he senses weakness (I spoil him).

The past 2 years she has been suffering from kidney failure and a progressing heart murmur. It's long beem to the point where she's needing a diaper 24/7. Of course, her personality still showed, until I went away to college. She started sleeping more and more and eating less and less, up until these past 2 weeks where she stopped eating entirely. I feel personally responsible because I left. I feel as though I caused her to give up. 

I'm also worried about our other poodle who was raised by Scully. Scully was a breeding dog before we adopted her and she came packed with motherly instincts. Our toy poodle, Zoe, was adopted so she could have a puppy to raise. I'm worried Zoe is going to become heartbroken. I know I certainly am. 

Anyway, Scully is a great dog and it sucks to see her go. She's lived a long and happy life, but she deserves to live forever.

I don’t know what to do. Has this happened to anyone else? "

550,"[Fluff] As a first time dog owner, I just feel I need to share.",dogs,t3_a7z19z,3,False,False,a7z19z,"Hi r/dogs! Just after moving in to our new apartment, my gf and I adopted two 8-month old mutt sisters, Mari and Juca. I know a lot of posts here by new dog-owners are all about puppy regret, so I was kind of ready for that. Luckily, in the week or so we've had them, I have been feeling nothing of the sort, at least yet! I love them, cuddle with them, and don't mind their doggy smell, picking up their poo, or, you know, not having a life anymore, which were some of the stuff I feared I would not adapt to. :) Still, I would like to share some concerns and questions, more to know if these things are normal and hear other's experiences, either to reassure me or to tell if I'm doing anything wrong. I have been all over r/pups101 and youtube for a long time leading up to this, but of course practice is harder than theory.

1) Potty training is hard! Right now I'm on vacation and so can focus entirely on them, but there will be days when me and my gf will both be working long hours and will only be able to walk them once a day. So, when they *must* go at home, I would like them to go on the newspaper in a designated area in the laundry/kitchen area. The problem is they sort of elected the middle of the living room as their preferred spot for pooping! Everywhere I look on the internet, people tell me to praise them and give treats when they do the right thing, but how can I do that when they have not once pooped in the right place? When walking them, they are inconsistent. Sometimes they poop, sometimes not, sometimes in the morning, some in the evening. Everytime, I praise and give treats, but just this morning Juca didn't poop even after 24h since last time, and after eating (and I walked 1h30), so I'm just sitting at home vigilantly watching her. I know she will go in the living room but I'm not sure what to do if I catch her in the act. Is all this normal and will it come with time, or can it go on like this for ever?

2) As this subreddit seems very US-centered, please bear in mind that, culturally, people differ greatly in their attitudes to dogs. Where I live, while people adore their dogs, crating dogs is virtually unheard of. We are keeping them at night locked in the kitchen/laundry area (and also when home alone), and just this is almost shocking to my gf (who is a native). So crate training is out of the question...

3) I know adopting siblings is a bad idea. But I did not know it at the time. Again, these are basically rescue dogs, so the people previously in charge of them have no knowledge of such subtelties, they think it's extra cute that they are sisters, and would not give them away separated. I still did not need to separate them, and so have been walking them together (with zero previous experience), so it has been fun as you can imagine! Again, culture here is more laid back about these things.

4) RIP shoes? Is that the long and short of it? What do people do in practice? Simply never leave shoes where they can reach them, or is there another way?

5) Hobbies. I like to paint in my free time. Can anyone maintain a hobby owning dogs?

These are my experiences so far! Any input is appreciated, and sorry for the wall of text."

He first did on Monday night, but we had been to his first puppy play class so I assumed maybe it could be from excitement. Then the next night there were no accidents, but then this morning when I went to take him out to the bathroom he had done it again. All over. 

The first week and a half of him being home, his kennel was in the same room as me and I slept next to it. His kennel has been in a separate room for a week and a half now and he doesn’t whine at all, so I assumed it was going okay. I put it in a different room because I have to get up at night and he wakes up instantly the moment I move. 

Does anyone have any ideas why he is doing this or how we can help the situation? We take him out to go to the bathroom every 3-4 hours at night"
553,[Breeds] Looking for help choosing breed of new dog! &lt;3,dogs,t3_a7srvh,22,False,False,a7srvh," 

1. **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

Will not be our first dog. Replacing our recently passed Lhasa-poo mix, who lived to the ripe age of 17. He was a lazy turd, but was well trained and very treat-motivated. Personally, have never had an issue training dogs and didn't have any obstacles with ownership, so open to new experiences.

1. **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?**

Prefer a reputable breeder. Where I'm located, (Oregon), there seems to be a bit of a shortage of pets, as there really aren't a whole lot of rescues that I have found near me. If anyone from Oregon has a few recommendations other than the Humane Society, i'd love to hear them!

1. **Describe your ideal dog.**

Looking for a loving, medium dog. I feel that it's a vane request, but I really (obviously) love beautiful, athletic dogs like the border collie and Australian shepherd. My preference is a high life expectancy, few medical issues and above all very intelligent.

1. **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I absolutely love Border Collies, Australian Shepherds and similar due to their insane intelligence, loyalty and the millions of posts of ""man's best friend"" regarding these breeds. I'm not a huge fan of labs and golden retrievers, as many of my friends have a few younger purebreds that are extremely lovable but beyond wild, which i'm sure comes with the fact that they're younger and not super well trained. Additionally, another friend has a German Shorthair and Brittany which are hunting dogs, whom are both super loving and friendly, and their temperament is spot on with being laid back and relaxed, but they're almost too open to other people and not super ""loyal"" to their owner. They are VERY well trained. Kind of looking for a middle ground between ""active and hyper"" and ""laid back and loyal"".

I have heard mixed reports about JUST HOW MUCH exercise working dogs need, as from personal experience two of my friends have Aussie shepherds that are super happy with simply good, long walks. With this in mind, I'm 100% open to recommendations of other breeds, and criticism/ideas, or tips if I were to go this route.

1. **What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Looking to do the basic stuff, heel, sit, stay, lay down, go, fetch etc etc but really would love to play with expanding on additional stuff too. My main goal is to have a dog that is extremely responsive of those commands, rather than knowing 3 million different commands.

**Care Commitments**

6.	**How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

About 2 hours per day of exercise, i'd imagine. Give or take an hour or so for sure. There would be constant companionship though, when i'm home in the morning and back mid-day.

**7.	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

Probably about 2 hours a day. Have a large yard and a park across the street. We have a local dog park, but i've never personally been to it. We also have pretty much immediate access to multiple forests and a very very large community park attached to another large community park, so there's definitely places to walk/hike, play fetch and socialize.

**8.	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

Preferably no home cleaning (ears, etc) but we did pay for a professional groomer. If it's occasional/daily brushing along with the groomer, there's no issue there.

**Personal Preferences**

9.	**What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium would probably be the preference, 40-80 pounds.

**10.	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Preferably no slobber, but a bit of shedding and barking isn't a huge issue.

**11.	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

Fairly important. Not a deal breaker, but would for sure be nice for walks around the neighborhood

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12.	**Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Snuggly for sure.

**13.	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

Eager-to-please is a big upside, but independence would not be a bad thing either.

**14.	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

Protection is not a huge deal where I live, but interactions with strangers and visitors should be positive rather than aggressive.

**15.	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

I'm willing to manage, as our last dog was confrontational towards bigger dogs when he was younger, but began being more receptive once we were able to socialize him more. Unopposed either way, but the dog would be alone in the home w/o another pooch so that is something to keep in mind.

**16.	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Not particularly. Licking always pisses me off.

**Lifestyle**

**17.	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Generally about 4 hours a day, give or take.

**18.	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

**19.	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

We do have a (gecko? idk) smaller lizard in one of our rooms, but it's behind a locked door in a glass enclosure.

**20.	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Not in the family, neighbors do have children though. Will always be supervised.

**21.	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

No

**22.	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

Portland, OR.

No.

**23.	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

Generally about \~35-40 in the winter and \~70-80 in the summer, with obvious outliers. Can get up to 100 and down to 20ish, but is rare.

**Additional Information and Questions**

**24.	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

Do go back and forth between a second house every few days for a day or two which has a family member with a dog allergy, so while the residual hairs are not an issue if they shed, bringing the dog with for a few days is not an option. With this in mind, wife/kids would for sure take care of the dog while i'd be gone."

557,[Help] My dog has basically stopped eating the past 2 days.,dogs,t3_a7uq9l,4,False,False,a7uq9l,"Hello r/dogs,

I have a little monster of a Maltese-Shih Tzu  that I love more than anything; he has always been a fussy eater (won't eat certain dog foods, loves certain brands for a period of time then won't go near it) but now it's come to the point where he hasn't eaten anything but a pork chop I cooked for him yesterday morning.

My dog has a process when it comes to eating. He will stare at me as I chop up his meat and put it in his bowl, and then stare at said meat for a period of time, probably making sure none of my 4 cats are hovering around, but he knows they stay well away from his food. 
My dog will then pick up a piece of meat and either run to the couch and smash it back, or run outside and hide it for later use. I'm not sure if this behavior formed when he was a puppy and had a large litter of brothers and sisters to compete with, or he is just a fussy little thing. Since I moved in and met this dog (just over a year) he has adapted to eating in the morning when I'm around, and again very late at night when I'm home from work because he knows he will get a Shmacko when he finishes his meal.

A friend with a girl dog has asked if we could try and mate our dogs. He met her a few days ago, and to say the least, he's smitten. Since he's met her, all he's eaten is the pork chop that I hand-fed him twice yesterday.
I don't know if this event has caused him to stop eating, or maybe something to do with my Guinea pig giving birth a few days ago. Or maybe he is on strike to demonstrate expensive raw meat is the new way to go.

I will be going to the vet tomorrow and talking about some kind of anti-anxiety pills and hope she has some idea of what is going on.
I am sorry for the wall of text, I get off track sometimes, but I was hoping some people have had this issue with their dogs and have any advice.

560,[Fluff] So very thankful my puppy is alive and well—being a new dog mom is a rollercoaster!,dogs,t3_a7p3l2,4,False,False,a7p3l2,"I’ve always grown up with family dogs but those puppers chose other members of the family as their “hooman” so to speak. For example, our last family dog (English bulldog) really bonded and preferred my mom. 

After our bulldog, Max, went over the rainbow bridge some 5 years ago our family was open to having another family dog. 

Eventually Bam Bam, a 5 month old shih tzu, chose us. I immediately felt a close bond with him, unlike our other beloved dogs, and just chalked it up to the new puppy smell and puppy dog eyes. 

But over the past month we’ve had him in our home, I have spent the most time with him because the rest of my family have busier schedules. My mother has since deemed Bam Bam as my fur baby and I’m now his dog mom. 

Last night when I took him out to go potty, I noticed that he had something in his mouth. It looked like a weird old vegetable peel or maybe even a mushroom. 

I panicked since mushroom poisoning in dogs is very serious and something to watch out for. I asked everyone if they thought it was a mushroom but it was hard to tell. My sister and I looked up as much as we can regarding the different poisonous strains. My parents and my sister reassured me that none of them looked like that thing in his mouth. We made a plan to observe him for the next couple hours and rush him to the vet as soon as we noticed something was up. 

I felt sick to my stomach the entire night. I kept thinking I should have done a better job at keeping an eye on him. We crate train him, but I decided to let him sleep on my bed to make sure he didn’t have and delayed symptoms. I kept waking up to check on him. 

Over 15 hours have passed and so far my dog is as normal and snuggly as can be. He was probably confused why I was so anxious last night. I realize now that I may have overreacted but I can’t help but feel extremely grateful that he’s with us and chose me as his human. 

tl:dr I’m the primary caretaker of our puppy and I thought he had eaten a poisonous mushroom when I took him out last night. He hasn’t shown any symptoms and I may have overreacted. But I’m extremely glad he’s ok.

562,[Help] Good Supplements for old dog joints.,dogs,t3_a7tznt,9,False,False,a7tznt,"So my Lab is 10, and still in good health, and pretty mobile. Walks at full speed and can get up to a good medium pace in the park for short amounts of time.

He used to weigh 50kg before I rescued him, and it took a toll on his back hips. He lost most of that weight but is putting a bit back on just due to being a bit less active because he's a bit older and slower.

I've got him on some weight control food to help with that, and walking him lots, and it's getting better. (Unfortunately, budget reasons right now are preventing me from getting him premium food, or a completely raw diet, but he does get lots of bones and veggies etc). And over the next few months I'll be really looking for a great diet for BOTH my dogs.

I have a 7yo active husky (who also happens to be a fussy eater), and the lab above. So their requirements are a bit different. SO, keeping budget in mind a little bit, but without resorting to low grade shit...

1. Can you suggest a good diet that works for both?

2. If not, can you suggest a diet for each?

3. Can you suggest some great supplements for my lab in particular, to help him move a bit more freely (he doesn't have hip problems. Just old creaky joints).

563,"[Help] Dog toys that keep dogs super interested, and last.",dogs,t3_a7twdg,5,False,False,a7twdg,"Hey guys, TL;DR.... see above. :) (But if possible, be brand non specific, as I live in Australia so may not have the same range as you).

So basically, I have a 7 year old husky (energetic but knows how to relax :)) and a 10 year old Lab (pretty happy just chilling. :) ). They get on lead walks at least 3 days a week, and off lead park runs at least three times a week, and pretty often a road trip to a cool beach some place. That's a minimum of 6 days, but it's more when possible.

But I'm a freelance photographer/filmer. Some days I'm out on set, working, (No different to a 9-5 really). But when I'm not ""working"", I do all the other stuff I need to do (Marketing, retouching etc) from home.

I love this freedom because I get to spend a lot of time with my pups. I love to play with them, and I love spending as much time as I can with them. But...

Sometimes when I'm home with them, it's a ""work day"". I have to treat it like one, and that means ignoring them a bit, staring at a screen. Patting them if they come up to me (which I love), but generally they just lay down next to me. If I move to get a drink or use the bathroom, they get up and follow me like we're about to do something fun. Honestly, it feels bad, so quite often I take 30+ minutes to just be with them. But that adds up in terms of time not spent working, which actually leads to later nights and not being able to ""switch off"" at 5 because I didn't get enough done during the day.

So... I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for toys that will last a while (so I won't need to rebuy constantly), will keep them occupied, preferably won't result in too much mess (I live in a share house), and that they'll love, whether they're right next to me or alone for the day.

They do like to play together (tug of war with a rope for example), but they tend to do that almost for my amusement. :) They make sure I'm watching before they start. And as soon as one wins, the other is left with nothing to do.

Feel free to shout out some brand names, but I live in Australia so I'd rather hear about styles of toys if there's options, because I may not be able to get the brand you mention.

Oh, and it doesn't have to be a ""toy"" either. Tips welcome. But not food related. I often give them a bone to work on during the day, and Snickers (the lab) doesn't need any more food. :) (He disagrees).

Also, just to be clear... this is for their enjoyment, and for professional reasons. My Lotto dream is to quit everything and live on a beach with them and a supermodel who's also incredibly kind, intelligent, witty, funny, sweet and perfect for me, and me for her. (I won the lottery in this scenario remember? It's possible. But I'd take a regular woman who ticks all those other boxes too. :) So if that's you, feel free to hit me up... ;) )

568,[Help] Pain-Induced Aggression in Dog,dogs,t3_a7ui4p,2,False,False,a7ui4p,"Hello,

I have a 2 year old Corgi/Lab mix who has recently injured herself in her paw. It was a very deep laceration which caused a lot of bleeding and pain. My family and I took her to the vet where she was quite aggressive and nippy when they applied a bandage, and she is still very aggressive to us today. We can not approach her without growling or her trying to nip at us. She is very distrustful of anybody. This is especially problematic as she continues to chew on her bandage, preventing it from healing properly. We use a muzzle which helps calm her down and prevents her from biting, but is difficult to put on the dog, and becoming more difficult to put on overtime as she dislikes it. We also have a Elizabethan-style cone but it is a little short and our dog can still access her wound. 

The bandage is due to come off Saturday but this still has caused a lot of stress in my family. To give context - my dog has a history of resource-guarding with rawhide bones/treats and is excitable around strangers. I have been working on her around strangers and she is not ""aggressive""; rather just nips when she gets too excited. She is also very nervous around other dogs, especially when she is on a leash. She is better off leash around dogs but still distrustful. We bought her improperly using Kijiji and not analyzing her parents/her own behavior, but I really do not want to give up this dog from this bout of stress. 

Please reddit, how should I deal with this? I've been searching online but the only advice they give is to go to the vet and the pain will subside (which it obviously has not, even though she is on some painkillers). How do I prevent this behaviour in the future?

He’s recently picked up this habit of going to the back door and taking incredibly deep breaths. To explain further, this backdoor has a gap at the very bottom where air from the outside gets in. He’ll put his nose right down to that spot at take deep breaths with audible exhales. We were wondering if this was a health concern or just a quirk of border collies. Anyone care to explain?"
571,[HELP] First timer about to rescue but not sure about living conditions,dogs,t3_a7vg7p,8,False,False,a7vg7p," Hey everyone, a friend of mine is actively working with city's dog shelters. Bringing food, raising money etc. After seeing me with strays and telling her that some day I would like a dog she suggested that I should adopt one. I'm 28 yo man living alone and am financially and (finally) emotionally ready for the responsibility. However the reason I did not adopt yet is I am not sure my home environment is available for a dog. I live in an apartment about 70 m2 (750 ft2) and I am at work most of the day (I work 8 hours a day but with commute etc I am outbetween 8 am to 7 pm ) so I don't think that small of a place and being alone would be healthy for any dog. But she insists and tells me it would be ok...

So I am here looking for other opinions. What do you think? I know my conditions are not ideal but are they better then the stray shelters?"

My dad puts her out against her will once in the morning and once in the evening every day and she just does her business. Sometimes when my dad isn’t around, however, we don’t know if she’s gone out for her morning/evening pee. And if you ask her if she wants to go out she hides under her blanket. Once we discovered that she hadn’t gone out to use the bathroom for a day and a half! And she still opted to stay in when prompted to go outside.

And I suppose the real question here is: How does your dog tolerate days that you don't run?

I  have a 2 year old, 30lb mix named Lady. I'm thinking about turning some  of our morning walks into runs, as I used to run a lot awhile back and I  think she would enjoy getting to stretch her legs more. But I'm not in enough shape to run every single morning. I'm concerned that just  running some days will cause her to expect a run every morning and a  walk won't be enough exercise for her anymore. Having her run around not  with me isn't an option because I don't have a yard, unfortunately.

I’m due with our first baby in February and we can’t exactly be stacking suitcases next to an infant car seat. 

I don’t want to crate the dog because a) he hates crates and b) he wouldn’t be able to look out the windows (which he currently has to sort of prop himself up to do because he has stumpy legs). Does anyone have any ideas about how I could perhaps divide the back/trunk so that we could safely have both the dog and some stuff back there? Maybe some sort of cargo net rigging?

577,[Help] Dew nail looks lifted from the quick but no pain or blood?,dogs,t3_a7svwr,1,False,False,a7svwr,"I was cutting my dogs nails when I saw her dew nail looked weird. I'm assuming the smaller white nail is the quick and the large shell is what used to be her nail. The nail/shell is totally lifted from her quick.

She is not in pain. There is no blood. She is letting me touch it. It has been 2 weeks since I cut her nails and I have no idea when this happened. 

This was my first time cutting her nails. We always went to another place to get them cut. She is 1 year old tomorrow. She only just started letting us touch her arms and paws without squirming so this was the first time we could get her to sit still long enough to learn how to cut her nails without hurting her.

* What are the pros, cons, is it intimidating having your dog jump and latch onto your arm? 
* Did you do it for fun, did you compete?
* Is this something I can do with a still relatively young dog? (she just turned one year, but she was spayed super young so I don't want to do anything that will put too much pressure on her joints yet)
* What should I work on before starting the beginner's class?
* Is it all corrections-based? (this is something I will ask the clubs, but curious to see if the sport has moved toward a balanced approach)

I'm thinking about this, disc, or agility in the spring to start. She's a fairly confident dog, loves using her nose and her obedience training is going well. She's a shepherd mix, is pretty laid back, loves to use her mouth while we play, doesn't go over threshold unpredictably."
579,[Help] 1yr old Rottweiler refuses to put weight on rear leg.,dogs,t3_a7ujwa,17,False,False,a7ujwa,"**Edit: As I feared, it's her CCL. She'll be having a CORA Based Leveling Osteotomy in about a month (the surgeon is booked out). On the bright side, I'm in a place where I can afford the surgery, and it's winter so I won't feel too bad keeping her cooped up for recovery. It's her birthday today, so once her sedatives wear off, I'm going to make her a kibble cake with some bacon.

**I have already made an appointment with our vet for tomorrow**

I took my 1 year old, 95lb (yeah, I know she's bordering on too big for a girl, but she came from questionable origins) Rottweiler to the park today to finally enjoy the unseasonably warm (46F) weather. She went into heat over Thanksgiving, so we haven't been able to go for nearly a month. During that time we took a few walks and ran around the backyard and in the house, so while not as active as before (we would hit the park 3-5x per week, plus walks) she wasn't completely sedentary either.

 When we got there, we were the only ones so she was able to walk/trot around to check out the smells and warm up slowly. A short while later a young mastiff showed up to play, and they hit it off, lumbering around like big dogs will do. They played for a while, then each went off on their own to check things out. Soon my dog initiated play again, and as she was coming back from around the trees, she let out a little whine and raised her rear paw. I went to her to check it out. She let me move her leg, no reaction at the hip or knee, but didn't want me to check her feet. There was a dime sized drop of blood on the snow. She took a few steps, and would just touch the very tips of her toes to the ground.  I carried her (a ridiculous sight I'm sure, since I've only got her by 30lbs) to the entrance gates, ran to get the car, and took her home. 

Once home, she was very eager to get out of the car and into the yard. Still limping, but wanting to sniff around and mark her spots. Headed inside, she didn't let her sore leg slow her down going up the stairs. I got her to lie down and let me check her out. After an initial warning groan, she let me feel out her foot and I didn't find anything unusual. I gave her meal (appetite is as good as ever) and crated her. I've been taking her out every couple of hours to see how she moves. She is still reluctant to put any weight on the leg, but is determined to still get into things, climb onto the couch, and sneak bites of food from the bag. She will sit normally (sloppy puppy sit to either side), and is willing to lie on either side as well.  She just will not put her foot all the way on the ground. My late, smaller, Rottie was prescribed Piroxicam (an NSAID) for arthritis and cancer pain, so I gave her one to help her be comfortable for tonight. 

I guess what I'm wondering is, has anyone had any experience with similar symptoms? And what was the diagnosis?  I'm thinking maybe a CCL, though that wouldn't explain the drop of blood (I did find small, fresh scab on her neck, though, so the blood may be unrelated), or possibly an issue with her toe/toenail since she didn't want me poking around her feet. It's also possible I missed and injury between the toes.

TL;DR Young dog is limping, wondering what it could be. Will see vet first thing tomorrow."

586,"[help] Need help about a puppy in the care of someone maybe not worthy? Bad title, read in for details.",dogs,t3_a7trj1,5,False,False,a7trj1," 

Okay, I know this won't necessarily be the best place for this, and redirection to the best sub will be welcomed...

And please, helpful advice only... we're truly worried about this.

Story:  Our Golden Doodle girl had nine puppies, but while we are not breeders,  we did all we could to make sure they were healthy and as importantly;  that they went to good families.  We asked for a fair price, and  everyone paid accordingly... except one .. she asked us if we could  split as she was looking for a good puppy for her 8yo son, who has a  medical condition (won't specify) and needed a therapy type dog....  and  she was only shy $50.  We wrote up an agreement to have the other  portion paid by the end of this month (December).

We waited 18 days to send out one reminder text, as we wanted to wait long enough but also not annoy during the actual holidays.

My wife and her became friends on FB.

Tonight, we found out first that she had deleted her... and at first did not reply to my text.

That's a concern... but it's nothing compared to what we discovered next.

The  woman is now under investigation for 'allegedly accidentally' running  her child over in a school parking lot (caught on camera).  The boy is  currently in critical condition.  This happened 8 days ago.

She  did respond to my wife and said she had deleted a lot of people out of  embarrassment and don't believe everything you see or read.  She said  the puppy was with her daughter over at her Sister's house.  This  suggests that she had her other child removed from the home.  She has  sent further texts discussing getting our address for the $ and talked  about the puppy, but we are greatly concerned.

What we would like to get out of this is:

1. the  agreement was full payment by Dec 31st, or we have the right to reclaim  the puppy.  We don't expect to receive the $.  The mother is out on  $10,000 bond at the moment.
2. We  are more concerned about the child, and if he pulls through, we would  prefer that he not only keeps the puppy but that the little one helps  him recuperate.... we have no desire to separate them.
3. Caveat:  We are now extremely concerned about the mind set of the mother, and  what other things could happen... and since we are only allowed to  contest the welfare of the puppy; if we should consider pursuing trying  to reclaim her.

So,  right now the situation seems to be that she wrecklessly drove her car  in the parking lot, knowing full well her son was outside the car  (hanging onto the door handle) and that he was run over in the  process... we have a puppy in their care that is still in the process of  being paid for.. and we have written contracts stating that full  payment must be received for her to claim full ownership.  We want the  boy to have a fur friend forever, ad we want that forever to be.. a very  long time... but we also love the little pup and wonder if we should  try to get her back .. especially before something happens to her.

Thoughts and advice, please.

Much thanks."
587,"[Help] After months, my rescue dog still stays under the bed in our spare room about 90% of the time. Lately I've had limited success in getting her out a little more, but could really use some ideas! Thanks!",dogs,t3_a7nlsf,19,False,False,a7nlsf,"Darla came to us 10 months ago. We've only had golden retrievers before and she's our first rescue. She is a big girl, shepard mix, who was dumped after giving birth. She'd been at the shelter for about a month when we brought her home. She gets along fine with our golden and they are about the same age - 4 years old.  I suspect she wasn't so much abused as neglected. She didn't know what dog biscuits were, didn't know how to ride in a car, didn't know how to PLAY, at all. She fundamentally doesn't understand about play (and gets stressed at the dog park when dogs chase one another).  She's a little more aggressive in that situation and very protective of our other dog.

She spends 90% of her day in the bedroom that is in the far corner of the house, somehow cramming herself under the bed. I set up a crate for her and have tried other ""cavelike"" setups to help her feel at home, but she likes that spot. I thought that she might come out of it after a bit, but she hasn't really. Just lately, I've tried anew. I'll call her upstairs and give her lots of approval and when she tries to leave, I call her back and give her a treat.  Rinse and repeat.  By doing this, I've gotten her to stay with the rest of us for an hour, which is huge for her.  My question is -  if she wants to be the goth kid and have a lot of alone time, should I be messing with it? It seems to me that dogs are social creatures and she'd be happier if she learned to be part of us. Should I keep rewarding her just for hanging out with us? Are there better rewards than food rewards?  (Or is there a better approach to bringing her out of her shell?  We've tried blocking off the 'hideout' room and she just seems unhappy and anxious, so we stopped.)

Thanks so much for your help."
588,"[Discussion] Take it from me, don't adopt two puppies from the same litter.",dogs,t3_a7boq1,293,False,False,a7boq1,"tl;dr - Littermate syndrome is a very real thing and can stress you and your new family members out.

I did my research and asked the appropriate questions prior to deciding to adopt a dog from a breeder. I was informed to stay away from the idea of getting two puppies from the same litter, but told myself that my wife and I would be the exception. We were not an exception.

Feelings started to take over when visiting the breeder and interacting with the puppies. We went from ""1 only"" to ""Why not both?"" quickly. Puppies and their cuteness have a way of convincing you. We even asked the breeder about how close the siblings were and were told that they act independently. We took somebody for their word and got burned.

While I don't feel angry at the breeder as they're relatively new (comparatively) but have had positive results with their work among other people.

We knew we were going to have to remove any chance of Littermate Syndrome forming, or reducing its effect. Since first day we brought them home we decided to walk them separately and the other one will go into panic mode. This includes barking, howling, whining, urinating, pooping, you name it. It doesn't stop either, it will go on as long as the other is gone despite if another human is the house. This is limited to walking, but even being created in separate rooms, separate crates in the same room, or just simply being in separate rooms with no way to get to the other. While social with other dogs and people, you can sense an alarming amount of hesitation. The amount of anxiety was beyond anything we've ever since in dogs. We realized we had fucked up.

We've since decided to return one of the puppies to the breeder. We understand we do not have the time with our current schedules to devote to breaking this strong bond they have with each other. Let alone training them which would require them to separate AND together. It was a mistake, an expensive one at that, but it will become unreal for what damage it can cause to each other, us, and others. I can only hope that the other puppy can find a forever home that can meet it's needs. I can also hope that the breeder will change their practice of adopting out their litters since this was made aware to them.

For those considering adopting two puppies from the same litter, please take a moment. Think to yourself if you have the time to meet all of the needs it will require of you. Unless you are a very well experienced trainer, I would highly suggest not doing so."
589,[Help] Terrible first fostering experience. Am I crazy?,dogs,t3_a7tdco,0,False,False,a7tdco,"This is a little long, so TLDR: My SO and I are finishing up fostering a dog for the first time, and it's been a nightmare. Are we being crazy and expecting too much from the foster organization?

SO: My partner and I have been wanting a dog for ages, and we finally moved into a place with a nice backyard and a reasonable pet deposit. We were a little nervous about going full commitment to a dog, so when an opportunity came up to foster a ~1 year old beagle mix it seemed like a great idea.

From the start, though, it has just been an incredibly stressful and un-fun experience. We work opposite schedules generally, and there are only 2-3 days a week where the dog would need to be crated for at most 8 hours (we are sometimes able to come back for a walk at lunch, but not always). We were told by the rescue that the dog's previous foster worked similar hours so it would not be an issue. From the start, however, whenever we left her alone she would be obviously stressed out and break out of her crate. The rescue gave us some info on crate training but after a few weeks of that there was no improvement and the dog was getting even more stressed out. It is also worth noting that the dog only had these problems when we left, otherwise she was perfectly content to sleep in her crate and went in voluntarily very often. She howls incessantly during the day, according to our neighbor. When the rescue got us a gate and suggested we try gating her in a room, she tore down the sturdy gate. She has scratched the hell out of exit doors in our house (the front/back doors she sees us walk out of).

Some of the chaos she's caused when alone is just inexperience. Every time we come home and find something chewed up, it's a new lesson in puppy-proofing the house, and that's fine and to be expected. But the rescue kept blowing off the clear *symptoms* (not necessarily officially diagnosable behavior) of separation anxiety. We understand that many rescue dogs go through a decompression phase and that the amount of time can vary drastically, but this dog is incredibly stressed out when left alone and even if it is a temporary problem, she deserves help getting through it. We are more than happy to help her but we have never done this before and need help ourselves as we do not know how to approach the problem. Our inexperience and need for help should any issues arise was made abundantly clear when we were asked to foster (the president of the rescue asked us to help out, which we were happy to do since we were considering it anyway). No matter how much we asked for help, we rarely get an answer.

We had previously looked at adopting an adorable malamute mix with separation anxiety, and decided against it because we thought our first dog having anxiety issues would be a bad idea as we were not confident about our ability to properly handle it without any experience. Again, I totally get that it's way too early to diagnose anything, but after weeks of dealing with howling and scratching and chewing and getting silence, if anything, from the rescue I was ready to go insane. 

It really just comes down to the lack of communication - and this is where my main question is. What sort of help do you expect from a rescue organization when fostering a dog from them? I know they're probably dealing with a million other things and may not have time to walk a pair of panicking first-time foster parents through how to handle anxiety symptoms, but I feel like we were crazy for asking for help so many times. We had larger problems getting things they said they would provide for us - a lead for our backyard, harness to help with her pulling, some more durable chew toys - but again I have no idea if those are things a rescue will typically provide or if they're supposed to come out of our pocket. The rescue told us they would be providing anything we needed but the only things they have actually delivered on are a gate and food.

Are we crazy and needy? Was it just a shitty situation, having two people who couldn't have someone home at all times handling a dog who hated being alone? "

591,[Help] [Breed] Help finding the ideal dog breed for someone who is really active but works most of the day.,dogs,t3_a7r2gd,2,False,False,a7r2gd,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

  * I have had a dog all my life, and have trained one dog right from being a puppy.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

  * I really like the look of Spitz type dogs due to the upright ears and pointed snouts.
  * Large sized.

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

  * Either works.

13. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

592,[Vent] [Discussion] Why is it so hard to find good dog food?!,dogs,t3_a7po6x,25,False,False,a7po6x,"After a year of awful digestive issues and trying several different foods I was finally able to find a food that didn't bother my dog's stomach. Well fast forward two years and now my vet is telling me to switch my dog onto a new grain-inclusive food with the new DCM research. My vet didn't specify any brands, just to avoid grain-free varieties and newer brands. From what I've seen online it seems like most people recommend Royal Canin, Hills Science Diet, and Purina, but a look at the ingredients lists for all three brands makes me wary.

Royal Canin (Large Adult) has chicken by-product meal as the first ingredient.

Hills Science Diet (Advanced Fitness Variety) has pea fiber as the second ingredient , whereas other varieties have corn/corn meal high up on the ingredients list.

Purina Pro Plan (Bright Mind Chicken and Rice) has poultry by-product meal and corn gluten meal in the first five ingredients

WHYYYY is it so hard to find a dog food that has a specified protein source as one of the top ingredients without by-product meals and questionable fillers as the next ingredients? Has anyone found the holy grail of dog food? If so, you deserve all the awards.

593,[Help] Dog is prone because of hip injury. Ways to keep him comfortable?,dogs,t3_a7qqmi,3,False,False,a7qqmi,"My 12-year-old mini Australian Shepherd recently dislocated his hip and his doctor says that his femur cannot be placed back into the joint so he will never be able to use that leg again, and he will not be able to walk again.

So he is prone most of the time, and I’m wondering if any of you have any suggestions for items that can I make him more comfortable.

I am wondering if there are dishes, bowls that will be easier for him to eat or drink from – note that he cannot really raise himself up on his front Legs into a sitting position either. 

What about carts? Two- and four-wheel wheelchairs for dogs? Is anything that he could use where he could remain prone, remain in that cart, move himself around, and still stay  comfortable?

I’m also wondering, hoping, if any of you have known a dog who has pulled his hip out and the doctor said it couldn’t be put back in, and if there was any solution. Right now it seems like there isn’t one. I really hope my doctors are wrong.

Thank you in advance for any help you can give."

It was a nightmare to find an apartment that accepts dogs in the country I moved to do I've been living in a hotel. I finally found one but can't move in until March. I will bring her across then.

I just feel really guilty about leaving her then returning and leaving again. But what worries me more  is she's now used to having lots of people around her and when I bring her across it'll just be me and her and I'll hire a dog walker  for when im at work but I'm wondering is if this is fair ? Would I be enough ? 

My parents are close to 70 so they couldn't look after her long term despite the fact they love her to death and dad walking her has really improved his health. They have arthritis so haven't been good at keeping up with her brushing as she has am insanely thick coat she looks like a Swedish lapphund despite being a street dog from Cyprus so I've been paying for monthly dog grooming appointments. Realistically they cannot care for her adequately long term.

Do you think it's best that I bring her with me in March or do you think she would be happier surrounded by more people and staying with my parents ? 

I would love her to be with me as she really improves my welbeing and I can tell she loves me the most but is it fair to deprive her from all of the people just to be with me ? 

She likes beinf by herself a lot and finds a quiet place in the house to sleep so I think she will be ok when I'm at work and have a dog walker mid way through the day.

599,[Vent] I feel like there's something psychologically wrong with people who dislike dogs,dogs,t3_a7zmfr,1,False,False,a7zmfr,"I know they say people who don't like dogs are wired differently than those who do. But I've met a ton of people who do and don't have dogs... They aren't so different. However I've also met many people who HATE dogs too. They sincerely dislike dogs and the idea of a dog somehow disgusts them.

Without fail, the dozen or so people I've met who are dog haters have some kind of psychological problem. They aren't normal people.

Not like they were traumatized by dogs...but more like they have insecurity problems and almost fear dogs will somehow compete with them. Ironically doh dislikes are boring as hell and a dog would make them interesting.... Strange how they fear a dog's competition against their boring lives. 

The quality I found most common among dog haters is their passive nature for life. They all tend to share a similar trait in that they are extremely boring and not someone you could or would want to talk to. They had low expectations in life and were very consumed with themselves and being the center of attention anywhere they go... Ironically they were often too boring to be the center of attention anywhere they go... But they still tried like hell.

Every dog hater I've met is insanely boring, spoiled, insecure or all three. It's like these are prerequisites for disliking dogs. 

I was thinking about this the other day and have come to the conclusion that the all the people I've met didn't like dogs all shared these traits. Almost as if they were worried a dog would take away from their own attempts at trying to be interesting and not boring... I met around a dozen peoole like this in my lifetime and every single one had these traits... I call it the ""mediocre but in  denial"" quality.

It's so bizarre and quite sad. When someone doesn't like dogs, to me, that's like saying they don't like chocolate.

But I've found these people are so because of their own deep seeded insecurities... Non dog owners are boring as hell to me but people who dislike dogs altogether are psychologically damaged in my experience.... If they did a study I bet they would prove this.

Since college I realized I met exactly 14 people who hated dogs and would never even consider getting one
... No allergies or anything like that. Just super boring, spoiled, or insecure.

I bet I'm not alone in this observation.... "

601,[Help] I'm afraid I'm not giving my pup the love and attention it deserves.,dogs,t3_a7on45,15,False,False,a7on45," I'm a highschool student with a busy schedule, and so I made the STUPID decision of getting a puppy, thinking I had everything planned out perfectly. I guess not.  
 The puppy is about 3 months old, and it hasn't gotten all of the vaccines required to go out yet, so it's inside the house full time. We also have a crate. Since I gotta go to school, my mum lets the dog out of the crate to run freely around the house for about 3 hours. Sometimes, we let it run around the huge balcony, and it has a blast up there. But, it has to go back to the crate for 1-2 hours so that my mother can do some house chores without being afraid of smacking the puppy across the face with a broom.  
 When I come home, I make sure I give it a lot of attention for at least 1 hour before I study. After I go up to my room to study, it usually remains out of the crate for another hour, until we're all busy doing afternoon stuff, so no one can look out for it. In the evening, it gets some more time with us outside the crate, until it's late and we gotta go to sleep.  
 Not counting bedtime, it gets about 4-6 hours of crate time daily. Not all in one go, of course. Is that bad? Should it not be there that long? Am I doing a bad job? :c"
602,[Breed] [Help] Pitbull lover looking to adopt my own dog - I want a dog that I can rely to be non-aggressive and that would be ok around cats,dogs,t3_a7rz6p,26,False,False,a7rz6p,"** Update: Thank you for all of your responses. They’ve all been incredibly helpful. 

I’ve been giving it a lot of thought and have decided that I am going to look at local rescues for the breeds other people have suggested. That said, I am not going to *completely* rule out pits either.  Instead, I’m just going to wait for the right individual dog and reach out to the rescues to find an older dog that is really happy living with cats and gets along well with other dogs. 

Whichever dog I get, I’ll be sure it’s one that I know I can give the adequate amount of exercise, training, &amp; attention to. I feel comfortable that I am a responsible dog owner and someone who puts a great deal of thought before putting an animal in any situations that might be stressful (or just new &amp; exciting) - so will just need to be honest with myself if I will be happy making the type of adjustments I may need for whichever individual dog I adopt. (I’m recognizing there are trade-offs and I may not be able to find everything I want in one dog, which is ok too.)  

I also think I may get a cat first so that I can remove the “it’s really lonely without having a pet for the first time in 28 years” factor from the equation. That will make it a bit easier to allow myself the time to find the perfect dog, even if it makes introducing them a little more challenging for me.

Filling out the questionnaire was a *really* helpful exercise towards really being honest with myself about the time &amp; energy commitment I’m able to make. I hope every prospective dog owner takes the time to do this, even if they think they know what breed they want. **

*eta: I seem to have messed up the formatting - I’m on the mobile app &amp; am not sure how to fix it 😕*

Hi r/dogs! I‘ve lost both my cat &amp; my dog in the past year and am ready to bring some new life into my life. 

The thing is, pitbulls have been my favorite breed since I was a kid (30+ years ago) and I’m having a hard time opening myself to any other breeds. (I’ve filled out the breed questionnaire below) 

I’m not at all against getting a pitbull, but the one I lived with ended up being euthanized after he attacked/mauled his owner on 3 occasions (we think he was protecting me). I don’t want to get into graphic detail, but it’s the most violence I’ve seen in my life &amp; I still have nightmares from it a year later. (please don’t judge me - it was not my dog and I tried to handle it as responsibly as possible, given I was not its owner).  

It wasn’t entirely out of the blue, the dog had been reactive towards its owner on past occasions, and my sense is there may have been some abuse going on (this person is no longer in my life). He (the dog) had also been on Prozac that the owner decided to stop giving him &amp; discontinued without consulting a vet or going through a weaning process. 

They’re still my favorite breed and I’m not afraid to be around pitbulls (I still felt safe having the other pitbull sleep with me even after the attacks), but it’s made me a little anxious about living with one (I live by myself and am smallish and female). I’m worried it will “turn on me” or hurt my (future) cat.  

Can you help offer some suggestions that might open up some other options for me or ways to be sure I’m adopting a dog whose temperament I can rely on? 

Top priority is being able to have my dog share a home with a cat and no aggression towards people or other dogs. I’m open to adopting an older dog (5-6 yrs old) 

Thank you! 

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I had a pit bull basically dumped on me when its owner left town for a year. He was not an easy dog; I was not prepared to be a dog owner, but I did my best and made sure he was loved and well-cared for (but admittedly was in over my head - he definitely was not a “first time dog” kind of dog). I lived with the dog for almost 3 years, part of the time his owner lived with me. 

That said, I don’t have any experience training dogs. There was a weird dynamic with my last dog since he wasn’t really “my” dog and his owner was weird about not wanting the dog to like me better than him -  kind of an “all the responsibility, none of the authority” situation. (I sometimes refer to the dog as “my dog” since it sounds less confusing). As mentioned above, things took a really bad turn. 

(Despite the challenges, I absolutely loved that dog with all my heart and he’s the reason I want to get a dog.)

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescue. I get the value of going to a reputable breeder, but my passion is animal rescue, so I don’t think I’d be comfortable buying a dog. (It will be an older dog; not a puppy) 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* The most important qualities: Non-aggressive &amp; able to be trusted with a cat. 

Easy going, loving, likes to snuggle. 
Has the energy to do easy hikes, walks, etc. but won’t lose their mind if exercise is offset by mental stimulation. The type of dog you can bring for a walk with your friend’s dog or take to a dog-friendly cafe/bar. Derpy goofball is a bonus. 

Fairly low maintenance. One that has an average or longer-than-average life span (I just lost 2 pets in the past year)  

I’m kind of a tactile person, so maybe not so crazy about a scruffy dog if it’s fur isn’t soft to touch. (Not a deal breaker though) 

No bulging eyes or snorting breathing.

A dog who is solid &amp; can make me feel safe.  

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Staffies/Pitbulls - I love their derp factor, that they have the energy for active stuff but are also couch potatoes, that they’re such snugglebugs, &amp; their fat heads. I also feel safer home alone &amp; out walking with them.

I also like border collies, Australian Shepard’s, German Shepards, lab mixes, standard poodles, and any sort of medium to large scruffy/shaggy dogs (but from what I’ve read about the breeds, worry they may be either too high strung, energetic, easily bored, or have high prey drives) 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience commands for its safety &amp; mine (sit, stay, come, drop), fun stuff like “high five” would be nice but not necessary. Ideally, I’d like to eventually train it to be a psychiatric service dog, so Canine Good Citizen skills, DPT, blocking and guiding me to nearest exit (this isn’t a deal breaker for me though)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I’ll be spending most hours of the day with my dog. I’m home almost all day and will bring the dog with me when possible. I figure the training is kind of an all-day, all-the-time thing, but am figuring 1.5 - 3 dedicated hours of quality time (focused on what the dog wants/needs) a day (including walking &amp; grooming). 

I also plan on going to obedience training and maybe agility training (only for fun &amp; to keep the dog happy, not competing or anything)

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* At least one hour (2 half hour walks) each day. The type of exercise would depend on the dog - beach, hiking trails, using my bike or a scooter alongside it if its energy level exceeds mine. If I’m honest with myself, it’s not so much a matter of how much time I have, it’s a motivation issue - part of why I want a dog is because it forces me to get out of my house. I’m in decent physical shape so can handle the extra exercise. 

The dog park makes me a little anxious to be honest.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I’m fine with trimming hair &amp; nails, giving baths, and cleaning ears. If the dog loves getting brushed, I’ll brush it daily - but don’t want a dog that will have issues with its coat if I miss a few days.

I’d prefer not to have the added expense of needing a professional groomer but it’s not a deal-breaker. I’m also fine with trimming its fur myself if that’s a thing. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* medium to smaller end of large - I don’t really like small dogs (I mean, they’re fine for other people). I like a dog who’s got enough weight that it calms me when we snuggle on the couch. My place isn’t huge, so a super large dog isn’t ideal. My 75lb pit bull was fine in here, but I probably would prefer a dog closer to 50lbs so that I can lift it or carry it if safety or health issues require it.  

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I’m not a fan of shedding. I don’t mind hair getting on the furniture, but ideally, I don’t want a dog that sheds all over anyone who visits or that my carpet is covered with hair if I don’t vacuum daily. Barking depends on the circumstance. I live in an end unit on a busy street, so barking every time someone passes outside would get old. Barking non stop when left alone would be an issue too, since I live in an apartment. I get that dogs bark - I just don’t want it excessive/constant. (Yipping is out. I don’t have a high tolerance for dogs that yip). Slobber is yucky, but dogs drool. I’m not a huge fan of feeling like I need a towel every time I pet it, but my last dog had issues with licking his paws and I’m used to giant wet spots on the couch. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It’s not vital, but I feel like it would open up more opportunities for playing/exercising since I don’t have a yard. At the very least, I’d like a dog I could train to be let off leash for safety issues (like if I dropped the leash or it got out or something) 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I don’t know if I have a strong preference on this - I want a dog that wants to be with me, but I’m fine if it is happy to just be in the same room doing its own thing. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking when someone comes to the door is fine; not barking is fine too.      I don’t want a dog that will be reactive/aggressive with strangers &amp; visitors. As long as the dog can be trained to go to their pillow or their crate &amp; settle down, I don’t have a strong preference. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. This is a dealbreaker. I have too much anxiety around my dog hurting someone else’s dog. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Any sort of aggression. As mentioned above, dog I lived with ended up being euthanized after attacking his owner and I still have a lot of anxiety around something like that happening. Plus I don’t want a dog that I can’t trust around an indoor cat (will make sure the cat has “escape routes”, etc., but it’s still a concern I have)

Yipping or non-stop talking/barking. (Walter the French Bulldog is adorable to watch in a 2 minute video, but I’d lose my shit dealing with that all day long) 

I’d like to avoid a dog that is prone to “piddling” whenever they get excited. 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Generally no more than 1-2 hours at a time a few days a week. Maybe 4-5 hours once or twice a week (if I take a class or go to a movie or dinner with friends). 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* It’s just me. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I plan to get a cat/kitten 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Breed/weight restrictions are not a concern. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* There aren’t any breed laws in my city

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* generally between 70-85° except during heat waves. I think it sometimes drops to 50° at night in the winter (I’m in SoCal) 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

604,[help] trying to play with my dog,dogs,t3_a7pcf7,4,False,False,a7pcf7,"5 months ago I adopted a 4 year old Red Heeler. 

About once a week he will get into a weird mood where he constantly paws at me, and boops(punches) me with his nose. I'll try to play with him with toys, but he'll start ignoring the toy after 10 seconds. This devolves into 20 minutes of belly rubs before he finally calms down. 

He usually does this not long after a walk, so I don't think he wants to go out. I've never had a dog do this before, but I've also never had a heeler. 

Any suggestions about what he is doing or wants? is this totally normal, and I should just accept my new life as Official Belly Rubber?"
605,[Help] the high prey drive dog I'm adopting is also extremely shy,dogs,t3_a7rgic,6,False,False,a7rgic,"I adopted my dog from a breeder (who lives in a rural area) when she was 5 months old. When I brought her home to the city it took her a little while to get acclimated to the sounds of cars starting unexpectedly and just being in a more noisy environment, but has done great. She loves all other animals and though it takes her a little while to warm up to new people, she loves them after getting used to them. I socialized her a lot as a pup and she's great in any situation I've put her in. She's a complete sweetheart. 

The breeder had kept her littermate sister, but soon after we picked up our girl, breeder ended up getting sick with a chronic and potentially terminal illness that required her to travel a lot out of the area for treatment.  I dont want to make any assumptions, but I am guessing the other puppy was not socialized properly due to the breeder being so ill. I met both puppies together and both were friendly and sweet at 5 months old. So,  the breeder said she was putting up my dog's sister for adoption (now 2 y/o), and I was immediately interested. The breeder said she had high prey drive and was shy which I thought about and decided that was something I could handle. After talking to her again she stressed that the dog isnt just shy, but extremely shy. She isnt at all aggressive, but will cower when meeting new people if her owner isnt present. She does great at home and loves being around her people and is fine when new people come over as long as her owner is there, but isnt great in new environments. She also said she will be better in an environment with another dog. 

I have never had an extremely shy dog before. It sounds like she may also be codependent. I feel like the reason she is so shy is possibly due to neglect, which breaks my heart. I think I still want to give it a trial run, is this crazy? Any advice from people with shy rescues? I am willing to get a trainer and do what it takes, but I really dont know what to expect. My first instinct was to try and socialize her, but after some internet research the best thing is to take it very slow? I also want to add my first priority is providing a safe and happy home for the dog I currently have, will bringing a shy dog home have any impact on her? "
606,[Help] Advice for Integrating my New Puppy,dogs,t3_a7r94l,2,False,False,a7r94l,"Hi All- I have just introduced a new French Bulldog puppy (12 weeks old), Frankie, into my home where I have a 1.5 yr old male French Bulldog named Biscuit. Neither are neutered. Whenever I first got Biscuit my vet in Seattle, who specializes in the breed, recommended that we not neuter him until he is 2 yrs to ensure that his muscles and bone development aren't stunted before he has fully filled out. Biscuit is super personable and friendly- including with other dogs. After bringing Frankie home to meet Biscuit for the first time this past Saturday- Biscuit was very apprehensive and confused. He barked and snapped at Frankie several times so I put Frankie inside a small crate and left it in the living room so that Biscuit could get used to his smell, presence etc. I would take Frankie out every so often and let them further socialize. It seemed to have worked and after 48 hours they are playing like best buds however Biscuit still has moments where he snaps at Frankie causing him to yelp, cry and run and hide, which breaks my heart to see. When Biscuit does this I spray him with water bottle and say a firm NO BITING. Biscuit runs off, hides as he knows he did something bad. I'm on Day 5 now and while they are playing, I don't trust leaving them unsupervised as I worry Biscuit will snap/bite him again and not be reprimanded. Any tips or tricks that you all can provide me for breaking Biscuit of his snappy tendencies? He usually snaps at Frankie over toys or treats. I am thinking of having Biscuit neutered asap but worry that this could throw the balance of power off between him and the new puppy since Frankie won't be neutered until he fills out. Any help is appreciated! I've heard e-collars are a good technique but I don't like the idea of shocking Biscuit to cause pain, which is why I use a water bottle. Thanks in advance."
607,[Help] Alternatives to Koha Stew?,dogs,t3_a7qujj,2,False,False,a7qujj,"We adopted our first dog a couple months ago, a chihuahua mix.

610,[Help] How long is too long to walk a large breed puppy? (4 months),dogs,t3_a7q3j4,7,False,False,a7q3j4,"I see a lot of guidelines like ""5 minutes per month of age twice daily"", but 20 minutes twice a day doesn't seem like nearly enough for our aussie/golden retriever mix. If I took her in after 20 minutes, she'd still be bouncing off the walls. But if I let her set the pace on our walk or take her to the dog park, it's an hour-long walk before she finally slows down.  


I know Aussies are bred to run around all day herding sheep, and she got quite a few aussie traits, but she'll be a larger dog (65-70lbs) and I'm worried about hurting her joints/bone development if I let her exercise until she's tired while she's this young. But honestly... 20 minutes twice a day just really doesn't seem like enough to tire her out so she can chill out with us in the evenings, and it takes about 10 minutes just to get to the off-leash area near our house. Am I causing more damage than good by letting her stay out this long, or is it ok since she's setting her own pace?"

613,[HELP] Is my puppy playing normally?,dogs,t3_a7pi6h,9,False,False,a7pi6h,"I live in an apartment with my 6.5 month old puppy. Our neighbours across the hall from us also have a puppy who is a bit older - we got our puppy after they had theirs. It worked out nicely because their puppy had all of their vaccination shots when we got our puppy, so they have been playing with each other since we got him. Lately I have been concerned that they are playing with each other properly, though. My puppy does not interact with any other dog/puppy the way that he does with her and my neighbours say the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

When we go to take our puppies out and see each other the dogs go crazy. They are always begging and whining at each others doors to play. When they do get together it's just constant growling and snarling at each other. My neighbours female dog is mostly the submissive one and will often roll onto her back with my puppy on top of her. They bite at each others neck/face/ears, but generally they do not cry out anymore in pain (they used to as younger puppies, but now it's just the growling and snarling). Sometimes my puppy will be more interested in looking for things to eat off the ground so he will ignore my neighbours puppy, which pisses her off and she will keep trying to bite and instigate more playing. Other times they will ignore each other alltogether and just lay on the ground hanging out.  


Is this normal puppy playing? I know it likely is - they just sound so aggressive and vicious when they are playing. With other dogs my puppy will be more submissive and will often jump up to try and lick the other dog's face. I have seen him playing very gently with smaller puppies before and he is absolutely submissive with bigger dogs - he will usually adopt the playful bowing pose.

I took him to the few different vets and they say he is healthy.

He is 1 year old male and I think he is mix between golden retriever and something else. I got him from a local shelter when he was really young.

617,[Discussion] Destructive pup,dogs,t3_a7p5r9,6,False,False,a7p5r9,"So I've got 2 dogs, one of which is about 11 month old boxer-pit. She is relatively destructive as of late.

We used to lock them in the kitchen, with access to the yard when my wife and I would go to work (~8 hours alone). They were doing well, so I gave them access to the rest of the house. The pitbull-boxer would find anything on the table she could get at and destroy it. No problem, nothing on the table. I like the excuse to keep it clean. However, she has started destroying my couch now. Both pillows gone, and now she's progressively tearing apart the fabric on the side of the couch, so I set up a camera to watch. I leave around 0700 and she looks on the table, finds nothing, then goes to sleep on the couch. Around 0900-1000 daily, she and the other dog start playing, and then she starts to tear at the couch. So now they are back to the kitchen. I tried putting dog beds in the kitchen for them, but they lasted one day before destruction.

So my question, is this separation anxiety? She doesn't start tearing apart the couch until about 2-3 hours after we leave, so I'm leaning toward not SA. Is this puppy phase that she'll grow out of? I do exercise them about 1 hour daily throwing the ball when I get home, so I don't think it's too little exercise. Would this be something that CBD treats could help?"

So, that's that.

Anyway, she's going CRAZY. She can already be a bit of an intense puppy (heeler mix) but this is insane, and I'm used to intense dogs. She wants to be with me all the time and even tries to climb on me while I'm working, despite never being particularly clingy before. She seems to have forgotten all of her commands. She had appropriate chewing down pat until she went into heat, and now she's eating my house. She's harassing my other dogs who she previously got along with just fine.

I'm obviously not really upset with her as I know those hormones are making her a little crazy and she can't help it. But I'm just wondering if there are any ways I can help her be a little more comfortable and calmer, aside from the usual stuff like exercise and training.

620,[Discussion] Dog Went Missing But Returned Under Kind Of Strange Circumstances,dogs,t3_a7kr77,6,False,False,a7kr77,"Maybe I'm overthinking it but just wanted to see what others thought.

My dog went missing, she was round my parents(they live round the corner), dog was in front garden, apparently my mum had stepped inside for a minute, came back out and she was gone.

This was really unlike her, she never likes to go to far from other people's sight. My mum thought she couldn't have gone far and went looking but with no luck.

She came and got me and before I knew it half the village was out looking for.

To absolutely no luck.

Around midnight I came home, at this point everyone in the village and Facebook knew and was watching out for her.

The whole situation just didn't make sense to me, she isn't the sort to wander off, she doesn't even chase cats. 

She also instantly responds to any kind of whistling, with half the village whistling for her.

Then at 1am I get a call, she's back! It was the greatest thing I had ever heard, it was true bliss.

Apparently my parents dog had started barking and she was at the front gate.

The weird part though was she was warm and dry, it was cold and had been raining several hours (stopped about an hour before finding her).

On top of this, my dogs not a barker and the front gate is far from their house, it seemed strange for my parents dog to just start barking.

End of the day I'm just glad she's back and I'm never letting her out of my sight again.

Most likely she just got lost but part of me wonders if someone could have taken her locally and then dropped her off when she became 'to hot to handle' or they saw she was spayed and had very unquie markings (she's very easy to identify).

Maybe I am overthinking it but one thing I will say that I've learnt, is you can never be too careful."

628,[Breeds] Thinking about getting a dog,dogs,t3_a7jwzo,11,False,False,a7jwzo,"Hi,

I've been putting some thought into getting a dog for the first time. I read the info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/first-time-dog-owner), and while I have a lot more planning to do and decisions to make before I go through with this, I was curious about what breeds, ages, sexes, and so on I should be considering. I'm making plans to ""test drive"" some of my friends' dogs, so maybe I'm jumping the gun a bit by posting here before I do that. Don't take me too seriously, but I'm interested in your opinions.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This would be my first dog

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I think I'd prefer to rescue, but I'm not opposed to a breeder. I'm actually interested in ""trying out"" an older dog that's already trained and a bit more mellow. I'd love to hear opinions about whether this is a good idea. I definitely *don't* want to deal with a dog that has major issues or will cost a fortune in healthcare. But I like the idea of a shorter, less high stakes, but still mutually beneficial relationship.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I'm not sure if this is realistic, but since you asked: A dog that could not rip up my house for 8 hours (more realistically, 4 since I live literally next door to my work and could let it out and even walk it during lunch. It would be capable of running at least 5 miles, hopefully it could do more as I got into running longer distances.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Australian Cattle Dog: Would be physically capable of running or hiking. Smart. Looks cool as fuck. Sounds like it could be difficult to deal with for a new owner though, particularly a younger dog.
* Malinois: Also looks cool.
* Golden Retriever: Seem to have a reputation for being easy to care for and train. Adorable.


5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Run with me
* Hike with me on multi-day camping trips (off leash would be kinda cool, but I'm not sure what the expert opinions are on that as far as ethics)
* I assume obedience is a given? I want to be able to take it out in public without endangering other people or the dog. I don't want a dog to be something I have to constantly worry about misbehaving.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Excluding exercise? Is it wildly unrealistic to say maybe .5 - 1 hour of direct interaction?

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I'd like it to be content with about an hour of jogging, 5 - 10 miles. I don't know a ton about dog parks but obviously I'm not opposed to the idea.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing is fine. If it's easy to groom at home I'd do it, otherwise I can afford to pay a pro.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* 50ish pounds or larger

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle shedding. Barking wouldn't be great, I like my neighbors. I'm not a huge fan of slobber.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I'd really like to be able to do this.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* No strong preference, they both have benefits

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I don't want it to suffer while I'm at work 40 hours a week, and I don't want it to kill my social life. I'd like to be able to go out once a week after work for say, 4 hours after walking the dog. And on the weekend I'd like to be able to spend one day without babysitting the dog other than taking it for a run at the end of the day. Are those reasonable expectations?

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* It's okay, perhaps even desired, if the dog barks a bit to let me know someone's there. I don't want it to jump on people out of joy, and I don't want it to growl at people and scare them away. Between those points I don't have a strong preference.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* It doesn't have to live with other dogs or kids, but it shouldn't act aggressive towards them out running or during brief visits.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Definitely no humping people. I fucking hate when peoples dogs do that to me.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I broke this down in detail in 13, but I work 40 hours a week (either 5 x 8 or 4 x 10). I live next to work, so I might even be able to get away with 2 half hour visits a day. I'd like to be able to spend one day of the weekend away from home the majority of the day. Hopefully taking the dog with me when I can, but sometimes I wouldn't be able to.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent. No breed or weight restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Warren, MI. I'm not aware of any, but I don't want a rottweiler or pit bull anyway so I doubt it matters.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* summer: 80f, winter: 30f

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

Do I have unrealistic expectations for the amount of care a dog would need?

Is a senior dog an okay idea? Would I be an awful person if I wasn't willing to spend more than say, $1000 on emergency or chronic medical issues (routine check ups or mild illness not included)?

Any great resources for first time dog owners? Obviously I'll research this myself as well, but it's always nice to get personal advice."

So people of r/dogs, what would you want as a gift if you worked at a doggy day care facility?

Quick note: I'm not exactly certain of the number of employees, but it's around 5. I'd like to be budget conscious as well.

I have been wanting a dog for my husband and I since we got married 4 years ago.  I am currently a nursing student and my husband is also a student (online) and also gets paid to work mostly from home. I currently have a month and a half off and thought that would be a good time to get a puppy and establish a schedule. My husband would mostly take over when I started school again (however, he has to move after he graduates this summer, while i stay with the dog to finish school). We got an awesome puppy 2 weeks ago but since we got him I have been questioning my decision. He is a possibly a corgi/aussie mix and for a puppy he is great. However, since getting him I have felt extremely stressed and over-emotional. I feel guilty and like a failure that I cant even take care of a puppy without getting so worked up and stressed. I got a puppy to feel less alone when my husband leaves but right now I feel more alone than before I got a puppy. I have tried and talk to my husband but he doesn't really say much. People get puppies all the time with no problems, why is it so hard for me? Has anybody else felt this way, how did you get over it?"

635,"[Help] Advice on how to proceed with a blind, deaf, senior beagle",dogs,t3_a7idnh,17,False,False,a7idnh,"I've had my beagle Molly for almost 15 years. She went completely blind and deaf about a year ago, and for most of that time she has been okay. However, in the last couple of months she has been barking a lot while I'm at work, no doubt because of anxiety and not knowing where I am. I thought I had the matter under control but I've received a second notice from the leasing office (I'm in an apartment complex) that says she's still barking. They will involve animal control if they have to send a third notice.

I've thought about trying to re-home her, though I'd hate to do it, but I don't know how feasible that is when she's blind and deaf and 15 years old.

I take her for walks when I can but she's not especially mobile, so she doesn't tire out. I tried anxiety medications at one point but they didn't seem to work too well. The vet prescribed a sedative, but I got the second notice anyway - apparently it hasn't been enough. I'm gone 10 hours a day and I can't change my schedule.

So I'm at a loss as to what to do. I don't think I'll be able to keep her with me, but I don't know where to turn for finding a place for her to live out what's probably her last year. I don't know how to solve the barking problem, if I can't find a home. I fear that she'll be taken by animal control, which will mean euthanasia.

I'm in the Seattle, WA area, if that's useful information.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
636,[Help] Housebreaking,dogs,t3_a7gsyw,12,False,False,a7gsyw,"Or puppy is about 3 months old. We've had him for about one month. He's half Yorkie, half Pitbull (we think).

I'm at my wits' end. We keep him in a small room which he will not go to the bathroom in at night and while we're away. I take him outside to do his business first thing in the morning, as soon as we get back from anywhere, and frequently when I'm home. He always has access to food and water.

However, he still pees and poops in the house like 10 times a day. Sometimes as soon as he comes in from outside.

I praise him verbally, physically, and with treats whenever he goes outside. Every time he has an accident, I put him outside immediately.

I believe this has, unfortunately, conditioned him to pee or poop when he wants to go outside, rather than conditioning him to go outside to poop.

As a result, I've decided to add punishment (a spank, and/or his nose in the pee) before letting him outside in order to stop him from thinking , ""I want to go outside. I should pee on the floor"". I hate punishing him like this, and he hates it too, but I don't know what else to do.

In the past, I've also tried scheduled feedings to control his bowel movements, with no luck.

I don't think his previous owners treated him very well, but I think they were at least trying to train him with puppy pads. Based on my experiences with them, I think they probably didn't really commit to it however.

Aside from this, he's an amazing pup, and pretty obedient (I can often take him out with no leash).

What can I do? Will be just grow out of it?

637,[VENT] [Discussion] I don’t deserve my dog.,dogs,t3_a78cze,32,False,False,a78cze,"Whenever I have had a really bad day and I get home, my dog comes running when he hears the lock click in place. That exact moment is my most happiest and favourite moment I experience in my life as I see a bundle of fluff running towards the glass door. 

He sometimes sings/howls and spins around some days when he sees me. He is always there to greet me and there has never been a day where he isn’t there. He is just so overcome by joy; he even pees a little. (Yuck I know but it’s the thought that counts). 

That’s not even the best part though, the best part is when I sit down on the couch to watch a movie and he runs over and climbs onto my lap to he find a spot where he can rest his head on my leg or arm. 

It makes me realise how much I make him feel safe and loved. It makes me realise that even though I’m let down daily by people I love and care for and how some don’t put the same effort in returning that, he also helps me recover from the pain I feel when I’m so lonely at times. 

So I don’t deserve my dog sometimes, He does way more then he thinks to my heart and I love him dearly for that. So very much.

So here’s a reminder, your dog won’t be around forever. But they will always be there for you whenever, so appreciate them and love them all the damn time because they definitely deserve it.

She wasnt house trained, but we were able to get her to go outside to do her business and such after a few weeks of training. However, she has a bad habit of eating things she shouldnt eat. Glasses, retainers, credit cards, stuffed animals; you name it, she's eaten it. In the last 3-4 months (we got the puppy last January for reference) the older dogs have begun to join her in eating our valuables. In addition, they now like to pee and poop on the floors, despite being trained and well behaved for as long as we've owned them. The oldest was treated for a UTI in september, which we believed was causing him to pee on the floor. He recently started doing it again. The shi-tzu poodle has been pooping on the floor on an almost daily basis for months, and despite attempting to re-train her, she won't stop. Is this just a symptom of the two older dogs' age?

640,[Help] New job. Is 5 days a week of doggy daycare too much/negligent?,dogs,t3_a7endf,12,False,False,a7endf,"I adopted a 7 yo terrier cross approximately 8 months ago. We are very closely bonded and I spend as much time with him as possible. He is very loved. Returning him to the shelter is not an option, so please don't suggest this.

I currently work 2 jobs. I have been self-employed and worked unsociable hours 6 days a week (including all day Saturdays and Sundays) for the last year, but I have been able to bring my dog to work with me. I recently started working 2 and a half days a week in my dream job at a local university. One of the team members at the university is stepping down, so there is the potential for me to move to full-time there and shut down this other business - which is a whole other emotional conflict!

But obviously one of my biggest considerations is my dog. At the moment, he is in a local doggy daycare from 8:30-5:30 on the 2 days a week that I work at the university. It's actually been great for his socialisation and the workers there tell me that he potters around and plays with the other dogs. It is a very good daycare. He is always very happy to see me and wants to play when I pick him up. 

I live around 20 minutes from the university and could potentially come home to walk him during my lunch break, but this would be rushed and I am not sure whether this may in-fact be crueler, as he'll have 20 minutes tops of interaction during this fleeting visit, get worked up, only to then be left alone for another 4 hours. I would prefer to take him to doggy daycare where I know he is being stimulated and safe. But is 5 days a week too much? Is this negligent? I'm probably overthinking this, so please tell me if I am! 

Are there any working dog parents who use doggy daycare 5 days a week? Please share your preferences, methods and suggestions!"

645,German Shepherd Separation Anxiety [HELP],dogs,t3_a7jh0i,4,False,False,a7jh0i,"Hi all! I have a nearing-4 year old GSD named King. We got king when he was about 1.5-2 years old, from a family that didn't train him, and let their kids do whatever they pleased to him. Also, sorry for the lengthy post in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

**My dogs and cats**

In case I reference any of the names in this post, these are my dogs. I have 4 dogs and 2 cats. King the GSD, Dude the old pitbull mix, Charlie the Yorkie, and Peggy, the 3 legged Yorkie terrier, as well as Gemini the kitten and Momo the fat tuxedo cat (he doesn't do much). King and Charlie have a bad relationship. Charlie constantly antagonizes and tries to fight King, despite their size difference. For this reason, we have to keep them separated at all costs-or there will be blood.

&amp;#x200B;

**Separation Anxiety**

When we first got King, we started crate training him, like we have with all of our dogs. He does great in his crate, and will often go in it, even if I offer him my bed. But when he does take the chance to lay on my bed, he likes to chew my covers and pillows and such. He also destroys any all toys that he has. I've been trying to train him to not do that, and to behave a little bit more, but I'm lost as to how to stop him from chewing. I know that it's most likely due to his anxiety, because he only does it when I'm not looking at him or not in the same room as him.

&amp;#x200B;

**Small dog-Big dog feud**

King lays in his crate, and sometimes Charlie will run to the door and bark at him. Naturally, King will start barking back, either because he doesn't like him, he's defending his territory, or both. I've noticed now, that King will now bark at nothing because he is used to Charlie constantly antagonizing him, and I feel bad. It's like he has PTSD of it-if you understand what I mean by that. So, if you were in this situation, what would you do?

&amp;#x200B;

**Leaving the room**

When I leave the room, even if I only step 1 foot out of my door, King starts whining. When I leave for school, I can still hear him whining as I'm closing the door, and it makes me feel so bad for him. How can I make him feel safe and happy, knowing I will be coming back to him eventually?

&amp;#x200B;

**King in the yard**

Additionally, when King is in the yard, he is constantly barking at the ""neighbors"" (I live next to a convenience store, as well as a mechanic shop). He doesn't listen to me if I try to train him outside, and the only things I can get him to do are to come to me, and to sit. How would you go about getting him to stop barking at the ""neighbors"" as well as getting him to listen to me while outside.

&amp;#x200B;

**King's friendships**

Sometimes, if King is whining towards the end of the night, I'll let him out one more time before I go to bed. Usually whenever he does whine though, I let him outside and make sure he has food and water. This is when he runs to my kitchen or living room and finds his friend Gemini. An unlikely friendship, sure, but it is a friendship. King will climb on my couch and lay with the kitten, but often times I have to get him off because I'm not sure if he will start biting at the cushions and such-because if he did, I fear what my mom would do to me and King.

The relationships with King and my other animals are as follows: (n = don't get along, y = gets along)

King - Dude = Y

King - Charlie = NNNN

King - Peggy = Mostly Y, sometimes N if she's near my grandma(she's very protective of her)

King - Gemini = Y

King - Momo = Y/N, They don't really mind each other, but Momo has a bad temper and doesn't like to be bothered so if King comes near him, he hisses. No fights come of it though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Questions**

**How can I help King overcome his separation anxiety?** Pheromone Collars?

**How can I get King to stop chewing and destroying my bed, as well as his toys?**

**What is the best course of action regarding King and Charlie?**

**How can I get King to listen to me while he's in the yard, as well as stop barking at the neighbors?**

**What does normal Dog and Cat play look like?** I certainly don't have a problem with them being friends, but I want to know how much is too much and when I need to intervene

&amp;#x200B;

**Last but not least, thank you so much for reading my post, as well as a big thank you for any and all help you can give me!**

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing; I don't know is this is specific to my dogs behavior, but King likes to flip his food bowl over and sometimes water bowl over, and eat off the ground. Is this normal?"
646,“Chunky” Dog? [Help],dogs,t3_a7jfz5,20,False,False,a7jfz5,"Hi all! I’ll cut to the chase; my dog is fat. I’ve been actively trying to keep her weight off: switching to high protein, low fat food (Blue Diamond Healthy Weight), exercising/running her (much to my chagrin as I do not enjoy running), playing tug of war with her for extra bursts of calorie burning, counting her calories, weighing out her food and getting rid of all of those high calorie treats and switching to dehydrated or freeze dried meat treats and raw bones, strictly. That being said, it looks to me like she’s getting bigger? Mind you, she’s a one year old beagle mix (we don’t know with what, but most likely a larger breed dog), and she’s insanely strong- we can see her muscles rippling under her fat. But when I look at what a healthy dog looks like, she doesn’t have the curve at her hind legs, and she could use some definition in her waist (?) area. Most importantly, I want her to live and be healthy in her body. She’s always been this, erm, shapely, but when I take her to the vet they never say anything or suggest any alternatives. I’ve taken these precautions on my own after I witnessed her struggle to hop on my bed. I would like to take her somewhere to get weighed, but there are no large scales for 45 pound dogs in my area, other than the vet (which she hates because the one at our vet lifts her off the ground and whines; it’s an admittedly intimidating device for a dog afraid of hearing herself sneeze) How long should I expect to wait to see some results? If she lost 3-5 pounds I feel like she would be in much better shape. Any suggestions outside of what I’m doing to make sure she gets to 40-42 pounds by her birthday in August? Thanks! "
647,"[breed] First adult doggo, breed suggestions?",dogs,t3_a7hokp,4,False,False,a7hokp,"Introduction
My boyfriend and I are looking to adopt our first dog. We both grew up with a family dog but neither of us have been adult dog owners. We live in a 1 bedroom apartment and will be able to bring the dog to work with us, so really hoping for a well-behaved doggo. I'm definitely willing to spend time training the dog on my own, as well as with classes. Ideally the dog would get on well with 2-3 30 minute walks on weekdays and a couple of hours of activity each day on the weekend. I don't need a sluggish lap dog dog, but I'm also not looking for a dog that needs constant + strict training and tons of attention. Looking for that perfect mid-size, mid-energy pupper. One last thing to add - I think I'd have issues dealing with a high-anxiety dog - one that couldn't handle car rides or being left alone.

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
Grew up with a yellow lab and terrier mix, but this would the first dog that was primarily my responsibility. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?
I plan to rescue.

3) Describe your ideal dog.
A dog that's generally chill. A dog that wants to go on hikes, hang out at my friend's apartments, at the dog park, on the couch with me etc. Thinking 15-25 lbs and aged 6 mo to 3 years. Definitely not a super anxious/needy dog or yapper, as we live in an apartment building.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
I was looking into rescuing a smaller Jindo mix (Jindo + Terrier possibly) from the Dog Meat trade in S Korea but have some concerns about them after doing some research - any advice would be welcome!  I'm most concerned that they can be aggressive to strangers, other dogs, and visitors. I’ve heard the same can be true for Chow mixes. 
I also love curly-haired pups! 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
Basic commands like staying and sitting.

Care Commitments
6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
The dog will be interacted and played with every day, especially if I can bring it to work. I am open to a good 30-45 minutes of training per day.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
2-3 30 minute walks a day. Playing with toys/a ball in the house on weeknights. Dog park, hikes (1-5 hour hikes) or just long-ass walks on weekends.

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
I’m open to grooming at home and allowing a professional do it as well. It'll likely be a mixture of both.

Personal Preferences
9) What size dog are you looking for?
I'd prefer a small-medium sized dog. ~15-25 lbs.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
I'm okay with some shedding and slobbering but barking is definitely not preferred.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
I would like to do so but it isn't necessary.

Dog Personality and Behavior
12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
Both, but a dog that can snuggle a bit would be preferred.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
Either is fine, as long as it's not too ""hey!hey!hey!hey!"" nor extremely needy.

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
Relaxed and friendly - not aggressive.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
No but if it were as simple as making sure the dog was socialized in the beginning, and/or trained a bit I'd be willing. Not interested in a lifetime of aggressive behavior though. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
Aggression toward strangers, my friends and other dogs. Yapping. 

Lifestyle
17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
In the beginning - on weekdays from 10-6, but really wanting a dog that can come to work with me every day. I'd say ideally 8 hours, but that wouldn't be often. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
My boyfriend would share the dog with me, but it would ultimately be my responsibility. He would feed it, play with it, walk it, and sometimes take it to work. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?
No other pets and not planning on it.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
No but perhaps years down the road - friend's kids. 

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
I currently rent a 1 bedroom apartment and will continue to for years. (750 sq feet and up).

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
Los Angeles. No bans that I'm aware of.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
Summer: high 80s to mid 90s in the summer, mid 60s to low 70s in the winter. 

Additional Information and Questions
24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
I'm willing to put in some time and effort to train a dog, but don't think I can take on a dog that's high maintenance. For example, I love border collies but know that they're high-energy and hyper-intelligent and I don't think I'd be enough for that breed.
I'm not interested in a lap dog, but I also don't want a super high-energy dog.  I think pomeranians are adorable but they're too tiny and yappy. BASICALLY I'M ASKING FOR THE PERFECT DOG so feel free to tell me that my asks are impossible! 

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.
Anyone have thoughts about my interest in rescuing a Jindo mix while taking the above info into consideration? I was also looking at chow mixes but my coworkers said they might not be good apartment dogs."
648,"[Discussion] So many rescue dogs from the Southern US are being brought up North, why?",dogs,t3_a7edg6,21,False,False,a7edg6,"My wife and I lost our Great Dane a while back, he was 10 and lived a full life, but he was in so much pain from bone cancer we made the decision.

We promised ourselves that when our kids weren't toddlers anymore we would adopt a shelter pup instead of going purebred. When we started looking at Humane Society, Rescues, and other shelters/fosters we saw a TON of dogs from the South (Texas, Georgia, etc). The pup that we adopted was brought up with a bunch of other dogs from a kill shelter in Texas, and the conditions seem to have been lax (only half the litter got proper shots, dogs was underweight, etc.)

Broad brush: Does anyone know any more about why this is or background on it? It just seemed strange that half the dogs we saw came from the South (excepting the Humane Society which was mostly local surrendered dogs).

PS - We looked mostly at Great Danes and Staffordshire terriers (or dogs that had some of those breeds in them). The Staffordshire mixes were very common, of course with lots of other breeds likely mixed in like bull terriers, labs, American bulldog, etc. I do think the shelters are full of 'pit bull mixes' because some people fear them, and maybe its just the 'pit bulls' being brought up north.

649,[Help] My dog isn't interested in toys. Suggestions?,dogs,t3_a7gfyk,6,False,False,a7gfyk,"I just adopted a 1 yr old pitbull mix and she's an absolute sweetheart. Her favorite thing is just to be pet and sleep on the couch/bed next to you. I love her calm nature but when we're at home, she doesn't really do anything but sleep and I'm worried she's bored. I walk her about 3 times a day for 30-60 minutes and take her out to go the bathroom obviously. When she's out for walks, she's so excited but when I try to engage her in her toys at home, she really doesn't care. She has a variety of toys (squeaky, plush, chewing) but doesn't seem to care about them. This is my 4th dog and the first time I've experienced this. Has anyone had a dog that isn't interested in toys? Are there any toys that your dog actually enjoyed? I'm thinking about getting her a Kong or one of those squirrel pop-out toys as they're more mentally engaging. She loves her bones but I don't want to just have her eating bones all day."

My schedule is mostly evenings (2 to 10pm) so they would get a nice walk in the morning, at around 1 pm and again at 10:30 pm. Is this enough? Are there certain breeds I should look for and stay away from? If I had to choose I would like a pit bull or a mini pincher. I love those. Hypoallergenic would be nice as I am already chasing fur down like crazy. Any input would be greatly appreciated. I really don't know where to start. I love dogs and have had them in my family home.

Some cursory Google searches have only come back with info on ear infections, but her ear itself looks clean, smells fine and she doesn't seem to have any discomfort.

654,[Discussion] Just caught a neighbor kid in the cat flap petting my dogs while I was gone...,dogs,t3_a7035p,189,False,False,a7035p,".. I am totally baffled how these kids thinks this is okay. The dogs are friendly and while I trust them you never know. They are still dogs guarding their territory and while the humans are out they are in charge. She's lucky they are nice and I am lucky they are nice. I can only imagine the consequences if she ended up hurt. This girl and one of her friends will come knocking ever day at at 1.30pm sharp asking to play and pet them, and they won't take no for an answer and will keep asking all kinds of questions to drag out the time. I don't think they're older than 6-7, so I've asked my dad to contact their parents because we can't lock the cat flap either as it's very cold and our cat would get in a bad mood.

I remember being this kid when I was younger, but I was never this intense or disrespectful, and I obviously don't want to turn into 'that' neighbor on the street either. I have little to no experience with kids, so I am unsure how to best tell them off next time without talking to them as if they are adults.

Any ideas or thoughts on how to proceed? Other than having messaged their parents, I'd like to know what I can do or say if it happens again.

Edit: Puppy tax! https://i.imgur.com/IAAkffI.jpg

Edit2: Dad got a reply from one of the dads saying they'll talk to their  daughter and that he's ""more than welcome to lecture my kids as your own"" if she comes by again. They acknowledge that this is not okay and they had no idea, so hopefully we'll see some progress from this."

656,[Help] Why does my dog whine so much after a walk?,dogs,t3_a7f6pg,7,False,False,a7f6pg,"I rescued a dog from the humane society about a month ago. They thought he might be two but it's clear now he is most likely around one year old. He's possibly a lab/shepherd mix (getting DNA results back soon). 

Generally he is well behaved. We exercise a ton (I think)-- I work from home. I get up before work to walk for about 45 minutes, then walk him another ~45 minutes at lunch, sometimes including off leash play.  After work at some point my boyfriend and I will usually take him out again for 45-90 minutes (depending on schedules and his energy, and if any of our friends are at the dog park).  He gets two more potty breaks in the evening.

He eats only out of puzzle toys, and we do a bit of training every day. He has several different types of toys for tugging, ripping, chewing, and squeaking, and he sleeps through the night from midnight until 8 am. We live on the 28th floor in a condo, so going up and down involves a pretty regular routine of riding the elevator. 

In the last week or so, when we come back up, he starts whining a ton when we get inside. Usually the whining lasts about 10 minutes, where he wanders around the condo, looks at me, sometimes lays next to me to whine. Then he gets busy eating, chewing a toy, or he just passes out asleep. What could be the cause of his whining? 

He had one accident inside about two weeks ago when our schedule got messed up and we went too long without taking him outside. I noticed right before he peed inside that he whined a bit. He normally never asks to go outside at all. He lays around until we put jackets on then he knows we're going out. 

Since then I have been strict about going out every 3-5 hours. Any thoughts on the whining? Have you had this experience before?"
657,[help] 4 month Border Collie - FRAP after pool dive,dogs,t3_a7icln,2,False,False,a7icln,"Hi all.   


I have a deaf and blind from one eye, 4 months old BC.  


I have been with him for a week or so and been trough basic training commands, like sitting, come, stay, no. These commands have been really easy to teach him and our communication seems to work really well.  


We've been exercising him with a lot of long walks every day, puzzle exercise and play the full day as I have been off work.  


We live in a hot area and we have a pool. In the first days he was sitting near the pool and putting his paws into it. In a moderate way we've been teaching him how to go to the shallow part of the pool and more recently he felt confident to swim with us inside the pool and most important to exit the pool by himself as we were affraid that he would be too confident and jump unnatented.  


Today, he has been jumping and getting out of the pool by himself.   


*And here is where the problem lies:*  


As soon as he gets out of the pool he acts extremely energized (Zoomies / FRAP). This would be OK but at the same time he does his runs he also tries to confront everybody by **jumping hard into to people**, **nibbing people hands/clothes in an agressive way**, **barking and growling non-stop**. He tries to grab anything he finds in his way and agressively tries to play with it. More to that, the floor in the surroundings is slippery and I am a little affraid he could hurt himself.  


My first reaction was to keep my stance, not run behind him, and as soon as I find him in a calm state I hush him down with some petting and rewarding.  


If he does not calm down after 3 minutes or so, I place him in his sleeping place. He will cry for a couple of minutes and some minutes after he calms down I bring him back and he mantains calm and normal.  


My problem here is that after a couple of minutes he will jump back to the pool and this process starts all over again (even at night).  


I would love to know if anybody has a similiar situation, know more about what I could to to try to understand his reaction and the best ways to deal with this situation.  


Thanks!

658,[discussion] Dog collar accident... Feeling shook up.,dogs,t3_a7ciew,17,False,False,a7ciew,"My 2yo dog Lucy and 6mo pup Nelson love to play bitey face and wrestle in the living room while I chill on couch and watch. Today was just like any other day. 

Suddenly I hear Nelson whimpering loudly and I see Lucy's mouth around his neck. Initially I'm shocked that Lucy would be so aggressive! I get down and begin trying to open Lucy's jaw to release Nelson. That's when I see his green collar wrapped around Lucy's bottom two canine teeth. My stomach drops as I realize the terror of the situation

The longest 30 or 40 seconds of my life go by as I'm trying to get to that snap release on Nelson's collar. Neither of them would hold still. Finally I hear it. I'm so thankful I was able to release them. It could have been so much worse. 

After the collar is off, Nelson runs away to the kitchen. I look over at Lucy, who is trembling. Nelson's nose is bleeding. My stomach is in knots.

After a bit of time, I encourage Nelson to come back to Lucy and I. One of my biggest worries for some reason is that their relationship doesn't hurt from this. Nelson is a bit freaked out but once he realizes Lucy just wants to lick him all over and I wanna calm him and love him with many pets, he licks us both back. His nose bleed goes away after maybe 15 minutes. He seems to be just fine.

I'm so glad everyone is okay. I did a little research to find things called break-away collars, designed to prevent these freak accidents. I now know I need something like this, but I can't quite understand how they work to prevent this kind of thing, yet still function on walks.. Anyone have insight or product recommendation? Anyone else experience something like this? I'm trying to get over this but I just feel so sick thinkinh about how this could have happened while I was not home. "

660,[Help] 5 month old puppy tried to bite the lady trimming his nails.,dogs,t3_a7ez29,14,False,False,a7ez29,"Gambit is a Shih Tzu/Bichon Frise cross, I've had him since September. He is perfectly comfortable with us touching his feet, checking his nails, etc, but as a new dog owner I was uncomfortable with trimming his nails myself. My vet offers nail trimming services for a reasonable price so I set up an appointment.

When we got there, the assistant met me in the lobby, knelt down to meet Gambit for a few seconds, asked me if it was ok to give him treats (it is), and then took his leash and left to the back room without me. When she came back she told me he tried to bite her and they were forced to muzzle him, which she said had a calming effect on him. She then lectured me on ""working with his feet"" so that he'd be comfortable having them touched.

He has no problem having his feet touched or manipulated. He is fussy when being brushed, but that's it. I wasn't in the room so I didn't see what happened, but regardless, how do I work with him so this doesn't happen again?"
661,[Discussion] Preventing reactive behaviors while a puppy,dogs,t3_a7g2zg,10,False,False,a7g2zg,"I've been reading a lot about how to train and help reactive dogs. But is there a way to keep a dog from being reactive in the first place?

The only indication to prevent this I've seen is ""socialization"" and ""exposure"" to things as a puppy. But beyond that I can't seem to figure out what else can be done.

It seems that the magic happens from early exposure and socialization, where dogs cannot always assume they get what they want. There's behaving with others through interaction, and then there's the fact that not every single person or animal can be interacted with. If this is done correctly, will that help prevent reactive behaviors later?

I find it easy to socialize through interaction, but other than avoiding interactions, how else can this be done for exposure to things and having the pup understand how to manage the feeling of not getting everything they want?"
662,"[Help] how do you know if a puppy is ""the one""?",dogs,t3_a7i0od,4,False,False,a7i0od,"First, background info : my ten year old husky mix died unexpectedly last year from a mystery medical emergency. Three months ago I signed up to foster, and fell immediately in love with our second dog but couldn't keep her because she wanted to eat my cat. 

For two months I've been obsessively looking at dogs to adopt. The foster group had a couple of 3 month old pom/shih tzu mix pups come up, so I put my name down. All of the videos his foster posted showed him and his brother being active outdoors so I thought he would be perfect - a big dog attitude in an apartment friendly body.

He's been wth me for four days and is already better behaved than most adult dogs I've met. But he doesn't feel like *my* dog. And I don't mean that I'm comparing him to my husky; I just don't feel a bond. He also seems to have lost some of his gregarious nature since he was separated from his brother and really seems to enjoy being carried around.

I have to decide in two days whether he's a good fit. I had hoped to have an active companion, and though he probably just needs time, I'm also thinking that he would be happier as a lap dog. He has so many great qualities, and eventually I would feel bonded to him, but right now it doesn't feel right for no good reason. Am I crazy to maybe give up a lovely dog because of some romantic notion of ""just knowing""? "
663,[Discussion] Help! Our puppy is dog reactive... but not in the usual way!,dogs,t3_a7fntr,9,False,False,a7fntr,"So our 6 month old puppy is dog reactive.... except in an over the top “I need to be your friend please let me play with you” way...And it is EMBARRASSING. If he sees another dog on a walk... elevator... street corner... whatever 9/10  times he starts losing it. Whining, pulling, hopping, barking, etc. Simply because he wants to play. On top of that when he does get the go ahead to meet them he goes right for the face, trying to lick them and 80% of other dogs do not like it. And get snappy with him. 

I have no idea what we did wrong, he’s not poorly socialized we took him every where, we did puppy training classes, a few day care days, friends dogs, many many different people and situations. He’s completely friendly and a total sweet heart but trying to walk down the road while he’s losing his damn mind to make a new friend makes me feel like an absolute failure. 

Some other owners are fine and just laugh it off and say “better then the other way around!” And others glare at us like we are the worlds worst dog parents.  

Any advice? And to clarify we never let him run up to other dogs full blast and I step on his leash to keep him seated when meeting humans as he just really likes to lick faces of all species it seems.  

I just don’t want him to piss off the wrong dog one day, Im particularly worried about the face licking as he had an incident meeting my SO’s sisters St. Bernard, got too excited and was trying to lick his face and the St. Bernard got super aggressive... we will be in the same house again at Christmas and I’m nervous.

664,[Help] unsure if we should put our little guy down,dogs,t3_a7a87y,13,False,False,a7a87y,"We got a puppy around 1.5 years ago. He was an amazing dog who quickly learned tricks and was so playful but loving and sweet at the same time.

This summer he began getting bad health wise. He started “fly biting” (basically focal seizure) and was having a lot of trouble with his balance. We thought it may have been because of a fall and the vet said he might just be a little imbalanced from now on but seemed healthy overall.

Things have gotten much worse since then. We balked at the vets opinion and took him to a new vet and a neurologist a few months ago and an MRI showed brain lesions of unknown cause. The neurologist was unsure what it could be other than maybe a mitochondrial disease.

At this point in his life, he now seems to be unable to see. The seizure are managed. Anytime he tries to move he circles around or stumbles and falls. He doesn’t even try to walk around inside but still manages to go to the bathroom outside after much stumbling. He sleeps most of the day and doesn’t show interest in toys although he will bite on one if we hold it in his mouth for him.

Also, he can no longer eat or drink without extensive assistance. We bottle feed him water, although he’s showing less interest in that recently so I’ve been mixing some in his food. With help he can partially eat from a bowl but lately we’ve taken to hand feeding him part of his meal.

And now he has started heavily panting at random. Sometimes I wonder if it’s his way of telling us he needs something because it will often stop if I take him out or if this is related to the health issues or if he’s dehydrated (we’ve been monitoring his water intake).

His quality of life has decreased so much in the past few months and the neurologist said he may have months left.

But despite his issues the neurologist says he’s not in pain. He still gets very happy to eat food or treats and goes nuts when we get home, even if he can’t move around much successfully.  He is still very sweet and loves to cuddle. We are totally happy to be there for him and help him. 

We have another vet appointment coming up to talk about the panting and see where we stand.

I’m wondering if we’re being selfish and his complete lack of a normal dog life where he’s doing so little means he should be put down. It really does seem like he is wasting away, but we don’t wanna lose him if we don’t have to."

It's generally pretty empty save a few bikes and other dog walkers. He's reliable off leash but I always hook him up when we pass roads/other animals/on leash dogs as he still gets excited over exciting things. 

Anyway, we hit the 6 mile mark and were coming up to a road so I called him back to me, reached for the leash around my neck... And it wasn't there! 

We went back on ourselves to where I last used it but I just couldn't find it. I decided to head to the nearest pub where I knew they had dogs. We ended up walking over 2 miles past fields of cows and sheep, cyclists and a very excited puppy on leash and my boy stayed by my side the whole time! 

It was like the most intense training session EVER! I tried to limit my commands so I didn't overload him, but it was like he knew something was up so was super responsive to everything! Walking next to me past livestock, sitting next to me while cyclists went by and waiting to be released to greet the puppy.

This was the first time we've taken him to the vet, so we were slightly worried how he would react. He has been before but since we're his third owners, we hadn't had the pleasure yet.

He was SUCH a good boy at the vet! The vet praised him for being so inquisitive and curious and loving of new people. Usually the breed can be quite shy and reserved with new people.

He squirmed a little when the vet had to put fluorescent dye in his eyes to check his corneas but nothing too serious.

It was about time he got his yearly vaccines and check up so we decided to do this and save on having to get a new time next month.

He didn't even flinch when he got his shot and besides a bit of tartar (I think thats what it's called, we call it toothstones) a little too much weight and a small eye infection, he seems perfectly healthy.

677,[Help] My dog is not friendly to my husband,dogs,t3_aa2uys,3,False,False,aa2uys,"Hey all.

A bit of background: I've had my dog, a female shepherd/husky cross named Karma, for a little over three years now. She was about three when I got her and I was told she had been badly abused by a man in the past, so she would be a bit careful around men in general going forward. I'm female, so she bonded to me quite easily and we're the best of friends.

My husband recently moved in with me, as of September this year. When I'm around, she still clearly prefers my company, but will tolerate him or sometimes even indulge him in play. When I'm not around, or even if I'm just sleeping, she is very cold to him. She growls and shows her teeth when he approaches, hides upstairs from him, and won't even come down when asked if she wants to go for a walk (#1 favourite thing in the world) or offered food (#2 favourite thing in the world). He has even tried to put her collar and leash on while she's upstairs, so that she understands he really means he wants to take her for a walk, and she will just lay there and stare at him, refusing to budge. The only thing that ever works is pouring her dog food into her dish, which brings her running downstairs at top speed, at which point he can slip on her collar and leash and take her outside for a walk. On her walks with him, she is completely fine.

He has never hit her. He offers her food, treats, cuddles, pets, and play very often, but she never warms up to him unless I'm in the room. How can we get her to like him more? I know the abuse in the past is the key factor here, but it's been over three years since that's happened at least, and my dad also used to live in this house, so surely she understands by now that men are not all bad. She even approaches men she doesn't know who visit our home, or men we encounter on walks, albeit carefully.

Thanks for any suggestions!

678,"[Breeds] DNA test results in for my ""2 year old lab mix""",dogs,t3_aa1q0c,5,False,False,aa1q0c,"I adopted Waffle about 6 weeks ago and instantly wanted to be sure of his breed background so I could have some more guidance on how to approach training. I thought he was around two years old but learned quickly he is MUCH younger-- right around one year old probably, so still has a lot of puppy behavior.

I have been frustrated that he seems somewhat disinterested in treats and learning new commands. I haven't dealt with a dog before that just doesn't seem to connect the ask with the reward. He knows sit very well but even after 6 weeks needs a gentle reminder that I'm asking him to do something. I've been saying ""potty"" and trying to give treats every time he goes to the bathroom outside and yet still he does it on his own time. [Well I think his surprising DNA results help explain some of that...](https://imgur.com/a/SgLWw4X)

679,[Discussion] To Samoyed owners in this subreddit or anyone who’s owned both A Siberian and a Samoyed.,dogs,t3_aa2363,0,False,False,aa2363,"What are Samoyeds like compared to Siberians? I own a 2 year old Siberian and he’s great. We run twice a day 3k each time, but I know one day he won’t need that much running, so the idea is in the future to get a second dog to keep up with my daily exercise. Are Samoyeds as good running dogs? Same energy? Less? More? I really have a soft spot for Northern dogs. "
680,[breeds] Help me choose a dog please!,dogs,t3_aa1wke,1,False,False,aa1wke,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* This will be the first dog I own by myself. I grew up with dogs, though.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* I prefer to rescue a dog

 3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* I live in an apartment, so I need something that is fine with not having too much space. However, I go hiking a lot and I live in an area that has good parks, so I want something that will be able to keep up on a hike (or is at least easy to carry if it gets tired and I have to carry it).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* I would like something smaller since I live in an apartment. I've only ever had border collies, so I would be comfortable with something similar to that, but a border collie's energy level and need for stimulation will not fit my lifestyle at this time. I've also spent time around golden retrievers, but I worry that those would be too big for my current lifestyle.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* The most important thing is being good with people and other dogs and being a good walker. I would also like to teach the dog to do tricks, but that's not very important.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* Several hours a day. I am gone for work about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so I worry the dog would not get enough interaction, but besides that I will be able to interact with the dog almost all the time.  

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* I plan on walking the dog for at least an hour every day. I don't think there is a dog park in my area, but there are a lot of dogs around, so it will get plenty of interaction with other dogs and people.  

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I am open to brushing and basic grooming at home. If the dog needs an actual haircut beyond basic trimming, I will take it to a groomer, but I would prefer to keep this to a few times a year rather than a monthly trip to the groomer. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Something smaller that can live in an apartment. I believe most apartments in my area have a 50 lbs limit for dogs, so something smaller than that. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* I prefer a minimum on all three. A quieter dog would be ideal since I live in an apartment.  

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* I would like a dog that can learn to handle itself off-leash so I don't have to worry about what it may do, but I do not intend to let my dog off-leash in an unfenced area.  

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* I would like a snuggly dog.  

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* I would like an eager-to-please dog.  

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I would like a dog that will alert me to someone entering our home, but doesn't go crazy with barking and jumping.  

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No. Because of the area I live in and living in an apartment, a dog-aggressive dog is not an option. There are other dogs in my building, so the dog will at some point encounter another dog in the elevator. It must be able to behave with other dogs and people in an elevator.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* Chewing on things  

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* About 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* I am the only person in the household, so the dog will be my responsibility.  

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* I may at some point get a cat.  

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* No, but there are children in my neighborhood, so I would like to teach the dog how to interact with children.  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I currently rent. I believe the weight restriction is 50 lbs and under.  

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* I live in Wisconsin. I am not sure about laws banning specific breeds in my area, but I am not interested in controversial breeds, such as pitbulls, because I rent and they would limit my housing options.  

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* The temperature in Wisconsin fluctuates a lot. A summer day is usually around 80F, but can get into the 90s. A winter day is around 20F, but can get well below zero.  

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* I travel a lot throughout the state, so the dog will also be traveling a lot. I need something that will be good with car rides. A typical long car ride will be 1-4 hours a few times a month. There will be plenty of opportunities to stop and let the dog out, so it won't be 4 hours straight in the car.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  \* Is there a dog that is even right for my lifestyle? I worry about leaving it home for 8 hours while I'm at work. "
681,[Vent] People need to stop putting their hands on random strangers' dogs in public places without asking. ESPECIALLY when I'm actively training the dog.,dogs,t3_a9vthd,19,False,False,a9vthd,"Some people disagree with me, but I'm of the opinion that dogs don't really like being pet on the head.  I know that about 2/3 of the dogs I've had in my life (over a dozen) would much prefer a chest pat.

Then we amp that up by introducing the people who don't ask permission to pet a stranger's dog and just assume that because the dog looked their way and isn't growling that touching it is okay.  And then they always go for the head.

Then we amp that up because a lot of these people have children.  Some of these children get to the dogs before the parents do and immediately man-handle them whilst squealing and screaming.  This could be *extremely* dangerous and result in a dog being put down for being ""dangerous"" or ""aggressive"" when he was actually unexpectedly tackled from behind by two rambunctious children.

Then...  We amp *that* up by throwing my training into the mix.  I cannot tell you how many times a week my training sessions get fucked up by random folks or their kids coming up behind me then touching the dog as I'm working with it.  I really can't stand it when they *call the dog to jump up on them.*  I can catch them if they're coming from the sides or in front of me, but when I'm working the dogs and their owners and they come up from behind, I usually don't see them until there's a hand near the dog's face.

It pisses these folks off when I tell them not to touch the dog because it's in training.  I really want to ask them how they'd feel if someone just ran up behind their child and picked her/him up and gave it a kiss on the cheek?  And that's still not incorporating the risk of freaking out a skittish dog and causing it to snarl or bite.  People usually don't bite, even when they're freaked out...

I can't believe this isn't common courtesy knowledge.  Maybe it's because I grew up around dogs and have worked with them for seven years...  But it's still unbelievable to me."
682,[Help] Carsickness for Dogs,dogs,t3_aa1wfa,4,False,False,aa1wfa,"So I adopted my pup about a month ago. Everything is going great, he’s an awesome dog. We really lucked out on him. Plays well with dogs, kids, etc. 

My roommates and I are going on a road trip to a buddy’s cabin this weekend for New Years. I had a bunch of family over this past weekend and he did really well, so we’ve decided to take him with us, instead of leaving him at home. 

Every time he gets in the car, his whole demeanor changes. He’s all of the sudden really calm, drooling a ton, sometimes throws up, sometimes his breathing gets shallow. All the signs of anxiety and needing the throw up. I already went to one vet and they weren’t any help. I’m going to be taking him to another vet at the start of the year for a wellness exam, and to address any issues we’re having, once we get to know normal a little better. 

The car ride is 3 1/2 hours. He doesn’t seem to want to chew during car rides, he just seems to accept that he’s going to throw up. We have tried on the floor in the backseat, on the backseat, and in the front seat. It doesn’t seem to make a difference. Time also doesn’t seem to matter. I took him on an hour car ride once, he was GREAT. Last week I took him 20 minutes away and he puked on the way home. 

Any tips or tricks that you’ve tried that help, please let me know. "

I understand the general feeding, b12-injections, and constant vigilance. I still have a lot to learn about the condition, but overall feel pretty prepared. I do, however, have one area of concern. How am I supposed to train her without giving her treats? I have an Aussie/GSD that I've had a lot of success training using a clicker and high value treats, but can't figure out how to translate that for a dog that (probably?) can't have treats."
684,[Help] Older rescue seems miserably bored but won't play,dogs,t3_aa0x3m,8,False,False,aa0x3m,"Hello all! Haven't posted on reddit in years so hoping this is all within this subs rules...

&amp;#x200B;

I have a +/- 10 year old rescue brussels griffon, who my husband rescued before we met and it was estimated he was around 5 at that time. We have speculated that he was very likely a stud, as his features are purebred, he was not fixed (at \~5yo) when he was found, he has a clearly abusive history/PTSD, and he didn't know how to use stairs, a harness, or act like a ""dog"" (barely still does).

&amp;#x200B;

He's come A LONG LONG way and we're so proud of him, but now that he's happier and healthier, he's much spunkier and seems to be needing something that we cannot figure out  / don't know how to give him.

&amp;#x200B;

An attempt at a long-story-short: he never learned how to play and won't play, but is bored to death all of the time it seems like. He doesn't care about toys (but also doesn't have enough teeth to use them anyway) and is not really smart enough (sorry little guy) to fetch or anything of the like. He's food-motivated but only for meals (kongs w/ peanut butter, etc, have failed and his face is too flat for food mazes, he'd just starve.... ), and leaving him with food-motivated toys only results in him pooping or peeing on them (he's only housebroken when you're home... joys of a rescue). We don't have a yard right now and are not allowed to get another dog in our place... we've been looking to move FOR his sake specifically, but it's been unrealistic so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly, the only way we've ever been able to figure out he likes to ""play"" is for him to stand vaguely out of reach from you and bark. That's it. He doesn't/won't stray from us at off-leash parks and he doesn't care at all about other dogs. He's not smart enough (or simply not interested enough) in doing anything like nose-training (and tbh I'm not sure his senses are good enough for anything like that either). Sadly we can't afford doggie daycare and don't have any friends with dogs to go on dates with, and no friends who can stop by to get some energy out who are available or nearby....

&amp;#x200B;

He's often sighing heavily and constantly fidgeting (not in pain, had that checked out....) and is very dramatic during the night standing up and collapsing down onto the hardwoods when people are trying so sleep, clearly indicating he is antsy. All I can think of is to just walk/run him harder but he's fickle about that (particularly in inclement weather, in seattle), and that's not very ""fun"" either really.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just wondering/hoping anyone might have any behavioral insight or suggestions who know more about this than we do? Poor guy seems miserable and giving scritches/pets/love is just not cutting it. Thank you so much!!

685,[Help] Neverending allergies and concurrent infections; our pup is suffering.,dogs,t3_aa1of8,15,False,False,aa1of8,"\[Help\]  My husband and I rescued my dog, an AmStaff, 1.5 years ago and he's currently 3.5 years old.  He had red paws and itchiness when we first got him, which was diagnosed as allergies by our first, local vet.  This began our neverending battle with allergic reactions and skin infections. (He turns tomato red, licks constantly, has broken skin w/ pustules at times, and often carries concurrent infections. Sometimes I wonder if the skin infection is truly a by-product of the allergic reactions or if he has an ongoing infection separately and in addition to his allergies.) The thing is, his issues have gotten exponentially worse with time.  Last winter he was fairly decent, but this winter he is miserable without some combination of ketoconazole (antifungal), apoquel, and cephalexin (antibiotic) and, sometimes, even when medicated he is still bright red and absolutely miserable.  The vets claim it's because he's allergic to non-seasonal triggers (mold, food) but that doesn't seem plausible to me, because then he would have reacted similarly last year, no? We've seen 4 vets and they all give the same advice (more drugs, more drugs, more drugs) but I've had my own experiences with constant antibiotic/medication use and know first-hand the repercussions.  I cringe every time I give him his medicine at this point and am emotionally exhausted from seeing him suffer and feeling powerless to help. We've had him allergy-tested and he's allergic to so much that I feel like he might have immune confusion, histamine intolerance and/or mast cell activation disorder; vets don't seem to want to entertain that possibility though. Here's a list of what we've tried and/or are currently trying:

* Specialized diet (removed offending foods; fed only freeze-dried and frozen raw)
* Allergy-testing (allergic to many proteins and peas, along with grasses, trees, weeds, and some molds)
* Low-dose immunotherapy shots and sublinguals (started with shots - total nightmare, so switched to sublinguals; over-reacted to the triggers so took him off it)
* Apoquel  (as needed; makes him lethargic and cuts allergic response in half)
* Antibiotics (specifically cephalexin, aka keflex; so many rounds I can't count)
* Ketoconazole (antifungal; daily - absolutely terrible for his liver)
* Medicated shampoos (once weekly; seems to temporarily kill bacteria and yeast but also irritates his already damaged skin)
* Non-histamine producing probiotics (daily)
* S. Boulardii probiotic when not taking Ketoconazole to see if that would reduce yeast issues (didn't notice a difference)
* Digestive enzymes (daily)
* Immune support supplement ([Thorne's Immugen](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/immugen-reg) for dogs)
* Kidney glandular supplements (for DAO supplementation to reduce histamine; no noticeable improvement)
* [Histoplex supplement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073G7N2G5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) by Biotics Research (no noticeable difference)
* Betadine spray and liquid betadine for his skin (seems to help but it stings and he hates it)
* Quercetin w/ Bromelain (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Benadryl and Quercetin (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Pollock Oil (anti-inflammatory; improvement in coat and skin but not irritation/reaction)
* CBD oil for inflammation and discomfort (just started)
* Redonyl Ultra (just started; contains PEA and omegas; hoping it stabilizes mast cells and helps his skin)

I'm sure I'm missing something but this is where we're at.  Any help at all would be much appreciated.  We're so desperate at this point. :-(   Thanks, everyone.

686,[HELP] Dog suddenly behaving strange around 10 month old baby... unsure what to think.,dogs,t3_aa1m80,5,False,False,aa1m80,"Our 7 year old terrier mix has always been super sweet with our new addition - kept his distance most of the time but would come by with the occasional lick and tail wag, and would lay in her room as I put her down for a nap. Baby's now nearly 10 months and crawling and walking with a push toy like crazy, and suddenly I have a weird feeling about his behavior towards her. He follows her around when she's walking and gets up in her face to lick her and if I call him to sit on the couch and leave her alone he watches her like a hawk. I can't tell if it's just cute protectiveness or if I should be worried that her new mobility is causing him to, I dunno, feel more dominant? He's also been more clingy with me, following me around the house and sitting next to me all the time. Perhaps the two are related... some sort of newfound jealousy?

I suppose I should be 100% transparent and admit he's had aggression issues before with other dogs and strangers (mostly mailmen). We've been extra super cautious with the two of them because of his history, and as of just a couple days ago he's never displayed any sort of worrisome behaviors towards the baby ( I wonder if I'm being paranoid because of past issues?)

Are there any behaviors in particular I should keep an eye out for? I NEVER allow them to be alone together of course, but everything I search about ""issues with dogs licking baby's face"" seems to be about germs whereas I'm more concerned about him becoming aggressive towards her.

Any insight is appreciated."
687,[Breeds] What breeds would be right for me?,dogs,t3_aa1kjj,1,False,False,aa1kjj,"Hi r/dogs! I am currently a grad student and could not take care of a doggo right now. Being a (good) dog owner is definitely a goal in my life so I wanted to be a bit proactive now, and look into what companion would be best for me in 2-3 years..

**Introduction**

 * *Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?* 

Yes! I have no experience.

* *Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?*

 I would prefer going through a reputable breeder, especially since I might be interested in showing my dog.

* *Describe your ideal dog.* 

I would like my dog to be my companion. They would be fairly easily trained and more on the quiet side. I'd like them to be playful without being overly excited.

* *What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?* 

I live in a small apartment so toy breeds are definitely what I am looking into. Most of my family is in Europe and I like that I could bring my dog with me in the cabin when flying (I think the max. weight is 16lbs?). I was interested in long-coated Chihuahuas especially. I loved the look of toy Eskies but I hear they love to bark, which my neighbours would never forgive me for, same for Pomeranians. I also liked Italian Greyhounds. In any case I am open to suggestions!

* *What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?* 

Definitely basic obedience. Like I mentioned, if they can, I think it might be fun to go to dog shows - I really like the idea of my dog and I having our own special activity. Later on I might be interested in fostering seeing-eye dogs in training, so a dog that can get along with other dogs would be ideal.

**Care Commitments**

*  *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*  

I don't have an clear idea of what my dog would need in terms of training, but I thought I would be interacting with him pretty much constantly when at home.


*  *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?* 

I would like a total of 90 minutes/day split into maybe 2-3 walks, or smaller walks + going to the dog park. I also want my dog to either go to daycare during workdays, or at least be visited my a walker once a day.

*  *How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?* 

I am open to it completely, I hope my dog can be too! I would rather avoid going to a professional and save money that way.

**Personal Preferences**

  *  *What size dog are you looking for?* 

A mini one! Definitely toy or a small breed.

*  *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?* 

Medium shedding, although these are things can be dealt with. I am much less open to barking, so minimal barking.

* *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?* 

Not very. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

  *  *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?* 

Very much a snuggly one, otherwise I'd get a cat XD. I do worry about separation anxiety though..

  *  *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?* 

 Since I am a beginner, I think an eager-to-please dog would be easier for me, although there are limits - didn't someone post about their dog pooing to please them?? XD Yeah, I'd rather not, thanks dog.

  *  *How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?* 

By coming to me first I guess? With some curiosity but not bother visitors.

 * *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?* 

No. I don't know what I could do if my dog were aggressive in daycare for example..

  *  *Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?* 

Barking is the big one, I guess things like puppy biting and walking on a leash can be taught or addressed so I can't think of anything else.

**Lifestyle**

  * *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?* 

I am very much looking for remote positions but I will most probably work 9-5 so doggo would be left alone 4 hours before being walked, and 4 hours before I come home. I am looking into daycares.

  *  *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?* I will be the sole caretaker of the dog.

  *  *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?* 

I want to foster seeing-eye puppies in the future, or at least get other dogs.

 *  *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?* No.

  *  *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?* 

Yes, I rent. There are no specific restrictions but the dog should be well-behaved. I think having an obedience certificate might be an asset but that is just my opinion. In the future, if the gods smile upon me and I am able to ever afford a house, you bet I'd like big dogs.

  *  *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?* 

I am currently in Montreal, Canada, but I may move upon graduation. The city currently taxes pitbull owners.

  *  *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?* 

Summer: 25-28 Celsius or 77-82 Fahrenheit although climate change is hitting us hard and we had weeks at 35-42°C or 95-107°F. Winter: 0°C to - 20°C or 32°F to -4°F

**Additional Information and Questions**

  *  *Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.* I don't have a car, and don't plan on getting one. 

   * * Feel free to ask any questions below.*
I would like to know how much daycare is costing you guys, or if you have tips on finding reputable breeders and dog walkers.. I am curious to hear all your experiences and feedback! Thanks for reading all of this!

For the past couple of days, he doesn't eat much, barely drinks water, can't stand up or move on his own (he has been very unsteady on his feet for the past 4-5 months or so, but he was able to at least walk) and doesn't really react when we call his name. Nevertheless, he still barks semi-regularly and responds when we pet him. 

Although he doesn't explicitly express it by whimpering or anything like that, I think that he is in deep pain due to his condition (I've read that bone cancer can be extremely painful) and am looking for more information on whether the lameness and tiredness he is expressing is tied to his feeling unwell or his pain.

691,[Breeds] Am I a stupid idiot for wanting a German Sheperd as my first dog post-phobia?,dogs,t3_aa2isp,10,False,False,aa2isp,"Hey all,

So 2016 - 2018 was the two-year period where I kicked my phobia of dog's ass - note, I didn't kick the ass of any dogs during this period, that would be awful - and now I'm at the point where I can confidently be around dogs and it's like I'm not even around em. I've been looking into dogs, and I think a German Sheperd would be a good choice.

Here are some facts that might be helpful for you guys:

I'm 18, but I won't be going to college (called University here in the UK) for a good two years, maybe even three, and all I'm doing is my post-high school study called A levels. This means that I have a lot of time to devote to dog walking, training, all that.

I am financially stable as I saved a lot of money from when I wasn't in education and I receive a monthly sum anyways. This means that I am certainly not unable to provide for the dog.

I have a lot of space - I live in a three bedroom house with a garden, and one of the bedrooms is unused, as well as the dining room. 

I hear that German Sheperds are quite clingy and love to be around family, which I think would be a lot of fun as I can 100% provide the time commitments (practically) all year around. If I was to get a GS, I would choose my University accomondation accordingly; I want to make it clear to you guys that I am fully committed to raising the dog!

EDIT: I'd like to point out that I just realised that I have a very active lifestyle that might really benefit a GS - I follow a military routine (long story, not in the Army atm but I really enjoyed the training haha), this includes sprinting on some days, running every day; generally good cardio stuff that (I'm pretty sure) the dog would enjoy.

I don't live with babies or small children. I live with my dad who is a warehouse worker who is constantly active, and my brother who isn't around too much.

QUESTIONAIRRE:

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Zero dog experience, but I love the buggers now that I got over the phobia. First dog, but not the first dog in the family - my dad had a dog growing up.


2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?


* No preference.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.


* Loyal, physical enough that I can have fun with it when I go out on runs and the like, protective.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* GS, they look adorable and I would like a tough yet loving dog. They seem very loyal too.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Guard-type stuff, but I may be able to get in touch with my friend who is a K9 trainer in the Army (the lucky git)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Literally as much as I need. I'm out monday-friday from 9AM to 5PM, but the evening is the dogs, and so is the weekend. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* See my main post, I do a lot of cardio and strength exercises outdoors and this seems like perfect GS territory.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Totally open to that! We have HEPA air filters at my house that are rated for dogs so I don't even need to worry about annoying hairs, and no one has allergies either :)

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

*Medium - big. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*Infinite, haha. I think it goes with the territory of owning a GS.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*Not important, but if I had to do that I wouldn't mind!

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

*Is there such a thing as a mixture of both? I'd lead more toward snuggly though.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

*Eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

*Wouldn't mind them making noise when someone knocks on the door. We rarely get visitors but it would be nice if they were friendly with them up to a certain level.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*Yep!

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
Nothing that comes to mind as long as it isn't biting me a lot haha

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

*9 AM to 5PM when I'm at college, 9 AM to 3PM on Tuesdays. Family will be in but they have less dog experience.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

*Family are indifferent, but they'd feed the dog if needed.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*I mean, I might get a goldfish or something at some point, but no other four-legged friends!

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

*No. Very, very rarely - if ever.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

*No restrictions on dogs where I live, and I'll actually cater renting my Uni dwellings around the dog.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*UK, and the only restrictions are on the ""killer breeds"" that are bred to be violent; GS doesn't count.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*Summer days - Highs of 22 degrees celsius and lows of 11. Roughly 70 deg fahrenheit high and 51 degree low.

*Winter days - Really depends as the UK has a weird climate. Lows of -1 C (30 F) and highs of 7 or 8 (45 degrees) depending on the day. Lots and lots of rain though."
692,[Help] my dog starts barking randomly in the morning,dogs,t3_aa2hmk,8,False,False,aa2hmk,"For the past 2 to 3 weeks, my dog starts randomly barking in the early morning, 5 AM, 6 or 7 usually, don't know what causes it, but it's driving my parents around the bend, what can be done to get him to stop? My parents have been talking about giving him away and I don't want to lose him."
693,[Help] Housemates beginning to not get along.,dogs,t3_a9zvzr,11,False,False,a9zvzr,"First post here, but I'm stumped as to how to advise my parents on their dogs. Sorry if I'm a little disjointed or if the formatting is off, there's a bit to unpack here. 

   A little bit of background: They have two dogs (and one cat). Both dogs are the same breed (American Bulldog) and sex (female), but differ in age. The older dog is around 7, the younger dog is nearing 2. Older Dog came from a shady breeder as the runt and we suspect she was abused before we got her, although it doesn't seem to affect her regarding aggression towards people or other dogs. She plays well with others and is very much a people pleaser. 

   Younger dog on the other hand, is a little...off. She came from much better beginnings than older dog, but has ended up with a mild form of congenital ataxia. Whereas older dog was a very easy to train dog, younger dog is slow to pick up commands and very hardheaded. Younger dog also is very easily scared, but will respond with aggression. (Example: Her and older dog on a play date with another dog, Younger dog took a potshot she almost regretted but Older Dog stepped in and defended her until people came to break them up.)

&amp;#x200B;

We've been noticing a disturbing trend between the two dogs though. Younger dog is starting to pick fights with the older dog. Older dog will do her best to try to prevent a fight, but Younger dog is so bullheaded that she keeps on until Older Dog can't take it anymore. Fights will erupt (all instigated by the younger dog) over affection, food, toys, and occasionally an unknown stimulus. Older dog will give younger dog a wide berth because she doesn't want to fight (doesn't like making my mom or dad upset) and will avoid as much as she can until she can't. 

Usually when a fight erupts it's after Younger Dog stares down Older Dog (with Older Dog avoiding looking at her). Younger Dog will take a potshot, and then it's on. Older Dog, despite being avoidant, will throw down when she has to. The fight I witnessed happened behind me after I gave older dog some attention. Younger dog stared down and took her shot, tried to take older dog down and got grounded by Older Dog. Older dog will not clamp down to draw blood, but will pin Younger dog down by the throat until she stops fighting. However, the second Older Dog releases, Younger dog is right back up snapping and snarling until Older Dog puts her down again. 

This is different from their play fights. I feel this is a challenge situation over resources (including affection). But we don't know what to do about it. I'm not so worried about having to break them up because for now fights are only occurring when people are home. My concern is what will happen if a fight breaks out and nobody is home. I don't think Younger Dog will stop. I think she'll keep on and keep on until both of them are tired or one of them wins. And I feel bad for the older dog as well. She shouldn't be slinking around the house hiding and trying to avoid a fight from the younger dog because she was there first. My Mom has thought about rehoming the Younger Dog, but is worried that with her ataxia (mild as it is, she's just forever going to be a little clumsy like a puppy with paws too big for their legs) rehoming will be hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to tell them. I did tell mom it wouldn't be as hard as she thinks to rehome for such a mild neurological issue, but I understand that she would rather find a way to solve the issue in the house. All issues aside, Younger dog can be incredibly sweet. None of us like how it's affecting Older dog though, because this was her home first. 

Is there anyone else that has had experience with this issue? What did you do to remedy it? Or is rehoming the only answer?

701,"[Fluff] I accidentally left the front door open and all my pets are so good, they just stayed inside (thank goodness)!",dogs,t3_a9uqbm,6,False,False,a9uqbm,"So I'm not even sure how that happened. I remember closing and locking the door, but clearly I must not have. I worked from home today and took the dogs out to go potty after I finished. Then we came back in and I thought I closed and locked the door. I know for sure I at least closed it, because I walked into the kitchen and then into the bedroom. I would have seen the opened door and would have recognized that wasn't right if it was opened when I walked to the bedroom. I'm not even sure how it was opened... None of my pets can reach the handle. Maybe I just didn't close it well and someone opened it? Who knows...

Anyway, none of my pets left. Including the cat! My youngest has just figured out on his own that you always stay in the yard. It's probably cause I'd scold him when he'd try to walk out and he hates being scolded. Our driveway is open because the gate broke, it's $6k to replace everything, and apparently you need a permit for literally everything.  Even our  newest dog stayed and we've only had him for a couple months at this point. 

The door was open for over an hour. I didn't even realize it! It really could have been dangerous but all my boys were so good and I'm so thankful. "
702,[HELP] My dog gets seizures.,dogs,t3_aa2j2u,0,False,False,aa2j2u,"My 1 year old Maltese/Poodle mix was born with this mysterious condition where he gets seizures 2 to 5 times a week.

He's had plenty of tests done (liver ultrasound, Brain MRI, spinal tap, Xrays, and blood work.) and everything comes out normal. His neurologist and his vet cannot find a solid answer as to why he keeps getting them. Right now I have him on Diazepam and Phenobarbital but it's not working much. I am also giving him CBD oil 240mg but considering getting 1000 mg from the vet's office. I am honestly running out of options and not to mentioned the expense this has taken on me.

704,[Help] My senior dog is having a very bad post seizure recovery and is extremely hungry,dogs,t3_aa22bc,1,False,False,aa22bc,"My 13 year old pug started having seizures when she was around 9, they lasted about 30 seconds and she was perfectly normal right after. 

Two months ago she started having grand mal seizures that lasted about 3 minutes and were quite violent with a recover period of about 2-3 hours of disorientation. I started her on CBD oil and didn't have a seizure for a month. I switched to a pet specific one and I think the dosage was lower and I didn't realize I was only giving her 2.5mg instead of 5mg (20lb dog). She started having seizures again. Had 4 in one day and no amount of CBD seemed to help so I brought her to the emerg vet who gave me phenobarbital and gabapentin.

This was 24 hours ago and her seizures have stopped but her recovery phase is much much worse. She's been just screaming for the past 20 hours and her back legs barely work now. She's ravenously hungry, which I've read is fairly normal post seizure. But I think the screaming is from how hungry she is. I went to my regular vet to get something to sedate her because this dog usually sleeps 15 hours a day but has had maybe 4 hours of sleep. She was given valium and it helped her sleep for maybe 2 hours before she woke up and started screaming again. Food is the only thing that calms her down and she eats it like she's been starved. When I touch her, she sniffs my hand to see if I have food and will nibble a bit on anything around her mouth.

I'm worried it's all neurological and no amount of food with satiate her. I don't want to over feed her but I wonder how much can I give. After the first few seizures, she was running around constantly. 

I just want her to get some rest have to have the screaming stop. Has anyone had a similar experience?

TL;DR Dog had 4 bad seizures in one day. Is on phenobarbital and valium for it now and the seizures have stopped but she's screaming constantly and I think it's from hunger. Is it safe to over feed her or should I be doing something else to sooth her?"
705,[Help] Talking to someone about their aggressive dog.,dogs,t3_aa1xzz,3,False,False,aa1xzz,"I have another post going in r/relationships that describes the issue in more detail, but to sum it up, my brother has a dog with bad fear-aggression and it frequently bites other people. I'm wondering if there's any advice from the dog owner's perspective that I could give to him.

To tell you some more about the dog's background:

Sadie is about 8 years old and is some kind of chihuahua-terrier mix, she's about 25 lbs. He and his wife adopted her about 6 years ago and at adoption time, she already came with her various behavior problems. These include excessive barking, resource guarding, leash reactivity and fear-aggression that results in bites intended to injure others. Sadie does not growl, snap or give any other obvious warning signs before she attacks.

My brother's wife is the root problem, in my opinion, because Sadie is extremely protective of her. Most of the bites are directed at people or animals who come too close to the wife for Sadie's comfort. The wife does most of the feeding, walking, etc. and is constantly giving Sadie treats, comforting her when she's scared, talking to her when she barks, and holding her when she is acting afraid or aggressive.

Things they've tried for Sadie:

* Hired a trainer - they had a few sessions with a trainer and saw some improvement with Sadie. The trainer then said that Sadie has some serious behavior problems and they should strongly consider bringing her to a veterinary behaviorist for further treatment. Wife fired the trainer after this.
* Dog-dog socialization - Sadie is aggressive to other dogs so she can't go to the dog park and she can't pack-walk. She has no dog friends.
* Anti-bark collar - They ordered one and never took it out of the box.
* Muzzle (the velcro style, not basket style) - They ordered one and never took it out of the box.
* Crate - They ordered one and set it up but Sadie doesn't go in it.

Throughout the years I've also mentioned some things like trying a training book or some videos, consulting with another trainer again, other tips on behavior modification etc. and the wife shuts it down every time, saying ""That kind of stuff doesn't work for Sadie."" I know the wife is often frustrated with Sadie's behavior, in particular the non-stop barking, but she is apparently not willing to try anything different.

My question for dog owners is in two parts:

* Question 1, is there any hope to try training a dog like this? It's gone on for years so I'm not sure any change can really be made at this point, and maybe all we can do is just insist that Sadie stay home and away from others.
* Question 2, if someone ever spoke to you about your dog's behavior, what worked in that case? What kind of statements made sense and what kind of statements threw you off?

**TL,DR: Brother and his wife have an aggressive dog that bites, I need to talk to them about this, looking for perspective from other dog owners on how they might prefer to receive feedback about their dog's behavior from others.**"
706,[Help] The Worst Start to Owning a Puppy Ive Ever Had (on the verge of a breakdown).,dogs,t3_aa1qnt,11,False,False,aa1qnt,"I've always grown up owning dogs. I firmly believe man should grow with a dog to some extent. I recently became a licensed nurse, started making more, and finally got to a point where I could own a dog. A puppy even, if I made the needed adjustments. I work out as much as I can throughout the week, so the dog could get plenty of exercise under my care. Seriously I had thought of all the necessary provisions, dog sitters, food, researched breeds, kept tabs on the market, etc. I had it all planned out. Even though I work night shift mostly, I could make it work. I refuse to believe that I can't do this just because I'm single living in a 2bed apartment. And when he gets older, I can always drop him off at my mom's omw to work bc she has a huge backyard and that would be good for him to stretch his legs during the hours I work.

My sister, who lives in Denver, finds a puppy she wants out in the state I live. She asks me to get it for her and she will venmo me the money. It's a Boston terrier pup. Cute Lil thing, but he adjusted extremely well. I was able to play with the pup, attempted to train here and there, and even had a dog sitter for it. Now, the breeder I'm buying from fails to mention he will be out the day I wanna buy the dog, so now I'm pressed to buy sooner. I buy him yesterday early morning thinking I'm gonna have all day and night with the pups and then I'd have a dog sitter for the next day. His name is Roy and he's a border collie.

11:00pm rolls around last night (12/26/18) and I get a call from my work, ""where are you? You're supposed to be here."" Apparently, my schedule was changed without my knowing. Now I'm in full blown panic mode. What the hell do I do now? I start calling ppl up left n right, hitting up dog sitters via Rover - nothing. I tell my date that I had earlier that day (I didn't leave the two pups alone for more than an hour btw) my situation, not realizing she would volunteer to help. So she says she will take care of them for the night at her place. Not ideal, but I can't deny that opportunity. So I do this. Now I have them back, trying to get some sleep before I have to work a freaking double from 3pm to 7am which was also scheduled without my knowing. Now I'm on the verge of a complete breakdown. I haven't been able to give Roy a good couple of days all bc of some bs with work and I'm thinking this will dramatically affect him. I can't get him to use puppy pads and I wasn't able to introduce the crate to him in a positive way at all. Idk what to do and I feel like I'm overwhelmed and drowning. Like I'm genuinely about to cry and freak out bc I didn't plan on it being so rough for Roy. For the record, the Boston terrier is named Austin and he's been doing really well, but Roy isn't. I put them both in the same kennel (it's a large kennel) to see if it would help Roy but it doesn't. He is constantly freaking out like how I am right now lol. Idk if I'm going to be able to keep up. How fucked up is this situation and am I being too dramatic here? Should I call the breeder and send the puppy back bc I am on total freak out mode and suddenly feel like I cant do this anymore. Like Roy had such a bad first day that I feel I  can't even repair whatever trauma he may or may not have undergone moving around so much."

He’s a really cute dog so I get a lot of people who want to meet him and cuddle with him. I’ve taken him to the vet twice, payed 40$ for the vet to just flip his skin back over his dick.  Which was pointless because when we got home it was out again! I cut the hairs around his dick Incase they were getting in the way of him pulling it back in. That maybe him licking himself was to try and lubreacte it or something. I tell him to stop every time I see him licking himself and then don’t make eye contact.

712,[Help] Is it ever too late to train a dog not to bark?,dogs,t3_aa18zi,3,False,False,aa18zi,"Hello!

My 2,5 year old dog (terrier/pinscher mix) barks a lot, especially outside at other dogs and I am overchallenged with it. I am suffering from social anxiety and the looks people give you when your dog is barking is really too much for me and I don't like it when other people make a mean comment regarding my dog, since I truly love her and of course don't want anyone to insult her. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory: My mom and I got the dog together but she mostly had her and was basically the ""pack leader"". Our girl was always way more quiet when I had her and when she barked my mother only rant at her until she stopped. Over the years it got more and more out of control and we got a muzzle which I kept using when she barked and it was really a help. My mother wasn't using it though because ""she looked so awful"" with it. We often kept fighting about it but she never really used it. 

Well now my mom isn't there anymore (not dead) and I have the dog alone and she is seeing me as her leader now. While she isn't barking much at home, she basically always barks at other dogs outside. At home I can easily use the muzzle and I really see that it is helping, but outside it's different. When we see another dog I always try to change the street or something but sadly that's not always possible and honestly I rather want to solve the problem now and not just runaway from it. 

Now you're probably wondering why I don't use the muzzle outside - my dog isn't walking when she wears it. At home she is moving a little bit like getting on the bed and walking towards me but if we are outside she doesn't even walk if I pull the leash a bit. She is just standing there and I'd basically had to drag her behind me to get her going, but of course that's not the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be very thankful for any help and advice since it's taking a toll on my social anxiety and I'd really like my dog and me to have a good time outside."

Dogs that fit this description are gone within the day and rescues keep sticking their nose up at us. Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog. 

Our wishlist for a dog: prefer small but only needs to be under 120 lbs (apartment restriction), cannot be a pit, gsd, or husky, must get along with other dogs and people, energetic and athletic, between 1 to 4 years old,

Sorry for the wall of text. This started as a question and has kind of turned into a vent with hope for advice.

So my husband and I are looking at getting another dog. We are having serious issues with finding a compatible dog and I am wondering if we are just asking too much or if we are just not looking in the right places.

Background: We are both from the south but are in the North West. We are definitely having a problem getting use to a completely different culture surrounding dog adoption. We are use to having tons of good dogs looking for adoption for anywhere from $25 to $100. Here the cheapest county shelter is $250, private groups start at $500, and the dogs are gone within a day or two.

We have decided to get an adult dog from a shelter for the ease and to skip the terrible puppy  stage. I have only ever had a dog I raised from puppyhood. My husband has never had a puppy and got his dogs as adults, but they also only had one dog at a time and the dogs were outdoor only dogs.

We have a 7 year old border collie mix who has lived with as many as 5 other dogs in a house and has never had any serious issues with any of them. She will never start fights, however, she won't run away when attacked either.

Problem: we have been looking at dogs since September and cannot seem to find a good match. We did adopt one dog in September but as soon as she became comfortable in the house it became apparent she was large dog/fear aggressive and would constantly attack our current dog (mostly over resources and proximity). This led to us returning her for fear that we end up having an ER visit or worse due to the fights (it got very close to needing an ER visit twice in the month we had her). It was a costly mistake as her adoption price was $575 and the rescue group black listed us because ""we didn't know how to handle dog with issues"". This rescue organization came highly recommend and they told us this dog ""didn't have an aggressive bone in her body"". They made no mention of issues before we adopted her but when I reached out to ask how to calm her down and get her more relaxed they told me ""she just needs time, she started fights when she first got here too"".

We decided to be more cautious, we have been more attuned to how our dog greets the other dog, how the rescue/shelter is organized, and really looking at the dog's personality. But so far we are always late and the dog is gone before we have made a decision on the dog.

We have also been avoided by a lot of rescues because we are young, in an apartment, and looking for a high energy dog. Our current dog is high energy and we really enjoy that energy level because we enjoy walking (walk a minimum of 2 30 minute walks a day), hiking, and are generally athletic people. I would also really like to get into dog sports. But the rescues always turn us to old, low energy dogs.I am really about to say let's save up and get a purebred puppy at this point even tho I hate the puppy phase.

Just in case you forgot (again sorry for the wall of text) the question is So are we asking too much? Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog.

714,[help] Is it possible my dog broke his nose?,dogs,t3_aa156v,2,False,False,aa156v,"Hey,

  I have two rat terriers and one was wrapped in a blanket and the other started barking so he jumped down with the blanket over his body and would up running straight into a wooden chest. I ran over and unwrapped him and he was sneezing really hard really fast and he nose was absolutely off center. It’s been a few minutes and the sneezing has mostly stopped, occasional sneeze or half sneeze/trying to kind of thing. His nose now appears straight and I can lightly move it around with no yelping or hard pulling away or anything. 

  Think he’s fine ? He really didn’t even hit the chest hard I think he just went nose first and he’s got a pointy snout "
715,[Help] Which breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_aa144t,2,False,False,aa144t,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It would be the first dog we own. I have an uncle that owned and trained several Rottweilers and German-Shepards. So I was often around dogs in my life. Also walked them and played with them etc.

My wife was also around dogs as a child but never owned one.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We would love to rescue a dog. However, depending on the breed we heard that one needs to be careful with rescue dogs. The uncle I mentioned above recommend me to not get a rescue dogs as ""you can get a lot of baggage you do not know about"".

Any additional advice from you would be very welcome.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

A companion that loves being around my wife an me. He should be able to spend time with either me or my wife without ""missing"" the other too much.

He should be be able to hang on the couch for some time but also love walks/hikes/jogging and should not have problems with other dogs or children. We are not looking for a guard dog. However, there are a lot of children and other dogs around our neighbourhood.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I always likes Labradors, however we might think that they might be too big for a first time dog. I hear a lot of recommendation for this one as a first time/family dog. I also have a thing for Welsh Corgis. I understand that they might be very active.

We both find Beagles could fit us very well.

My wife likes Dachshunds and other smaller breeds. She would prefer a dog that she can lift up if the situation requires it.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Walking along side us, fetch, sit, speak/quite. The usual I guess. Nothing too exotic I think.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1 hour should be possible every day. More on the weekends.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I think 30mins each day are possible. We both jog every other day. So the dog would come with us. On the off days we would go for walks or play fetch in the yard.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We would prefer a shorter coat. If necessary all grooming will be done for the dog. A professional would be used if totally necessary but is not preferred.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and Slobber can be handled a lot. The neighbours would probably prefer the barking to be at minimum. However, they also have dogs and they sometimes bark too.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

We would love to let the dog run free in safe area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly most of the time.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Is ""somewhere in between"" a possible answer? 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

As mentioned, we are not looking for a guard dog. Knocking at doors should preferably not be a problem. If someone enters the yard, it would be good if he barks.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Would be great if the dog does not like to eat shoes, cables or tv remotes. But hey...thats just something you have to deal with when owning a dog.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home about 90%. On the days that I would not be at home, my wife could take the dog to work with her. I neither works, the dog would stay in the yard for about 8 hours. However, I cannot imagine that happening very often. 

If we would be gone for longer, my parents can take care of the dog. They also have a big yard.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My wife loves dogs and wants one too. We would share the involvement 50/50.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not at the moment. We might be expecting our first child in 1-2 years.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We own a house with a yard in the suburbs. No intention of renting.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in Graz, Austria. No specific restrictions come to mind.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer 25 to 30 degrees celcius
Winter 5 to -10 degrees celcius

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We have a fenced yard that is about 120 square metres big.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

What do you guys think is the one thing that most newbies do not think about when getting a dog? We try to prepare as good as possible."
716,"[Discussion] Wow, kids be dumb. Parents need to do their job.",dogs,t3_a9pn7u,58,False,False,a9pn7u,"Christmas was interesting for our 3-month-old pup. He has met kids before when we take him to the park, but this week he met the family kids (ages 7-10). I thought they would be at least a little knowledgeable about how to behave with a dog because they all have their own. I definitely overestimated there.
 
The kids don't listen. The first thing they did was run screaming down the street towards me and the puppy. I held up my hand and yelled to stop and slow down. Kids continued and parents did nothing. 
 
Playing with my puppy involved chasing him, encouraging him to bite their hands and feet, backing him into corners, getting all up in his face... I tried so many times to stop the kids and explain that they needed to let pup get to know them, let him sniff them, etc and don't invade his personal space. I tried to teach them about his body language and when it means they should back off. They didn't adjust their behavior and I had to babysit.
 
Kids be dumb. One asked, ""How come he won't let me pet his belly?"" I'm like, ""How would you feel if someone you just met came up to you and rolled you onto your back to rub your belly?"" Didn't make the connection.
 
We went outside to walk pup after dinner. Kid comes with us. He's like, ""Are we gonna run him around soon? Cuz I'm getting bored."" I'm like, ""We're not out here to entertain you wtf?""
 
Most of my last two days have just been a stressful mess of me having to take my puppy away from the kids to protect him. Or getting discipliny with them because their parents are off having fun.
 
People kept asking me, why don't I take him off the leash inside? 1) because he is 3 months old and doesn't know how to stay alive and 2) the kids harass him.
 
I try to put pup down in his crate for naps and the kids come bursting in like ""NOOO why are you putting him in a cage??"" He's safe in there and it's naptime. How about someone put you in a cage."

The only problem is that she bites A LOT and it's really getting on my parents nerves.

Am I crazy to not want him to stay there anymore?,dogs,t3_aa01ll,11,False,False,aa01ll,"We have an 8 month old puppy and went away twice so far (both just an overnight trip). Our in-laws love him but dont worry about or accept the same risks as us. For instance they let him out freely in the back yard (fenced) which concerns me because he likes to eat EVERYTHING. They don’t even crate him because my mother IL says it’s cruel to see dogs in crates, even after explaining how it works. We’ve never used the crate for punishment and at home, he even voluntarily goes in at bed time.

After the two times he has spent the night there, he’s refused to eat food for about 2 days. Could this be a stress response in reaction to not being in the crate or off his routine?"

I have no intention of trying to tell you how to teach your kids, but as a warning. My Husky is very easy going and I wasn't necessarily worried when it did happen, but you might not be so lucky with another dog. I had both my dogs unleashed at an off leash park with no one around and I was about 15 ft away when my husky was doing his business. He likes a little privacy when he goes #2. Right in the middle of his dump a small child screams ""husky"" out of nowhere and runs directly for him. Before I could even get to him the child was already petting him and running off before I could even say a word. Luckily my shepherd isn't to keen on small children so she just avoids them by going the opposite direction. I understand dogs are the best thing when you're a child, but you never know what is going to happen. Next time they might not meet a well mannered pup who loves kids, next time they might accidentally surprise the dog and get nipped, next time they might get bitten badly. So please, for dog owners and parents alike, to avoid any sort of problem, please let your children know not to run up to a strange dog.

730,"[discussion] I think my friend is about to buy from a puppy mill, how can i best warn him?",dogs,t3_a9txaq,14,False,False,a9txaq,"Friend is looking for a puppy. He has his heart set on Australian Shepherds, and found one available nearby.

Some of the ""red flags"" I've picked up talking to him:

 * They're breeding ""mini"" Australian Shepherds. That alone put me on alert, at least.
 * I'm aware Australian Shepherds are a popular breed at the moment and fairly susceptible to this kind of thing to start with.
 * ""Breeder"" seems to only have one or a few pairs of dogs that they repeatedly breed, all parents live with the breeder both moms and dads.
 * hip/knee checks are limited to ""my local vet says the parents are good"" and I'm unsure about eye testing - all three are recommended by akc for Aussies.
 * Breeder has lied to him about what to expect from the breed. They told him a mini Australian Shepherd will be a ""great apartment dog"" and only need a short daily walk for exercise and no mention of mental stimulation at all. I'm not worried about his ability to exercise the dog, he's a fairly active guy, but intentionally misinforming your pup's new parent rubs me the wrong way.
 * He's having difficulty getting them to commit to a home visit for the puppies, so he can see them prior to pickup.
 * No wait list, no interview, no meeting. He saw an add, said ""do you have a puppy for me"" and they said yes.
 * The dogs are CHEAP. They're asking for $500 CAD for the puppies, when he States other breeders in the area (many of whom also sound shady) were asking for 1200-2k. Breeder claims that this and the previous two points are due to the fact this is her last litter and she's getting out of breeding, due to being older and having some health conditions.

I told him these are red flags, but I believe he's blinded by cute puppies, and the fact he can actually afford them. Is there any good explanation for even some of this, and if you're all as wary as I am, is there anything else I can do or say to change his mind? Puppy pickup wouldn't be for another two weeks I believe, so maybe there's time.

731,[Help] Breeders and health testing importance/transparency,dogs,t3_a9wcac,11,False,False,a9wcac,"I made a post a couple days ago asking for opinions on a particular breeder. This brought up a some questions for me regarding health testing. I had contacted and asked the breeder for documentation, or something similar, that I could see just so I could see if their dogs really were tested for PRA, MDR1, etc. I did not receive anything official from them besides reassurance that their results are accurate based on lineage (linage was not provided and I searched OFA but had no luck). Looking at other breeder sites I've seen some dogs that have a simple description like ""MDR1: normal/mutant,"" while others have full pedigrees and include registration numbers to make it easier to look up their dogs and such. Others mention the names/locations of doctors who have examined their dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

When contacting breeders what exactly is a good response when asking about health testing? Is official documentation (a record from OFA or some other form of documentation) the main way to validate health tests or is verbal conformation that they do health tests typically what you get (i.e. ""this dog is not a carrier for \_\_\_\_"") ? I personally feel like breeders should have some sort of proof to present buyers, but is this considered too demanding/rude? This is my first experience with a breeder and I am honestly not sure what would be considered acceptable/rude on my side regarding this. I would appreciate any input! "

A few days ago she was napping on my lap and when she got up my shorts felt wet. And since then I’ve been noticing she leaves a wet spot wherever she sleeps or rests. Also I’ve been noticing a discharge from her lady parts, like a milky slightly yellowish liquid.

733,[help] Extreme shedding all of a sudden,dogs,t3_a9x67e,3,False,False,a9x67e,"3 months ago we rescued a pit bull/Bassett hound mix who is approximately 2 years old. We have been feeding him Merrick food since day one and he has shed very little. 

With the last bag of Merrick food we purchased, we noticed the kibbles were larger which was odd. I emailed Merrick about it and they advised that the food can vary because it is all natural. My dog has never puked, but he has puked twice since starting this bag. My main concern is out of nowhere he has been shedding a TON. If you pet him, you end up with a hand full of hair. He has no bald spots but is shedding a ton. I returned the bag and switched to Acana food. 

My fiancé gave him a bath today, the hair covered the tub and clogged the drain it was so bad. We are worried sick about our boy. 

The only other change in our home was a real Christmas tree, but he hasn’t gone really close to it or eaten any pines needles. We live in Illinois so the climate is cold when he goes outside, but from what I’m reading dogs don’t really shed their coats this time of year. 

He is still 100% himself and active and doesn’t seem sick at all. Loves his food and is playful. Should we just give it a few days to see if it was the food? Get him to a vet immediately? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you in advance.

735,[Help] 8 month old puppy isn’t confident and heavily relies on everything we do.,dogs,t3_a9orpv,21,False,False,a9orpv,"So the title may have been a little misleading, but I didn’t really understand how to word my issue. Basically, we got a puppy in June and we have had him since we was 5ish weeks old. He’s a small breed, and we tend to think that we’re pretty good puppy owners. Leo is usually around other humans for roughly 20% of the day considering we put him up when we leave the house. 

Now comes the frustrating part. We could leave Leo for 12+ hours (obvi we wouldn’t do that) and he wouldn’t whimper once. But, the second the door closes to the bathroom he’s screaming his head off. Similarly, we recently moved Leo to the back seat for car rides and needless to say he hates it. Not to mention he’s still very bitty and requires constant attention.

We love him very much and would never get rid of him, but we need some suggestions on how to:
    1. Stop the biting (or will is stop over time) ? 
    2. Allow Leo to understand that it will be ok if we don’t see each other for 5 seconds, or if he’s not in our arms in the front seat. 

I understand we may not have made some of the best decisions in the beginning of training, but we did the best we could. 

Edit: so funny story as to why we got him at 5 weeks. We needed something hypo allergenic and we searched for a rescue for awhile and then came across Leo on Craigslist for a small fee. They told us he was 8-9 weeks old which we fell for and mostly just fell in love. When we took him to the vet the vet immediately knew he wasn’t 8. "

Anyway, our 15 year old mixed breed (Aussie shepherd/cattle dog/lab; usually about 50lbs) started having diarrhea about a week ago. After it didn’t subside for a couple of days, we took her to the vet and they did some tests and she was positive for the giardia parasite. She has been having explosive/watery diarrhea for about a week now. She is otherwise very healthy for a 15 year old. Declining a bit due to hip issues, but healthy for her age.

She’s on metronidazole every 12 hours with a full meal (chicken and rice/bland diet) for 10 days, and liquid panacur once a day for 6 days. She’s been on the metronidazole for 5 days, and the panacur for 3 days. Her diarrhea is definitely still there. She’s having tons of diarrhea accidents at night and it’s starting to get more watery. 

Since she is a senior, this has definitely knocked her down. She’s weaker and usually INSANE about food but isn’t very interested in her chicken and rice. She was the first couple days but now only eats most of the chicken. I tried putting broth in it and it didn’t make a difference. I know side effects of both meds can cause loss of appetite but I’m worried because of her age and her love of food. She is down about 4 lbs from her normal weight. She’s still interested when we eat human food and interested in our other dogs food though. Oh and she’s drinking plenty of water/urinating regularly, which is good to see. 

So basically my questions are- has anyone had a senior dog with this parasite? Most people I have talked to had this in dogs under 1 year old. How long did it take for the diarrhea to go away and did they fully recover?

Also, is there something we can feed her besides rice for a bland diet? She likes chicken but I feel like she isn’t getting enough calories. 

Sorry this was so long! I would love any feedback.

738,[Help] Dog humping all the time,dogs,t3_a9uhde,0,False,False,a9uhde,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have an 8 year old female scottie mix who is spayed.  She is humping ALL THE TIME.  We adopted a new dog several months ago - a male catahoula mix - who she seems to genuinely like.  She will climb into his crate with him and sleep, they each sleep on the same bed most nights, and they spend a lot of time together outside.  She's older and doesn't like to fetch and while he'd love her to play with him more rough, she's older and that's not her style.  So, no signs of aggression, they share bones, no red flags.  


However, the blanket in her crib is CONSTANTLY being humped.  Like nonstop.  She's humping all day and night right now.  She has humped a couple of stuffed animals before but very rarely.  The humping started several weeks ago and seems to have reached a high right when we had holiday guests (that she knows very well and likes).  I don't know what to do but say ""stop"" but she will start up again, inevitably.  The humping doesn't seem to coincide with the other dog ""bothering"" her or invading her personal space and she is clearly the alpha in the house.  If he gets too involved or careless, she tells him to back off and he will roll over into a submissive pose.  He's still very much a puppy, you see, and sometimes gets rambunctious.  Still, that doesn't seem related.  She just had a vet checkup and nothing is amiss.  They say it is likely due to the new dog and it should subside but it only seems to have gotten worse.  


It's a really annoying behavior, TBH.  Is there a way to train her out of it.  I don't believe in punishing either one of them.  And, her being a terrier, she won't do anything she doesn't see in her best interest.  We do occasionally have to medicate her for OCD and anxiety so maybe that would help?  She's a very neurotic dog."
739,"[Help] Going to dog parks/swimming areas, and keeping doggy healthy.",dogs,t3_a9wkaq,5,False,False,a9wkaq,"Hey everyone.

So beyond ""make sure your dog's vaccinations are up to date"" I didn't think I'd have to take precautions regarding doggo's health at dog parks, but after I started taking her she started getting eye infections. Her eyes were red one after the other and weeping TERRIBLY.

So we figured it was the water she was drinking (she loves snorkelling) so I've been taking precautions with that.

But my question's not about the eye infections. That's just an example of how something I didn't see coming impacted our outings.

The question is, **what kind of other health-related precautions do I need to take when I take my dog out to the dog park**?

IE:

* Picking up after your dog to avoid spread of disease (duh)

* Vaccines (also duh)

* I've been taking her own bowl with us so that I know the water she's drinking is clean, since the bowls provided tend to get muddy, and even making sure to empty it out and refilling it wasn't enough.

* I've been flushing her eyes out with saline solution after she's gone swimming, because her favourite thing to do is snorkel. (IE, stick her head under the surface, walk around like that, lift head and shake all over innocent bystanders, rinse and repeat.)

I don't want to be paranoid, but I'm just wondering if there's ""common sense"" issues that I'm completely unaware of that I should take into account.

Our mother's also concerned that our dog will get ""parasites"" from swimming in the lagoon, but I asked her for info and her response was that she was concerned the doggo would get amoeba up her nose or something. I'm... not even sure we can get brain eating amoeba down here in Sydney but maybe there is a problem with waterborne pathogens and I need to take more precautions to keep my dog safe?

**TL;DR -- After taking doggo out to dog parks and swimming and having to flush her eyes/have her only drink from her own bowl to prevent infections, it's left me wondering what other precautions I should be taking that I'm not aware of to keep doggy healthy?**

Also, there's storm water drains nearby -- should I be letting doggo swim near that, or is it fine? It's definitely storm water, not sewage."

745,[Help] On Saturday I'll be taking away a neglected St. Bernard from my in-laws. How do we introduce him to our Maltese puppy safely?,dogs,t3_a9sazk,3,False,False,a9sazk,"On Saturday we'll take home a 4 year old St. Bernard from my wife's parents. He's spent the vast majority of his life locked up in a cage in their yard. He's been heavily neglected for the past almost 4 years, basically never played with, never groomed. His hair is under the neck and on legs is all tangled up and dirty. All they ever did was feed him. His water gets changed every couple days in the 20 liter bucket. You can imagine what that looks.

He hasn't received any kind of training. He likes us since we're the only ones who let him outside for a walk in the yard and play with him, but he's not very obedient of us, of course. I'd say he weighs around 65 kg (140 lbs). He's not been socialized with other dogs, and just introduced to a couple people.

Now I'm afraid how he'll react to our dog at home. The Maltese is 5 months old now. She's very curious, energetic, and fearless, which I fear could be to her detriment. I'm not sure how to approach introducing him to the puppy safely. He's not an aggressive dog, but I'm afraid he could get annoyed with her and bite her head off or something. So I'd like to avoid this. Them not ever seeing and meeting each other is not an option for me.

I also have some concerns about how he'll adapt to the new environment where he'll be free, and coming to another dog's territory, but that's a whole another issue. We're primarily concerned about the safety of the puppy, as I can see her being excited and jumpy around him. If not angry even. I'm not sure.

We'll also get the vet to come check him up immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 6 month old Siberian Husky, and she's the most energetic, crazy pup ever. She's literally always sprinting around the house and immediately demolishing any food we give her. That is, up until a day or two ago.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, she *always* eats her food. We've been training her to wait until we give her the go ahead so she doesn't just inhale it in two seconds. Either yesterday or the day before, though, she just kind of... stopped eating. She'll take a couple of bites of her breakfast in the morning and then leave it, then take maybe one bite around when she'd eat lunch, and then barely touch it during dinner time. She's still pooping normally which is strange to me because it doesn't seem like there's much going in, for there to be anything coming out.

&amp;#x200B;

She's hanging out at my mom's house tonight while I'm at work and my mom just told me that she ate some of her dinner and then promptly puked it all up and then some. She also didn't eat any of her breakfast this morning again.

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't changed her diet recently and she gets plenty of exercise.

Does this kind of thing normally happen with younger dogs? At what point should I start to worry or take her to the vet?"

752,[Breed] What breed is right for my family?,dogs,t3_a9uhrs,6,False,False,a9uhrs,"COPY/PASTE THE FOLLOWING FOR AUTO-FORMAT WITH BULLETS

Copy/paste the text below into a new text post..

Replace ""ANSWER"" with your response but do not delete the asterisk (*). Leave a space between the asterisk and your response.

Remember to include [Breeds] in the title of your post.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I grew up with dogs. They were all outside dogs and we lived in the country. I am in an urban area and am looking to get an inside dog.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I am wary of rescue's. I have children (3 &amp; 5), and their safety is my #1 priority. I would prefer to have a dog that could grow up with them in the house to avoid safety issues.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I would like to have a dog that isn't large (we own our house, but it isn't a big house). Is cat friendly, is excellent with kids, and is NOT high energy. Medium to small size would be best, with an excellent temperament. Also, I would like to avoid the smell of a hound (the beagle smell).

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Something like a Pug, that isn't all messed up. I really don't know what other medium to small breeds fit the bill of not requiring too much exercise.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands, sit, stay, recall.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work full time, so it will need be crated while I am at work (about 8 hours straight). I could probably make something work out while it was in the puppy stages to cut that timeframe different for awhile until it had a large enough bladder.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30 minutes to an hour. In the summer this number will be much higher since I like to hike (I would avoid hiking with the dog if necessary due to issues with its breed or size). 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Looking for as low maintenance as possible. Not looking to pay a professional. Maybe once a month.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Small to medium.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I would prefer less shedding and slobber. Barking I can handle as long as it can be contained by training.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important. If the dog is outside it will be on a leash or a lead.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I want it to be nice.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I don't have any tolerance for this.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggressiveness is a no go. I'm pretty hardline on this.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 8-9 hours a day while I am at work (at most, it varies with my wife's schedule).

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Their desires are reflected in this. I have two small kids (3 &amp; 6). My primary concern is that the kids are safe.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a house cat.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No. I own my house.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Ohio. I live in an unincorporated township.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers can easily hit in the 90's, winters can get pretty cold as well (30's).

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I am looking for a kid friendly, low maintenance dog that physically fits in our house and doesn't require a lot of exercise, but is able to hike.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

753,[fluff] Our Christmas Eve stray.,dogs,t3_a9p758,31,False,False,a9p758,"I’ve never posted before in this sub but I’ve been following for some time, I thought this made for a pretty good post/holiday. 

My husband works in the oil fields in the Midwest US. Right now our temps are slightly above zero, freezing rain, terrible awful weather. 
He was working on Christmas Eve (having a shitty day, so was I) and when he went to a disposal there was a border collie roaming around. Super friendly, showed up a few days ago but no one at the disposal knew her and no farmers live nearby for miles. 
Meanwhile, her entire butt is severely matted, full of dried dead worms, (who apparently couldn’t make it out of the matting) she’s extremely bloated from the infestation, hungry, cold, and her pads are frostbit. She was wearing what looked like a 20 year old collar with no tags and it’s not uncommon in this state to dump dogs before leaving for home (out of state), or cowboys that don’t give a 💩 about dogs (chained up outside in sub zero temps)

Husband realllllly tried to not add a second dog to our family.
But he brought her home. We had to shave the matting out (she couldn’t actually go to the bathroom because the matting was so thick). We’ve fed her teeny meals throughout the day so it didnt’t shock her system, she actually managed to poop (hurray!) and she’s getting along pretty well with our resident (also adopted) male dog. They’ve had some vocalizations but nothing violent. Thank god. 
She’ll be going to the vet soon (within a week) to get looked at and get her shots.  She’s having a little hard time breathing, and she’s pretty lethargic and tired, but she really wants to be spunky and puppyish. We suspect maybe lungworms or an upper respiratory infection from eating roadkill/weather, so fingers crossed for minor health problems instead of anything severe!
And before anyone says it, yes, all precautions were taken, our dog is up to date on all vaccinations and he’ll be receiving a round of wormer with her, they use separate areas of the yard and have their own space (just to clear that up). My husband has vet experience and grew up in a vet family so, we’re definitely alright. 

It’s funny to say, We were thinking about adding a second dog to our family for a while but decided to keep the space open because we seem to always stumble upon the dogs that really need help. I’m so glad we waited. 

Her name is Eve. 
Yes, I was going to default to Santa’s Little Helper if no one decided a name. 
If anyone has any tips for maintaining a peaceful environment between a resident and new dog, that would be great! Maybe ways to help them bond a little better? Or stories of how your dogs bonded, how long it took, do they just tolerate each other or actually care etc. This will be my first time having two dogs (not my husband’s), so I’d love to hear your experiences. 
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

You are all  smarter and more experienced than I am, especially considering I've  never owned a dog before.

This is what  I'm really going to have to consider before I move on with my thoughts.   I need to clear with my housing authority first, but the pet policy is  pretty open.

I will need to be looking at:

A cuddle pup, one that won't mind climbing up with me on the bed and hanging out

Low  activity as far as room to run out high energy.  I am in a quiet,  somewhat rural neighborhood, but I can't have a high energy dog that had  to run, especially because I'm on a hill.  I have a park at the base of  my high energy that will be acceptable for walking.

I  know age is going to be a big thing when it comes to a tempered dog,  like no new pups for example.  I'm thinking 4-5 years, though I'll not  sure if it's a good goal or not.  I just don't want one that will pass  within a couple of years.

But he still gets very scared so easily that he pees uncontrollably if we bump each other at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we went for a long walk all the way into the woods at the end of my apartment complex. I often have him off leash as he listens to me. Even if he runs off to chase a squirrel, he doesn't go far and comes back. It was different today; he chased something (for some reason, yelping while chasing), and I didn't realize the fence wasn't complete. He ran off and disappeared. I called his name and tried to find him in the woods for a while, to no avail. I realized I wouldn't be able to find him and walked back home. He wasn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought someone eventually would call me since he has a collar with my number, and he's microchipped. About 30 minutes later, I heard a bark (I don't recognize his bark as I only heard him barking a few times for the entire year). I thought it would be another dog somewhere, but opened the front door just in case. There he was sitting in front of the door. What a good boy. I always wondered if he is happy with me as I'm a first time dog owner. I guess he at least thinks this is his home to come back to."

759,[Breeds] What Type of Dog Would You Recommend for Me?,dogs,t3_a9u29m,10,False,False,a9u29m,"\*\*So I am finally paying off my student loans this week, and told myself I would not buy a dog until I paid them off. Now I am starting my search for my first ever dog (did not have one growing up) and could not be more excited! If you all could offer any help regarding the breed I should get or general advise, I would greatly appreciate it.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Growing up my family had a farm dog and some farm cats, but that was when I was in elementary school. I have not had any pets since then, though I begged and begged my parents for a dog with no luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I do not have a preference; however, if going through a breeder for a specific type of dog will reduce the risk of my dog having health issues, then I have no problem going that route.

&amp;#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* I want a dog who is fun and active and can hangout with me in the Texas heat outdoors, but when it comes time to relax at night, I want my dog chilling out with me. I'm a bit of an old man and don't do anything but relax past 9 PM during the week and go to bed around 11.

&amp;#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

\* So far I have looked into French Bulldogs, Boston Terriers, and Great Danes. These dogs seem to be good apartment dogs for someone who is not home all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Nothing too crazy, I just want to dog to be well mannered, crate trained, and maybe some basic commands.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Around 3 hours on a normal week day,as I go to the gym 4 to 6 times per week. Some weekdays I do not work out and would be spending 5 or 6 hours with my dog, and on the weekends we'd be spending upwards of 12 hours together.

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

&amp;#x200B;

760,[Breed] What dog breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_a9u23k,4,False,False,a9u23k,"Introduction

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my boyfriend and I's first dog as independent adults. We both grew up with dogs and I have been the primary care-taker/carer of our dogs since I was 12 (this includes an old special needs dog, and then a boxer and husky puppy which I raised, both of which turned out lovely and well behaved). 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I would prefer to rescue a dog, though my boyfriend has never had a puppy and wants to have one at least once so I agreed that if we can't find a puppy that fits our lifestyle in a rescue within ~6 months then we can begin looking for a reputable breeder. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.

While I personally don't mind energetic or vocal dogs (I love my husky more than anything) we will be in a one or two bedroom apartment with overall very limited space. So I would need a dog that is quiet and has at least controlled energy similar to a greyhound. I enjoy outdoor activities so it will be exercised but I don't want it to tear up my apartment if I miss a day. I also prefer dogs that are smart and think for themselves. Ex. In the case of my husky and boxer, the husky is very intelligent and quickly learned many tricks, but only performs them if he recognizes a mutual benefit. Whereas the boxer is very difficult to train but eager to please. She understands all of two commands but performs them with so much enthusiasm lol. I find it more endearing that my husky is so independent and headstrong but actively chooses to obey and be affectionate with me, whereas my boxer is just happy and obedient with everyone and no matter what so it takes away from the depth of the connection for me for some reason.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I prefer mutts, and otherwise the dogs I like are not well suited to apartments so I'm not entirely sure about this one.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I'd like for my dog to know basic commands at the very least, but I find that even the slowest of dogs (my boxer lol) are capable of learning basic commands so I'm not too worried about this. If they can be trained further that would be fun but I know that typically tends to pertain to higher energy breeds.

Care Commitments

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I am stuck at the hip to my dogs, so most of my time at home is spent with them. Focused one on one training I could do at least a couple hours a day until they're older, which would taper off to one hour.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

My boyfriend and I both enjoy going on walks so they'll probably get at least one long walk a day, maybe two. There are no dog parks in his area but local general recreational parks will be visited frequently where there are other people and dogs to interact with. Would occasionally visit trails but they're far off from our city apartment so not a regular thing.

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

More than happy to do any grooming tasks, I work at a vet clinic and am capable of doing most basic things but for any advanced/styled hair cuts (ie. Poodles, etc) I wouldn't mind visiting a professional groomer.

Personal Preferences

9) What size dog are you looking for?

I tend to prefer larger dogs but I'm not picky. I'm inclined to say a medium size breed would be better as I wouldn't want a large dog to be uncomfortable in cramped quarters.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I don't mind shedding at all, the boyfriend isn't a huge fan but it's not a deal breaker for him. Would prefer less slobbering but again not a deal breaker. Cannot be very vocal though unfortunately, I will miss my Husky's singing voice for sure!

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It's not very important to me as there are limited scenarios wherein my dog would be allowed off leash, but if they can be trained to do so it's definitely not a bad thing.

Dog Personality and Behavior

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly to the max lol

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I'd prefer one that does it's own thing but still enjoys my company. 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

An unreactive dog would be better, as it cannot be very loud, and while I am ok with putting in the extra work to socialize particularly anti-social breeds, it would be nice if they were at least indifferent or receptive to meeting strangers and visitors. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Yes

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I would like to avoid loud/vocal breeds.

Lifestyle

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Each week-day they would be left alone for ~6-8 hours depending on my classes and work schedule, but my boyfriend has finished school so he works 6am-4pm so he's consistently home in the evenings regardless. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Boyfriend is on the same page for the most part, no major disputes. He will help in taking care of the dog when I'm not home but I will be the primary care-taker.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We would like to have a cat or two and possibly other various small pets later on.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Boyfriend has a 4 y.o. niece who will visit occasionally.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No known restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Metz, France. In the past pitbull and mastiff type breeds have been banned, and supposedly still are, though they're common in the area so I'm not 100% sure on the situation and there's no info online, but to be safe will avoid these breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Moderately cold winters, 20-30F and little snow. Very warm summers 70-80F.

Additional Information and Questions

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Any mix of breeds is ok as well. I'm not too heart-set on any specific breed as I know each dog is an individual and tends to conform to their home lifestyle when brought home at a young age, but still would like to have a feel/expectation for the breed as a whole.

761,[Help] Does this look like Syringomyelia?,dogs,t3_a9uy1f,2,False,False,a9uy1f,"Just took my dog for a walk and my little guy is doing what appears to be a classic sign of syringomelia. He also definitely shows sensitivity around his neck and head and yelps if someone touches him there sometimes...He is 1.5 years old and I got him from a reputable breeder intentionally to mitigate the risks of him getting this condition (his dad is a champion show dog and comes from a good line of dogs).

Obviously bringing him to the vet but since it's late at night was just curious to hear all of your thoughts... video at the link

762,[Fluff] Some Christmas drama courtesy of our pup,dogs,t3_a9h1yf,75,False,False,a9h1yf,"Our 1.5 year old chocolate lab snuck up to the closet where we were hiding the Christmas gifts last night around 11pm. He found a pound of chocolate-covered raisins and ate them... all of them. We had a holy-shit moment as we collectively realized... Chocolate: bad. Raisins: worse! 

Thankfully, we discovered what he'd done relatively quickly. I called our vet's emergency number and the sweetest woman on planet Earth talked me through getting my dog to ingest some hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting, which worked right away. We've been keeping an eye on him, and it's now more than half a day later with no apparent illness, so I think we dodged a bullet.

This dog, man. He's a handful and a half but I just can't stay mad at him, especially on Christmas."
763,[Help] 10 year old dog - Collapsed trachea &amp; enlarged heart advice,dogs,t3_a9opmr,11,False,False,a9opmr,"I'm looking for any advice for my current situation. Our 10 year old family dog, Ozzy (Cairn Terrier Jack Russell Mix), has been dealing with a collapsed trachea and enlarged heart for a little over a year now. That's roughly when the coughing started.

I've watched it slowly progress into something that truly breaks my heart to see/hear. We've taken him to the vet many times, and have been given codeine + a water pill, since apparently he had excess fluid build up. He has moments where he is quiet, but even then, I notice this constant heavy breathing, almost like he is struggling. When he gets into a coughing fit, it has evolved from the standard ""goose"" sounding honk that comes from the cough, to more a sound that I can only describe as similar to when a human has a really ""airy"" and long laugh that comes more from them exhaling a ton/pushing air out. These can last for 5-10 minutes, and he will either pace around, or lay down with belly facing the ground, front paws out ahead, and resting his chin on them. He's recently got into sneezing fits during these episodes as well. 

The medicine we were given, I imagine, stops these episodes from happening more frequently, but any time he gets excited (which is a lot), they start up. We also have a 3 year old Black Lab/Shepard Mix, who is very gentle with Ozzy, but in recent times hasn't been able to play with him because of these episodes. It's difficult because some nights he'll sleep through the night, and other times he'll have us all up with that cough and breathing issues. The water pill also has him going out more, as expected, but he's recently started to have some accidents on the cough, which I'm presuming happen while he's coughing. 

His appetite is still pretty good during all of this, and you can tell his still has energy when we let him out, because he'll run as fast as he can (even though he'll start coughing during this). I guess I just don't know what to do. It really seems to me as if he is suffering more than he is ""calm"". Surgery for him is out of the question, especially for his age. I don't know whether I need to start thinking about having him put down, or do I try to get a second opinion somewhere else? 

I love this dog so much, but I hate seeing him suffer and just want to make sure I'm making the right decision.

Any advice/suggestions from you guys would mean a lot. Thanks!

So we decided to send out her DNA (yes haha). It came back as Plott hound, collie, shepherd mix. Although I believe most of it, I don’t fully trust it. Everyone likes to guess what breeds she could be. 

She’s 10 months old now &amp; her temperament is stubborn, lazy, and loving. Very sweet and interested in smelling everything. She’s almost 60lbs. Makes a clicking nose when outside smelling the ground. Everyone is her new best friend.

We got a puppy pug. He's now 6 months. So often during the day, the older pug will find one of the puppy's toys and pee on it. Which prompts him to think it's time to pee and will pee right next to it.

This will happen even if they've been outside just half an hour before. When they're outside, when one pees, the other will likely pee right on top of that spot. This can go back and forth sometimes up to three times.

How do I stop this behavioral problem in both animals? The older dog showing that it's okay to pee indoors is not acceptable behavior and is teaching the pup very bad habits."

Over time as they settled in and got more used to us they started to become more “vocal”. Not necessarily with barking, though there is some of that of course. But of you cuddle one of them, he “purrs” and it is LOUD. Our other dog does it too but not as often or as loud. At first I thought maybe we were hurting him somehow by cuddling and he was trying to tell us? But nope. Asked the vet at our annual visit and they said it’s pretty common.

Is there anything else I should know about or consider when it comes to what breed or age of dog?

Thanks!

772,[help] any kennel cough home remedies?,dogs,t3_a9vxx3,1,False,False,a9vxx3,"Hello all,

I’m here to talk about my little guy Benny. The fiancé and I adopted him last Sunday. Sunday he was fine, Monday he was fine, Tuesday he was perfect. Before we went to bed Tuesday night, he coughed out a little bit of flem. We made nothing of it, and got some sleep. Wednesday we woke up, and he had been throwing up white foamy “flem” and it persisted all morning, afternoon, and evening. We have an appointment for him tomorrow. The assumption is that he has kennel cough. He was vaccinated for it early December. When we called the adoption center, they called us over to go pick up antibiotics, which he later threw up. Now we have an appointment tomorrow morning, but we are are obviously very concerned. Is there something we can give him just to get us, and most importantly him through these next 10+ hours? 
We are camping out with our little buddy in the living room tonight. Will probably be up most of the night. 

So far the only thing he has been able to hold down is some chicken. He held it for about 45 minutes. Any times he drinks, or eats his kibbles, he throws up. He’s been throwing up randomly. Now he’s just laying in his little bed next to us. 

We were told not to take him to urgent care considering because they didn’t deem it to be serious enough.

773,[help] my old man,dogs,t3_a9vsot,3,False,False,a9vsot,"I've had my old friend for almost 11 years- ever since I adopted him at 8 weeks at an animal shelter I worked at. He's been a great companion for most of my adult life. 

But just within the past couple of years, there's been a decline in his overall health and personality. He stopped eating for awhile and I started using wet dog food to help entice him to eat his dry. (He's now on a grain free dry mix that he eats with interest) 

He started getting a bad rash during the summer so I thought it was seasonal allergies, but it stuck around. I'm giving him weekly baths with 3 different shampoos to help with his itch (which they do greatly!) Where he chewed most of the hair off on his hind end, it is growing back in. 

He started going to the bathroom in my daughter's room and just recently would pee on the Christmas tree, all while we are home and able to let him out. He basically stopped telling us he needs to go outside. So he has to be in an office when we aren't home. And 10/10 he uses the bathroom in the office which has been a big stress at home. The other night, we were home all day and he was let out many times, but he still went in my daughter's room to poop while we were in another room.

He acts like he can't hear us at all. Walking up to him and brushing past him makes him jump. And he basically ignores us or looks at me blankly when I groom him or pet him. He use to show an expression of love or Joy whenever I sit next to him now it's kind of blank or sad.

It has been stressful the past year or so and we are on a tight budget currently so I can't take my 65+lb dog to the vet and afford the check up.

I guess what I am asking for is advice. Someone asked me if it's time to put him down. But I felt like it was only necessary if he was in pain. I'm not sure if he's in pain. He just isn't the same dog anymore and it's sad with him seeming so depressed and disconnected.

776,[HELP] What should I pay attention to when choosing a purebred dog? (Concerning the dog's health!),dogs,t3_a9xzwr,14,False,False,a9xzwr,"Disclaimer: I don't condone inbreeding in ANY kind of dog and I think it's horrible how people will breed a dog so it can't breathe (all kinds of bullies and pugs), walk when it's slightly older (German shepherd), and other cruel issues that will hurt the dog in its life. I am however inexperienced and would like to learn from you guys how to best go about getting a puppy that won't suffer in life because of asshole breeders.

&amp;#x200B;

Facts:

I would like to have a medium sized dog close in appearance/character to a border collie. I just love how they look, how smart they are, and how active they are. I intend to get such a dog mostly because it will be an incentive for me to exercise, and I'd love teaching him or her new tricks and keep him/her busy.

It does not HAVE TO BE a purebred dog and in fact I would PREFER a non pure-breed but with a LOT OF BORDER COLLIE in it so it retains characteristics (size, cuteness level, etc, most of this is personal preference, some of it, such as size, is practicality).

As this point I am NOT really considering adopting a shelter dog as my family has had trouble (real, real trouble) with them in the past, and I simply have (learned) too much respect of dogs' teeth to be comfortable with a dog I haven't raised myself. (Feel free to change my mind.)

&amp;#x200B;

All right. I've long thought about getting a dog and will probably think a while longer until I'm sure I want to be THIS responsible (I have a track record of being irresponsible that I'm trying to change). A discussion with my partner last night made me think and research more closely into health-issues purebred dogs can have.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two questions in particular:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) If we get a purebreed dog, what should we look out for? My partner says it's a matter of looking at a family tree and seeing if at some point in the dog's ancestry (although no further back than say great-grandparents) the dog's line was mixed with some other breed, which would minimize the chance of dog suffering from some sort of inbreeding condition. Is it that simple?

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Is it possible to find a breeder who will deliberately mix in a different breed every once in a while to ensure the dogs are as healthy genetically as they can be?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else we should consider before getting a dog? The actual acquisition of the dog might still be some time off, but I'd like to know as much as possible beforehand to prepare for it."

780,[Help] Is my diffuser making my dog sick?,dogs,t3_a9rf5x,2,False,False,a9rf5x,"Hi all. I'm new to this community and I am on mobile fyi.

I got a nice diffuser for Christmas and I'm in love with it! Problem is that I just read that it may be harmful to dogs, I'm seeing conflicting articles online about it. I don't know if it is just from injestion from the oils or the smells that cause them harm (or none).

Now background: My dog puked three times today and yesterday (total not each day). Once in my basement, once in the car, and once in the kitchen. I assume the car and kitchen one was from the car ride, because she gets carsick.  As for the time in the basement: that is not where I keep the diffuser. She has always been a puker because she eats grass and socks (we are trying to get her not to eat them and take them away when we see her have them).

Anyway, I assume they are unrelated to the diffuser, but I need to know because I am an extrenely paranoid person and obviously don't want to hurt my dog. If it is the diffuser, should get rid of it or at least not keep it on near my dog? Thank you.

781,[Help] 4yo dog tore her ACL,dogs,t3_a9p2ir,13,False,False,a9p2ir," My 4.5-year-old doggo has torn her ACL, and my heart is broken for her. She has had a minor limp for awhile that comes and goes and the vet suspected arthritis. Now a few days ago, the limp suddenly got so bad and she refuses to bear weight on it. I brought her in again and after xrays, the vet suspects a torn ACL, as well as arthritis. 

The vet told me I have two options - $4K surgery or strict rest and anti-inflammatories for life. She and I are both very active, and since she’s so young, I feel like the surgery is non-optional. She’s everything to me and it feels so awful to watch her have to lay around all day with no exercise. However, I’m fresh out of grad school, and $4K is going to be such a tough amount of money to come up with. 

Looking for any advice, similar experiences, words of wisdom, words of encouragement anyone might have.

We live in the Twin Cities in Minnesota. I’m wondering if there are any less expensive options out there - maybe surgery through the University? Is that a thing? We’re also struggling with stairs during this rest time - she’s not supposed to be climbing up stairs or jumping on furniture, but she weighs 50 lbs and it’s tough for me to carry her up 3 flights. Is there a way around having to carry her?

784,[Breeds] Is a Silken Windhound or a Windsprite right for me?,dogs,t3_a9plbi,1,False,False,a9plbi,"Formatting is off, sorry!

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first, I have two herding breeds that I got when I was in my mid-20's - I adopted an adult from a show-line breeder and purchased one as a puppy from a working-line breeder.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I'm certain that I'll only be able to get either a Silken Windhound or Windsprite from a breeder, so I'll go that route. I'm okay with either an adult needing to be rehomed or a puppy.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* What I'm looking for in this particular dog is a nice house pet that's ready to play/train/work when asked, but also okay with relaxing when asked. We have a fairly laid-back lifestyle so I'm looking for a dog that will be okay with that. My two current dogs are extremely willing-to-please herders, but that level of biddability is not something I'm necessarily looking for in my next dog. Trainability for basic manners is a must. It would also be really nice to have a dog we can bring to cafes and shops and such.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Silken Windhound or a Windsprite, but I'm not sure about the difference between the breeds. We've been involved with greyhound breed rescue in the past and enjoy sighthounds.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* This dog will primarily be a pet, although it would be nice to dabble in agility or coursing with it. I take agility classes with my current, younger dog, and I'm hoping to compete with her someday. We've actually had quite a few sighthounds in our agility classes, and it'd be nice to try it out with a Windhound or Windsprite, although I'm 100% aware that the training process will be vastly different with a sighthound than with my balls-to-the-wall herder. I take rally classes with my older dog, and we hope to compete someday, as well.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* To be honest, I wouldn't be *that* interested in training with this dog other than basic manners or CGC-type training, and possibly dabbling in agility. This dog would primarily be a companion animal. If it happens to take to agility, I would of course be ecstatic about that and pursue it, but I'm not expecting it to be a fantastic sports dog right out of the gate. 

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* 1 hour of walks or leashed hikes daily. There's a fenced park right next to our house that would be ideal for off-leash running if needed. My current dogs and I hike off-leash almost every day, and we put on a lot of miles during the weekend.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Yes to everything, would be willing to brush briefly daily.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-large. I've fostered greyhounds in the past and found them to be lovely dogs, but too large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle a moderate amount of shedding and barking, but I hate slobber.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* My current dogs are great off-leash, and I walk them off-leash in the woods every day. However, I'm not necessarily looking for that in my next dog and am 100% okay with them being leashed at all times.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine, but snuggly is better. I understand that sighthounds can be a bit aloof, and I'm okay with that.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either is fine.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* My preference is that they'd greet strangers and visitors with friendly curiosity rather than a boisterous, loud greeting. I'm okay with alert barking.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, especially because I have two current, resident dogs. My house is not set up for a crate-and-rotate situation, nor am I willing to manage that behavior.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Human or dog aggression/reactivity, resource guarding, escape artists. Prey drive *may* potentially be an issue (please see below).

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* We have regular, full-time work schedules, so potentially up to 10 hours a day. We already hire a dog walker to come mid-day for our current dogs. We also send our dogs to daycare 2 times a week.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My partner likes dogs and would help with 50% of caring for the dog, except for the sports-related and training activities - I'd be doing all of that.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* So this is the main problem I might be up against. I have two cats, which may pose a problem with prey driven sighthounds, but I'm hoping that raising a puppy or adopting a cat-friendly adult will help with that.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. We have relatives with small children (1-6 years of age). We'd supervise all interactions and would crate/separate when necessary.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope, we own our house.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in the United States. Sighthounds aren't banned here.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* We live in New England; summers here can range from 70-95 F and winters can range from -10-40F with snow and ice. We're willing to invest in clothing to keep a sighthound warm during the cold winter months.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* I'd like to know what the differences are between Silken Windhounds and Windsprites. My understanding is that Windsprites will be extremely close (if not identical) to Whippets in temperament, but my understanding of Windhound temperament is a bit unclear. I've met a couple in the past and they've seemed very typically sighthound in personality. They were a bit aloof, loved to nap, and had gentle, mild temperaments. One of the Silken Windhounds I met was good off-leash, but I understand that this may be the exception rather than the rule."

I’m fostering a 2 year old Boston terrier that hates everyone except for a few people (she is very sweet and loving with me, my boyfriend, and a few other select women) and I’m trying to curb this behavior. It’s not just that she’s scared or dislikes other people- she can be downright aggressive. Lunging, growling, barking. I don’t know if she’d actually bite someone and I obviously haven’t tested it. She does it no matter where we are (though I’ve been trying to not take her in public until I know how to handle this), though she’s specifically much worse with men and she’s MUCH worse at home than anywhere else. 

This is something I knew I would have to deal with (she was like this at the shelter too, I actually was only able to take her on because I work there and she really took to me while I was working with her. They would not adopt her to anyone or allow the general public to foster her), but now that I have her I’m not sure how to handle it because I’m so afraid of her biting someone (shelter policy is that if she bites and it breaks skin/needs any medical attention, she’ll be put down basically. It’s harsh) that I don’t even know how to begin working with this. I have some very understanding friends that are willing to help me, as well as the entire shelter staff, but I’m not sure what the best way to go about this is so that I don’t make the behavior worse. I don’t want to make anything worse by trying to help. It’s worth noting she’s extemely protective over me. She’s aggressive with new people regardless, but she’ll even growl at my boyfriend, whom she loves in general, if we play wrestle or he accidentally hits me or something.

789,[Help] An Aggressive Golden.,dogs,t3_a9ne6b,29,False,False,a9ne6b,"Sorry on mobile. 

Hello, I’m looking to see if other people have had similar experiences and if there’s any tips or strategies anyone could offer. So my sister has a 1 year old Golden Retriever and he can be quite aggressive. When he was a few months old he started to resource guard, take his toys into his crate and growl if you went near him when eating. He’d also pounce on you if you went into his crate to clean. 

As he’s gotten older he’s started to become aggressive in that you could be petting him and he’s enjoying it then he’d turn so quickly and snap at you. He’s caught my sister a few times and he bit a close family friend who the dog has known since he was a puppy, it was so bad she had to get a tetanus shot. 

He’s snapped at my oldest niece for petting him and my sister doesn’t let her toddler anywhere near him without his muzzle on as she’s scared that he may snap at her. 

The resource guarding has gotten better, as in you can be near him when he eats just no touching. He also does lunge for anything thats not his and does usually give it up with no treat. It’s more the petting issue. He does warn you when he’s had enough as he will lower his head and there’s a twitch in his upper lip that if you don’t stop he’s going to attack. 

It’s certainly not what I would say is normal for the breed and he’s not suffered anything traumatic since my sister bought him from the breeder though I cannot for sure say nothing happened to him when he was with his litter. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this or are there any tips anyone could suggest? 

Edit: Just an edit I’ve mentioned in a reply but I should set the record straight. Regarding the muzzling this was a misunderstanding by myself. He wares a halter to help with lead training which doesn’t cover the full mouth it’s a band over the mouth to help control him when he’s out as he’s quite strong and used to pull when he was younger. He’s actually really good outside and there’s never been a problem with aggression or anything of the sort when he’s out walking. "

* He was abused before and so is scared of a lot of things.
* He has bitten 1 of my brothers friends a couple years ago
* He lunges at other dogs and people he dosent know. Once he knows someone thought he is an awesome dog.
* very attached to me get nervous if I leave the house for 10 minutes but seems fine with my work schedule just not when I come back and try to leave again.

**The situation**

My girlfriend and I, who I lived with broke up and so now its just me and Roman. I moved to a new state because I just changed career paths. I have paid thousands for training and his hip surgery. I also pay a lot to have a dog walker come every day in the middle of the day to take him out and hang out with him for 30 minutes. I also cook his meals cause he loves it.

My family are not dog people so I constantly hear how a young professional shouldn't have a dog and I should give him up and so on. Ive been told to give him up and get a dog who is friendly and trained from a breeder.

**My Question**

What can I do? I cant have people over I cant take him to other people's places, no dog parks. How can I make him this happy dog I can take to a barbecue and let go without worrying? Im in the beginning of my career and I cant spend too much money but I am willing to commit time and effort.

Also any advice on how a single person can manage a social life when they live with a dog (also travel once in a while)? Would getting a second dog give him a buddy to hang out with while I'm at work or the gym?

I told her we're in the middle of planning a wedding and now wouldn't be a great time to purchase one.  I said wait until after we live together then we can get one. That wasn't good enough she pestered me for weeks to buy a dog and after weeks of bothering me like an idiot I told her yes.(first of many mistakes) She didn't just go to a shelter and adopt one like a normal person she goes and spends $3000 on a French bulldog(Yes, $3000 for a French bulldog in the middle of planning a wedding) She wanted surgery done so she shelled out another $8000 for her surgery and $2000 for boarding/training for the new puppy.  Yes within a month my wife drops 5 grand on a puppy.  She's excited and I'm annoyed haven't met the dog and already aggravated.  When I visit her in Virginia(I was living in Maryland) I finally saw him and he was a cute little thing but I noticed something(first red flag) she always kept him in the kitchen away from the house.  I'm not a dog person by any means but even I understand that you can't keep them in the crate away from everyone all day that's just cruel.  So I gave her some suggestions about how to be a better pet owner.  Then she asked me could I let him outside?  Nothing crazy about that but she never put him on a leash just allowed him unrestricted access to the yard because it was easier that way.  Then every time I visited her she asked me if I could walk, feed, and give her dog potty breaks and would get upset if I didn't. Quick story I don't dislike dogs but after my baby sister was mauled by a great Dane and needed stiches in her foot I've been cautious of them. It didn't help that I was chased by a stray Rottweiler for 6 blocks when I was younger so don't have warm memories of them. Finally we get married and after months of this I get fed up and confront her about it.  Why do you pawn him off on me when I'm around it seems like you don't want to fully take care of him.  She told me that I'm her husband and it's my job to help her take care of him.  If you don't help me with him this is going to cause issues in our marriage now suck it up and deal with it.  As much as I didn't like that answer like a fool I shut up and dealt with it.  I asked her to potty train and house break him before we move in together.  She tells me she will deal with it when the time comes.  Well fast forward to when we finally move in together and he pees on the floor within 24 hours of moving in.  I look at her and just shake my head and she gives me an uneasy I'm sorry.  Then after living with her for the past few months she's pawned 90% of the responsibilities on me. Now she hardly feed him, take him outside to relieve himself, bathe him, train him etc.  He's still not house broken and pretty much sits in a 8x6 pen all day.  I told my wife that I'm not helping her spend 2000 on training if she's unwilling to follow the instructions given to us by the trainers.  The breaking point for me was she got upset about having to take him outside to use the bathroom.

794,[Help]Considering Giving our Shiba away,dogs,t3_a9stdp,3,False,False,a9stdp,
795,[Breeds] Seeking a PTSD service dog,dogs,t3_a9sq1q,7,False,False,a9sq1q," 

I'm seeking a PTSD service dog for my partner, but the dog will be owner-trained (as is the norm in our state) and raised from puppyhood by us instead of being purchased from a service dog organization, so we're kind of ""on our own"" when it comes to figuring out a breed.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, my partner and I have both had many dogs growing up and as adults have successfully raised a Pembroke corgi, who is our pride and joy. We primarily have experience with herding breeds but from what I understand they are not necessarily good PTSD service dogs as they tend to be reactive themselves.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We are definitely going through a reputable breeder so we can properly expose the dog to all situations from a young age. There are no young shelter dogs where we live.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Laid-back, not reactive, not anxious, friendly, easygoing, doesn't require a huge amount of exercise, large to extra large, kind.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* We're thinking a golden retriever is our best bet, but are open to other breeds. My partner has a fondness for GSDs but we feel the exercise requirements are going to be an issue as well as the tendencies toward reactivity.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The dog will be a service dog for my partner with PTSD and will be expected to perform those duties, which will include cueing when my partner is going to have a panic attack, leading him out of the store if he has one, etc.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* We both work from home and already know that our corgi gets many hours of attention each day, so it would be the same with our second dog. He is quite spoiled. :)

1. How  long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of  exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that  include using a dog park?

* We don't want a dog that has high exercise requirements. Our corgi gets a 30 minute walk every day, plus about two hours of more intensive play and training in the backyard (flirt poles, tug of war, fetch, etc.). A dog that needs more exercise than that isn't going to work out for us. Which leads me to greyhounds as a possibility, but we have cats and I'm not sure I'm comfortable having a greyhound around cats (especially cats that are allowed in the backyard, where there's plenty of ""chasing room"").

1. How  much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming  hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you  be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Daily brushing is a norm here. I'm comfortable with grooming at home but don't want a dog that needs frequent professional grooming. Trims at home are one thing.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Large to extra large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Our corgi is very quiet so I'd prefer to not have a barker. Shedding is fine. Slobber is fine within reason.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* The dog should be reliable off-leash in case my partner's hands are shaking and he drops the leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please.

1. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or  entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or  visitors?

* Alerting is good, but not a liability if that makes sense.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, definitely not.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression or prey drive towards humans, dogs or cats. Reactivity.

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Honestly, almost never, because the dog will be with my partner 99% of the time when we go out.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* We are both dog lovers. I will be assisting with caring for the dog and training. We do not have kids, but will be adopting eventually.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, we have a corgi and two cats.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, eventually, once we adopt.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own a house, no restrictions.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* New England, USA. No restrictions.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers are 70-90F degrees, winters are around 20-30F degrees.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* No additional questions."

I'd prefer a puppy from a reputable breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Friendly, Loyal, Intelligent, Not extremely high energy.

At the moment I'm thinking of either a Golden or a Lab. They seem to fit what I'm looking for but I'm interested in finding out about more breeds.

I live in the middle of nowhere so there's no other dogs here really but if I come across someone with a dog while I'm walking my dog, I'd rather not have a dog that's aggressive.

Nothing I can think of right now.

**Lifestyle**

We have not been able to bring her for training because she just barks at strangers and won’t stop. It would be embarrassing to walk into pet smart and nobody to be able to hear anything with her ear piercing bark. She is not aggressive and has never bitten anybody. She is skittish around dogs tho and tries to run away when they approach. When I have new people come over she barks at them for maybe 10 minutes and then calms down but if the new person gets up and walks around the barking starts all over again.

I talked to my vet about this and was told my breed is high strung (that’s putting it lightly). So he prescribed Xanax and trazedone. It hasn’t really done anything as a maintenance medication. I want to taper the meds and get her off of them but in the meantime I’m looking for suggestions.

I got her when she was 8 weeks old and she is fixed. She grew up with a big backyard and would get plenty of exercise but still lost her s*** when somebody would knock on the door or walk by the fence. So I don’t think activity is an issue..."

I'm thinking of making some paracord dog harnesses for my dogs, as I find the harnesses (especially ones with the front loop) make my dogs pull less. We also don't like the idea of choke collars and the leash pulling solely on their neck. The ones pictured above seem like pretty good designs. I understand the first design isn't exactly a harness, but I like the design of pulling the head down, and looping below the legs and behind the shoulders.

However, I have heard some people say paracord can be too rough on a dogs skin/fur, while some say it's fine. Do you guys see any issues with these designs, or using paracord in general? I love saving money and making stuff on my own, but I also want to double check the opinions with fellow dog owners to bring to my attention of any flaws or concerns with making a paracord harness.

Thanks!"
814,[Help] Dog acting off,dogs,t3_a9qdck,7,False,False,a9qdck,"My dog is a 2 year old Great Pyrenees named Daisy. We noticed the change in her behavior last night. She walked into my room last night, but after a couple steps, she backed up really fast into the corner and would not move from a sitting position. Usually, she'll come in and lie down beside me. She wouldn't move for about 20 minutes. She would whine at me (I was laying in bed) and nervously shift. She only whines at the door if she needs to go outside, but she didn't need to.

My sister picked her up to take her down stairs, but she refused to go. Eventually my sister got her to go into her room and she slept there the entire night. My sister said she hardly moved the entire night. Daisy usually moves around a lot, and she doesn't like to stay in one place for long.

This morning she followed my sister downstairs, and I let her outside, but as soon as she stepped out the door she turned around real fast and came back inside. Daisy's breed is a herding dog, and they love being outside. At this point I thought maybe it was her shock collar bothering her, so I took it off and made her go back outside. She stayed out there for about 3 minutes and then whined to come in.

Now she won't move from her spot by the couch. I'm thinking maybe she's sick, but I'm not sure. I could really use some input.

Update: So I've ruled out stomach problems. I brought her some food and she got up to eat it. "

816,[Help] My Portuguese Water Dog...is a horrible swimmer?,dogs,t3_a9qbzr,7,False,False,a9qbzr,"Hi everyone,

I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog. He's a pretty normal dog with the typical PWD quirks. We spend a majority of the time around water (a large lake mostly) on boats, at the beach, etc. Which was a large reason for getting this particular breed. The one problem we have had is that Max can't really swim. He splashes a lot, doesn't move his back legs at all and ends up vertical in the water instead of horizontal. When I have gotten in the water to try to ""show"" him how to move his legs, he just goes limp and I have to carry him back to shallow water where he can stand. We have tried getting him in the water with other dogs, but it hasn't really helped. Has anyone had any success overcoming a problem like this? Or did I just adopt the Water Dog who can't swim? Appreciate the help.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: He doesn't seem to be afraid of water, he actually enjoys being in when he can touch and seems to forget that he is a horrible swimmer. So, it doesn't appear to be a confidence/fear issue."

There is one spot-always the same spot- that he poops in during these overnight visits. We've tried cleaning it, using chemical repellents, taking him on excessively long walks, etc. etc. but he still poops in that same damn spot!

My mom has taken to just putting plastic down there (he still poops on it). He never does this if my husband and I are there, he doesn't have incontinence issues at our home (where he can stay alone for up to 8 hours on weekdays) or even at my parent's house on single day visits. He never pees just poops and only on over night stays in their house and in that same damn spot.

recently i have been noticing whenever he thinks i’m upset or will be upset he’ll just start pooping while making eye contact! 

sometimes i give him the “the freedom” command, that allows him to explore without having to follow me.  when he goes a bit too far, and i yell at him to come back,  he stops, looks back at me and starts to poop! or if we’re at a dog park, and he gets in a scuffle with another rascal, then i come yell at him, he will put his little ears down, bowing to me, i’ll tell him sit, give him a little time out before i release him again, and as soon as i do, he will go poop while staring into my eyes. 

sometimes we’re walking off leash he’ll recognize someone’s smell and he’ll dart down the sidewalk tail wagging so fast, before he stops realizing the person he smelled isn’t there or is a stranger, then just as i become close enough to see him and am about to yell at him, he will have quickly found a spot and be at the beginning of his poo dance, he does a little 360 spin into a hand stand, balancing all his weight on his front paws, angling his butthole to the highest altitude he can manage before squeezing out little turds.

Moses will be on edge, watching to see if Chip is coming, and if he does, he runs to my side and cries while I pet him. I'm really not sure what to do nor do I really know what started this. Of course they rough house around and maybe Chip had bit him too hard one time but regardless this kind of behavior is very odd for them. This had just caused a general disturbance around the house because we have to be separated with both of them and I personally am a bit afraid to leave them alone together because if Moses gets too afraid, I wouldn't be surprised if he attacked Chip, which, due to the size difference, could end badly.

832,[Discussion] Please help me decide if I should get a dog (first time owner),dogs,t3_a9n7w2,6,False,False,a9n7w2,"I’ve been strongly considering getting a dog for over a year now. Since I’ve been considering it for that long, I don’t think it’s just a whim. But I’m still not sure because I’ve always thoroughly consider weed myself a cat person. I grew up with dogs, but all of my adult life I’ve only had cats and I really only know how to take care of cats since my parents took care of the dogs growing up. I know I like being around cats and I’m happy to take care of cats. I like dogs but I’m not sure how much I’ll like taking care of a dog considering they’re more needy than cats in terms of both care and attention. I know getting a dog is a big responsibility and I’m not going to get one unless I’m 100% sure I’m going to keep it for the duration of it’s life. I’m prepared to put in the time to properly train it when it’s a puppy. I’m usually only away from home for 7-9 hours Monday-Friday for work and I do have a lunch break where I can come home to let it out to go to the bathroom if that’s too long to leave it without a bathroom break. If I travel, I take all my pets with me rather than hire a pet sitter or board them at a kennel. Right now it’s just me and two cats. I own my own house so having to okay having a dog with a landlord is not an issue. I have a fenced in yard. I live outside of town so there’s not a ton of car or people traffic. I’m mainly afraid I won’t be a dog person in the sense that I won’t meet all of its emotional needs (since dogs are more affectionate than cats; like cats are more independent and dogs are more people loving). I’m totally prepared for the walking, playing with, training, bathing/grooming, vet costs aspects. Im excited about the aspect of having an animal I can take outdoors with me (on a proper leash/harness and after it’s trained on the off chance it breaks away from the harness) like on hikes and to the beach. I’m worried I won’t meet the dogs expectations in terms of how much love it wants since I picture myself as a cat person and they’re more independent. 

1. Do I sound like I’m ready for a dog? I don’t want to get the dog and then find out I’m not ready. If I get a dog, I’m planning to keep it for life because I know it causes animals pain and confusion when they have to be re-homed because the owner isn’t ready for it and I don’t want to be one of those people. 
2. What tips/advice or other important information do I need to know or consider before getting a dog? 
3. What would be a good breed for a first time owner as an adult but having had experience with dogs as a child (just not the full responsibility of taking care of them)? I want something small (not more than 20-25 pounds), probably a toy to miniature size dog, preferably fluffy (I don’t mind putting in the extra grooming effort that comes with a fluffy dog or paying a groomer regularly if necessary) that is also sturdy enough to go on hikes or to the beach with me, is adaptable (like if I were to travel with it during  summers or if I were to get involved in a serious relationship after I got the dog [adding a new person into the dogs life possibly]), and is good with cats (I have two currently and they’re both young so hopefully not going anywhere anytime soon)."

Then about 5 months ago she started barking more at cats/squirrels, ect.

Ever since then when people come over or right now when we're visiting family, she barks at people when they come in (which I guess is normal?) but then she singles out a random person (seemingly random) and will bark at them like CRAZY.

She has some quirks that need ironed out but really, I consider myself very lucky. Considering she's had no formal training (starts in a couple weeks) she's very well mannered. 

The two biggest issues we've noticed is her escaping and her peeing in the house. 

**Issue 1:** Bailey has escaped 3-5 times in the two months we've had her. Once a week after we got her, she pushed passed my wife and out the door. It was a rainy day and I chased her in socks. She found her own way back in the front door after a while. And twice today she escaped from my parents yard (a fenced yard she's been in several times). Today she simply jumped the fence. They have a lower 4' chain link fence. 

At my house we have a privacy, board on board,  6' fence. I'm not too worried about her escaping my yard BUT I'm disappointed she can't use my parents yard to run around in as it's much larger (about an acre). 

For Christmas I got a Whistle GPS device for her collar. I've also ordered a light up collar for her. 

She's microchipped. 

**Issue 2:** She's never been house broken (that we know of). However, she seemed to pick up on house breaking pretty quickly. She goes to the door. But, if you don't make it to the door to let her out in a matter of less than a minute (sometimes less than 10 seconds) she'll pee right at the door. 

She's also more likely to have an accident at my parents/in-laws house, despite having visted both multiple times. I don't expect her to be super great about asking to go out at other people's houses but, I figured it's worth noting. "

I don't really know how to describe this, but his penis was clearly swollen and halfway out of his skin, and his anus was pulsating/flexing nonstop. He clearly could not control this, and was laying down unresponsive with his eyes nearly closed. We kept petting him and saying his name to keep him awake, but we all thought he was going to die right in front of us. After a couple minutes his penis went back to normal and his anus stopped pulsating and he was suddenly back to his old self.

850,[HELP] Convincing someone it's time,dogs,t3_a9jmzw,5,False,False,a9jmzw,"Hello all, 

I'm hoping that some of you can help me figure out how to convince my father to unfortunately, put our dog down.

For some back story, we currently have a German Shepherd, she's 11 and half years old and has had a wonderful life. Unfortunately, over the past several months her physical health has been on a decline and of recent, has gotten to the point where you can't watch her walk. Her back legs have loss muscle, and even with meds, she has been unable to walk very well. My parents have wooden floors which for sure doesn't help. I got a floor rug to cover most of the living room and smaller pieces so she can go to the back door. On carpet, she is able to walk but on wood, it's like ice. In the morning, she is able to walk but throughout the day, it becomes more difficult till the night where she pretty much settles in where ever she lays down since she can't walk, for the night. 

The issue is her quality of life just seems like it isn't what it should be. Occasionally dragging her back legs, sometimes having to stop where she is and lay down till she can gain energy to walk, hardly walk down the two small steps on our porch to go to the bathroom. It all is just so hard to see but my father insists she's doing ok since she hasn't lost an appetite, drinks her water and still very playful. Her mind is there but her physical ability to walk is seriously not ok. I need help trying to sit my father down and telling him it's time, it's very hard to no matter what but I would like any advice any one has that had dealt with the same situation. "
851,[Discussion] Help making a plan for the first few days home with a rescue,dogs,t3_a9jgyq,9,False,False,a9jgyq,"If everything goes well with my in-person meeting next weekend, I'll be bringing home my first dog within the next few weeks! I couldn't be more excited but I'm also very nervous about the first few days at home. I'm a little overwhelmed by the amount of information out there, and I'm trying to get my routine for the first few days down before bringing him home.

Here are the details: he's an almost 2-year-old Great Pyrenees mix who is great with other dogs, (allegedly) housebroken, and has no behavioral issues observed by the rescue other than a higher-than normal prey drive.

I live in an apartment building in a relatively urban area within walking distance of many parks. I've read up on the two-week shutdown and the basic steps for getting a new dog acclimated, but I have a few questions: 

* There are a lot of dogs living in my building so it will be hard to avoid them when going in and out to use the bathroom. I realize this could be stressful during the initial adjustment period but I'm not sure how to avoid it. Any tips from other apartment-dwellers?

* The dog is currently living at a rescue that keeps the dogs in kennels in a barn. They aren't sure how he would do with being crated, but I will need to crate him during the day while I'm working and I'll only have 2-4 days off of work to get him acclimated before I'm gone for the day at work. My tentative plan is to very slowly get him acclimated to the crate the first 1-2 days without actually locking him in, and then trying to put him in there for short stretches and leaving the apartment for he next 1-2 days. Does this sound like a reasonable plan for getting through this process in only a few days?

* Along the lines of the last question, I'd REALLY like to keep him crated at night (at least initially), but I don't want to rush the process if he's not comfortable in there the first day. How should I handle bedtime on day 1 if he's still wary of the crate? Is it confusing for him to let him sleep in the bed and then backtrack later?

* Since there is a fair amount of foot traffic around my building, is it okay to take him for walks during the first two weeks with the understanding that he might encounter other people/dogs, street noises, etc? Or would it be better to drive him to a more remote park to get his exercise? I'm not sure how literally to be taking the advice on the two-week shutdown.

Thanks in advance for any feedback--I am probably overthinking this a bit but I want to make sure he has the best possible experience coming home and I set him up for success in his new home!"
852,[Breeds] Looking for the perfect breed (does it exist?),dogs,t3_a9kz7e,15,False,False,a9kz7e,"My husband and I are hoping to get a dog within the next 3-5 years. We’re both career people and have 9-5 days.

(That being said, we don’t plan to get a dog until we live in an area with fenced off backyard access where they could freely roam.)

We would prefer there be tendencies toward less barking, being lazy, less clingy, less aggressive. Small-medium is preferable.

853,[Help] Visiting family for Xmas. My large dog pinned sisters small anxious dog,dogs,t3_a9gkuj,11,False,False,a9gkuj,"They met each other yesterday and were doing ok, but my dog (Sadie) apparently went to her dog (cassie) and put her head on top of Cassie’s, which I’ve been told is a sign of dominance?

Cassie didn’t like that and yelped, so Sadie flipped her over with her paws and mouth while Cassie yelped and tried to get away.

We broke it up and Sadie pretty much left her alone after that, but seemed mildly interested in watching her when she would walk by.

We recently adopted Sadie from a shelter where she was a stray so we’re still learning about her, but she has never shown aggressive energy towards us, my kids or my cat, she’s really been a fantastic addition to the family.

She once pinned my moms black lab as well, but that ended quick and now they’re best friends.

My main concern is that my sisters dog is consistently nervous around large dogs, and I’m worried that my dog will continue to pin/ harass Cassie if she keeps projecting nervous energy.

Is there anything I can do to help my dog leave Cassie alone? Should we scold her for it if it happens again? 

Additional info: we are visiting my moms house, she’s never been here and though she knows all the people here we have never taken her on a trip before.

I went to the vets and told them about my issue, they said try cerenia, so I did, if it did anything it was it made him worse I think! He was drooling and looking in rough shape, better when he wasn't on it. So Im going to say it's not Motion sickness related? I try now to get him in the front seat to look out which helps  a little but then he'll lay down and get back into the panting and all.

I've currently tried cbd oil which I think helps a tad but is not the cure.

He is a super happy dog, no fears, obedient, I've tried giving treats in the. Car and he loves that but there's certainly something there. My next thing I thinj for a road trip will be asking for something to make him sleep for a few hours.

Googling almost certainly comes to motionsickness but after the cerenia, I'd Guess it's not that at all as it's a. Very effective drug for that issue.

For one thing, over the past couple of months, I have noticed that when we go on walks and people approach us after asking to pet her, she is very wary and often tries to stay as far away from them as she can, even after I talk to them and try to show her that there’s nothing to be afraid of. This is not something she did for her first year. She used to absolutely love everyone and want to meet them all. She did have several vet appointments over the summer (spay, eye surgery, hip sprain, small skin rash from swimming) and I’m wondering if that may have had anything to do with her fear of strangers? 

She has also over the past couple weeks been barking nonstop when she goes outside. She never used to do this. She still doesn’t ever bark in the house, but she will bark at anything and everything when she’s outside in the backyard and since it wasn’t something she used to do I’m just not sure what’s going on. 

Another issue that’s been recent is separation anxiety. If I go upstairs or go to the bathroom for even a short period of time I’ll hear her whining for me until I come back, and when I’m not home and don’t bring her with me my family says she just sleeps on my bed until I get back. This is not something that’s been an issue until recently and I’d definitely like some advice to correct this. 

TL;DR My young golden retriever has recently developed fear of strangers, separation anxiety, and will bark constantly when she’s outside in the backyard. What are some steps I can take to correct this new behavior? "

I own a 1 and a half year old Cane Corso mix (110lbs), and I live in the city with a fenced in backyard. 

I don’t believe she was trying to be confrontational, but she made a comment that she didn’t believe it was right to have such a large breed live indoors. She told me “ I wish I could bring my dog indoors, but I can’t. It’s not right. He’s a large dog and he belongs outside.”

I told her I thought my dog was well stimulated, that he goes to daycare 3 times a week, the other days he gets 1-2hr walks at various off leash parks (a lot of them trails, more like hikes). At home he spends most of the day laying around sleeping, or chewing his bone. For 6 months I have had absolutely no problems with him chewing things he’s not suppose to, messing things up, peeing/pooping in the house, anything like that. He has free range of the house while I’m gone. At night he sleeps in his open door crate by choice.

To me, I’ve always learnt that this means you’ve met the needs of your dog. A sleepy dog is a stimulated dog. When I asked her about this she said “he’s a lazy dog, but he’s probably still really bored.”

I adopted the sweetest lab/shepherd mix on Saturday from the Portland shelter. She was spry and playful and amazing, but as the day went on, she was throwing up, had diarrhea, and gradually lost all of her energy.

I was very worried about her not eating and being lethargic, but I convinved myself she was overwhelmed from being adopted.

The next morning (yesterday), she had blood in her diarrhea and continued dry heaving. I immediately called a local emergency vet and took her in right away. I knew something about parvo but as a first time dog owner I've never experienced it. The vet took a stool sample and within 15 minutes diagnosed her with parvo. He was extremely solemn and kept saying that things didn't look good. I was a huge emotional wreck. I've been looking for an emotional support dog for about 5 months and basically loved her within 30 minutes. I felt so bad for her.

We called the Portland humane society and they immediately, and without hesitation, told us to bring her into their hosptial immediately. They took her in at no cost. She's currently being treated with IV fluids and monitored in a quarantined unit with her sister who was adopted the same day and also came down with parvo.

I still don't know what to make of it. They say her tail is wagging and she is ""perky"" but still has bowel issues. The vet seems optimistic but I'm still anxious.

So please, please, read up on parvo. A lot of people are getting puppies tomorrow morning and there is always a risk of these puppies being exposed to parvo. It can kill your puppy within 72 hours if you don't call your vet at the first sign of lethargy, vomitting, and diarrhea.

In June I took my dog (2 1/2 year old female spayed pitmix) with me to Dallas. During the car ride she sat in the back seat and the a/c was blowing near her face. Arrived in Dallas to the whites of my dogs eyes being pink/red. She began rubbing her eyes and keeping them closed. 

Returned to Austin and took her to the vet. Was given medicine for eye irritation. 

Eyes improved.

A week or so later her fur on the top of her head because to have large dry flakes of skin and she was losing hair. 

Back to the vet, she was diagnosed with having a bacterial skin infection.

Was given medicine over the course of 10 days, she improved. 

Fast forward to October...same thing dry flaking skin on head, muzzle and even her nose peeled and is now discolored.

Was taken back to vet and diagnosed with another bacterial skin infection. 

Same medicine and was also given an allergy shot.

Weeks go by and the skin stopped flaking....her eyes are no longer irritated but physical changes have taken place.

They dark hair around her eyes has not grown back, her nose is still discolored, her muzzle is now white and the once flaky spots on her back are now filled with white hair.

She is now losing hair starting on her hind legs. It’s moving towards her tail area.

So we had a very good relationship up until yesterday where I accidently treaded on her paw. I was very sorry and felt sooo guilty that I went up to her and tried to hug her and also checked her paw to see if it was okay. She was really pissed and scared she was like shivering heaps and kept going into the corner of the room. Today she was a little more chill and I got to scratch her belly a little more (she does this thing where she kinda rolls over) but then I tried to get her to kinda roll back over and she yelped and got realllly scared and hid in the corner of the room exactly like she did yesterday. Since then she’s been quite scared and curls up every time I come close and tries to hide from me. I just need some help because I feel like mayb she went through a lot of shit but I’m really trying my hardest to get her to chill out and not be pissed/scared.

892,[Help] I’m at my in-laws’ house for Christmas and my FIL just slapped my dog in the face. I’m upset and I don’t know what to do.,dogs,t3_a9boq0,13,False,False,a9boq0,"I have two dogs. The little one has this quirk where when you lead the older one by the collar, she starts barking at him. I don’t know why, but she does. So we just don’t do that around her. I’ve always hated the way my FIL treats my dogs (yelling at them in German when they know zero German commands, we’re all Americans, and things like that). But today the older one was outside and I guess FIL didn’t want him outside anymore because he went out and dragged him in by the collar. To be fair, he didn’t know this would set the little one off. But I saw it coming so I grabbed her collar to keep her away from the older dog as he was being dragged in. 

Anyways, she starts barking and the older one starts barking back. Then FIL reaches down and slaps him in the face. I said “don’t hit him please” And FIL said “oh sorry.” I told him I could take both dogs. When they get into a bark-off we put them in their kennels for cooldown time. But he wouldn’t let the older dog go. He kept holding his collar as I said “I’ve got this.” Eventually he slipped his collar because he was trying to get to me and so I led him gently by the scruff to his kennel. 

Both dogs were very very wound up for a while. Right now I’m sitting with them in the den, they’re asleep in their separate kennels, and I’m crying and I don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to drive home because I don’t want to be around someone who slapped my dog. But I also don’t want to cause drama and ruin Christmas. "

899,[HELP] severe seperation anxiety with aggression,dogs,t3_a99irr,10,False,False,a99irr,"I’ve posted about my dog Dixon before about this issue. He’s a 3 year old catahoula with seperation anxiety issues. He’s on Prozac currently. He has had instances of getting aggressive (growling, snarling, barking, biting, scratching,etc) when I leave my apartment. I moved recently but made sure to make it a slow move and I took a week off to get him acclimated. Everything was fine. He let me leave for work and most evenings without any issue.

Then last Wednesday my boyfriend slept over. Thursday morning my boyfriend left when I took Dixon out for his walk. Before work I usually try to go for 20-30 minutes. Then we got back inside and I got all of his toys and food ready and he did his desperate “don’t leave me” aggressive thing. 

I know I’m gonna get heat for this but I had to tie him up to my bed so I could get out of my apartment without being bit. I don’t feel good about doing it but I also can’t miss work. I’ve had to tie him up every time I left since that day. I absolutely hate it but it’s the only thing I can do right now that will keep me safe. I understand it is not safe for him but unfortunately my safety is more important. 

I’m exploring seperation anxiety training but it requires that he cannot be left alone during the duration of the training. I’m not sure I can afford five days a week of daycare/dog sitting for a month (or more). I’m also not sure there’s a daycare out there that would take him considering he’s iffy with other dogs. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on what to do until he can start this anxiety training. And maybe some words of encouragement because I’m starting to consider rehoming/surrendering because I’m at my wits end and I’m hating the fear I feel every time I try to leave my apartment. "

909,[HELP] I thought I wasn't a dog person... Turns out I just hate my boyfriend's dog,dogs,t3_a8whm2,288,False,False,a8whm2,"***update***

So I've started letting Louis out more frequently and I don't actively encourage him to drink water at night as I used to do.

He's more manageable now at the very least. Here still complains if left in the cage with no one else in the room but I consider that to be semi reasonable and I work at home so it's inconvenient but not a crippling issue.

He can't be trusted to walk around the house unsupervised because he will still Mark and hide the larger puddles of pee in hard to get to areas. The local humane society was closed for the holidays but once they get back open I'll set a date for his fixing.

One of his major bad behaviors is humping aggressively and uncontrollably for the first few days we were here Dixie barked at him and visibly restrained herself from killing him because all he wanted to do was barrel across the house with his snout stuffed in her crotch. He still does a certain amount of this and I have to imagine this will stop altogether one he's snipped.

We lost his leash in the move so I'll have to get a new one, those of you with specialized knowledge and/or experience I'd appreciate if you have a recommended leash for a 3lb dog.

BTW a lot of you have developed some misunderstandings here. I mostly haven't corrected people because I didn't think it was terribly germane to the subject of dogs or having a dog but I'll at least offer some peace to those of you who appear to have gotten the most excited about the situation.

1. My boyfriend insists that Louis' behavior was better before we moved in together. He feels guilt over the fact that in a four-year period Louis has had to change homes 5 times with Louis not even being 6 years old. His defensiveness is centered around that guilt and the conjecture that that stress of constant moving has caused Louie so much stress that he's regressed and acts now like he did as a new puppy. (I know that can happen to humans but I'm not super sure that's a thing that can happen to dogs).

My boyfriend even goes so far as to suggest that Louis is acting out in retaliation to bad treatment. I may not know dogs very well but I was a behavioral Neuroscience major so I know for a fact that only the most intellectually advanced social animals are capable of calculated indirect aggression of this sort. I no longer argue with him on that point I just roll my eyes and try to change the subject to doing something more productive than hand-wringing.

 
2. We only have Louis because my boyfriend's previous partner neglected them both, to go out and cheat with other men. So he got stuck with Louis in part because he bonded while trying to keep the dog cared for as his real owner ignored him and part because Louis was a companion during bad times. 

3. My boyfriend has trained dogs up to a decent level of behavior before. He owned pitbulls as a child and successfully trained a St Bernard named Bruno up from puppyhood to be very well behaved (or so his relations tell me). Bruno got hit by a car when he was 4 years old, two years before my bf and I met.

4. We both have ample experience with children. He raised his niece as a single father from 15 to 23. I'm satisfied with his ability to impart good values to a human. I co parented my nephew with my sister from the time I was 11. So I'm not particularly concerned

5. This isn't super relevant but a lot of you seem to think I'm a woman. As a 6'2, 270 pound man this is a rare and amusing experience for me.


***Update***

I always wanted a dog growing up, I come from a Caribbean family and we were not particularly close to other animals. what's more, my mother always feared dogs and not without good reason; my older brother got mauled on the legs pretty badly when I was about four or five.

so I went into adulthood knowing that there's a lot I would have to discover if I ever became a dog owner.

As of about 3 years ago I moved in with my boyfriend who already owned a black chihuahua named louie. And I f****** hate this dog. He pees in the house constantly no matter how many times you take him outside, he steals food, is incredibly disobedient, sometimes it will randomly take a s*** in the house. We tried crate training and all he does is whine and bark constantly until you let him out at which point he will choose one or two spots around the yard to pee in and then expect to come back in the house to relieve himself the rest of the way. Worse than that he will start baking in the middle of the night to be let out, sometimes its 3, 4 or 5 a.m. at which point I wake up make sure he gest something to eat &amp; drink, then let him out to do his business.
that wouldn't be so bad except when I bring him back inside our room and put him back in his cage to sleep next to us he just starts whining again, there are times when he'll do this five times a night.
 Worse yet, my boyfriend is a heavy sleeper who never hears him so it's always my job.


from this experience I just assumed that maybe I'm not a dog person.

But we recently started renting a room from my boyfriend's mom and she has a deaf Pitbull-mix, named Dixie. Dixie is objectively, the goodest girl, despite being deaf she always listens to commands, never steals food, always wants to cuddle, holds her bowels or bladder for half a day if she needs to, she's gentle with children, loves to play but isn't rambunctious and is generally a respectful lovable dog on all levels, I give her a kiss on the forehead Everytime I see her. She is a joy to have around and I feel bad whenever people don't make time for her.

So now I've discovered that I don't hate dogs, I just hate this particular chihuahua Louis. The hatred is deep enough that I have actually thought to myself that if Louie dies or gets lost I need to remember not to seem happy because I'm sure my boyfriend will be devastated. The other day I was preparing some candy to take to the old folks home where my boyfriend works.  I stepped away for a second and Louie jumped up onto the furniture and ripped into one of the bags.

The candy is not that expensive so I was only moderately angry about the fact that he made a mess but I actually thought to myself that I wished I had bought dark chocolate instead of cheap milk chocolate for the residents so that maybe he would've just died from eating it without anyone blaming me specifically.

my boyfriend insists that he doesn't need any training and that we just need to get him fixed which for the record we've only had the money to do in the last week or two(we used to have roommates that never paid their rent so money was always tight up until now and we didn't want to ruin our credit by breaking a lease).

I'll happily get him fixed but I doubt that these crappy behaviors are purely the result of having testicles. I'm just barely tolerating this dog as it is and I'd really like some guidance 

I know Chihuahuas live a long time so I'm hoping I can find a better solution than praying for the death of this creature.

910,[help] when to know to say goodbye? :'(,dogs,t3_a9943y,6,False,False,a9943y,"I have a 13 year old pitbull. She has really bad osteoarthritis in her hips and back legs. This has created severe mobility issues. She can only take a few steps at a time. rarely stands up on own. She has been in this condition for 2 years. My husband and i carry her outside, bring her water and food, etc. She still eats normally, has normal regular bowel movements and has control of her bowels and lets us know when she needs to go outside. She takes joint supplements, a NSAID, and CBD oil. Lately she seems to be in more pain. Panting more, whining more, where we can not figure out what she needs. In past it was typically communication for a need like water, food, outside, repositioned etc. Now she will continue whining after trying to give her all her basic needs. So im assuming its pain. Last few moths she seems more depressed and uninterested in anything that used to give her joy. She was a licker and anytime we were near her she would strain to give us kisses. Those have stopped. We have a wagon and wheel her around the neighborhood to sniff things, she no longer has an interest or gets excited on those trips. How do I know when it is time to say goodbye. Im struggling because her internal organs are functioning fine at the moment. I have tremendous guilt for thinking about this just due to pain and mobility. Is it her time? and I being selfish for holding onto her? What if she's not in as much pain as i think? I always thought I would know for sure when it was time but I have so many doubts right now that I don't know what to do. She will be the first dog I will have to make this decision. lost a dog to cancer in June and he died peacefully at home so mother nature helped me out on that one.

I need to drive with her for 500 miles after the holidays (it was either that or leave her at a boarding facility but her high anxiety makes that close to impossible). Normally in a regular vehicle she likes to ball herself up behind the drivers seat (on the floor behind between the rear seat and the back of the front seat). She feels most comfortable there in a very tight space (secure) while being close to us. 

Our upcoming trip will be in a different vehicle (Eurovan) that doesn’t have rear seats or any tight spaces so I’m looking for ideas on how to make her more comfortable. Ideally she would be between the seats in a very tight, secure spot. I’m considering making a small wooden box with three sides she can jam herself into if she wants. A crate is too flimsy — it scares her if there’s any movement or rattling. 

On her own she will try to jam herself under the drivers legs in this vehicle which isn’t safe (brake/gas pedals!) so I’m really hoping to find an alternative. To those of you thinking leave her at home, it’s not possible in this instance (we normally do). "
913,[Help] Time for a second dog?,dogs,t3_a9655j,11,False,False,a9655j,"So my husband and I are considering a second dog. But I want to make sure we are 100% ready before we jump in. I'm looking for any advice, information, and personal anecdotes you can give me.

Our current dog is a golden retriever. He is almost 2 years old. And while he was a tough puppy when we first got him he has turned into an incredible dog. He knows over 30 commands, walks well on a leash, and absolutely loves other dogs! His favorite place is the dog park and he tends to be the most popular dog there. 

We have a pretty established routine down. We take him on an outing every day. Whether it be a long walk, a trip to the dog park, or up to the mountains for a hike. 

We are looking for a slightly smaller breed than a golden retriever, probably around 2 years old, and are hoping to adopt from a shelter. 

We also have had other dogs stay over at our house before (we are Rovers) and our dog has shown no sign of resource guarding or aggression to a dog in his house. In fact he always seems a little sad when they leave. 

So what other advice can you give me? "
914,[help] my dog doesn’t know how to act around other dogs?,dogs,t3_a9aqx1,3,False,False,a9aqx1,"Whenever we pass by a dog while on a walk, or go to a friend’s house who has a dog, my black lab Barrett never really seems to know how to interact. The other dog will play bow, jump, and run around, but all he’ll do is sniff their butt and stare at them. Even when the other dog is very clearly inviting him to play, he doesn’t seem to know how. Overall he just seems confused when another dog shows excitement towards him. He plays fine by himself and with people, but doesn’t seem to know how to with dogs... He’s not aggressive towards dogs even when they’re barking right in his face, and usually at least sniffs them before just watching them run around him. Should I try to socialize him more? Is it just his personality? I though he’d have more energy around dogs considering he’s only about a year and a half..."

916,"[HELP] 7 month Cavapoo keeps wanting to hump other dogs rather than playing, will neutering help? Also is a picky eater, what can we do",dogs,t3_a97f1d,5,False,False,a97f1d,"As title says we have a 7 month cavapoo who humping other dogs (boy or girl) rather than playing with it every chance it gets.

Also our dog became a picky eater. At first it would eat dry hard food, then it wouldn't eat it so then we gave it a topper on the food which worked for a while but afterwards same issue so we had to make it ""wet"" now with the topper and dog food. After a while same issue so now we had to ""microwave"" it so it produces a strong smell so it would eat it."
917,[Help] Dogs and bunnies!,dogs,t3_a95rmj,21,False,False,a95rmj,"Hi all, been lurking in this site for good year, dog adoption thoughts have been for a year as well, more serious since September and now finally I'm ready for an adoption, ""gotcha"" date is set this Saturday the 29th.

She's super sweet mellow 6 year old lady, I have absolutely no clue what breed she is, current owner is pretty clueless also. She looks like a mix of ACD, Golden Retriever, Corgi.. She was found as stray few years ago and scooped off from streets. The current owner has had her for 2 years, but their work situation changed and the dog is home alone \~12h a day so they gave her up for adoption. I'm adopting through [getyourpet.com](https://getyourpet.com) site and so far the experience with it has been very good.

But, aside from that, my dream has always been having a bunny too. Are there any dog&amp; bunny owners here? What should I look out for? I was thinking of maybe a baby bunny would be better so they could get used to the dog and not be afraid of it. Ultimately I'd love them to be buddies, both free range. I'm fairly sure the dog is fine, based on the owner's description she's just the sweetest, never shows teeth and is all about pleasing hoomans.

Whatcha guys think?"
918,[help] How to choose a dog at a shelter?,dogs,t3_a95wjq,11,False,False,a95wjq,"I suppose there’s the “the dog chooses you” part, so I might know which dog to choose when I go to the shelter, but what things should I look out for when looking for a dog?

I live in an apartment and can take the dog for walks at least twice per day (currently I can take three or four walks per day, but I am taking into account my work schedule might change in the future).

I hope I can get a snuggly dog because I love hugging dogs (I might just hug every dog in the shelter to see which one enjoys it more hahaha).

I have two pet rats that live in a cage, they won’t interact with each other but I wish the dog won’t bark all the time at them. 

About the barking, I am very noise sensitive so I am hoping for a dog I can train to not bark? I mean, of course a dog barks, but I hoping to keep that at a minimum?

So, are there any things I should look out for when looking for a dog? I am still not sure if I want a puppy or an older dog."
919,[Help] Training advice for new puppy,dogs,t3_a97tfn,4,False,False,a97tfn,"Hi all,

My gf and I adopted a Siberian husky puppy two weeks ago and we’ve been having a blast with her. She’s incredibly smart and doing really great with the introductory training things. She’s actually the most chill puppy we’ve ever seen and we are frequently told that.

The only issue we’ve repeatedly had since getting her is when we have to leave and cannot take her with us. 

For example, every time we leave to get food or go to church things which take less than an hour and a half to two hours, she soils her crate and we always come back with her whining. 

On the other hand, she sleeps through most of the night. We started taking her out every 2 hours when we got her but now she can sleep for 4-5 hours without needing to potty during the night. Granted she knows someone is in the same room as her at these times. But she’s never had an accident during the night or whined except for the first night we had her. 

I don’t think this is a separation anxiety, as I’m sure she’s still adjusting to everything and wants to be with her “pack.”  Thoughts? 

She gets plenty of attention and exercise during the day. 

What are your guys’ recommendations on how to improve this? I’m wondering if it’s a simple as leaving progressively longer starting with just a few minutes then coming back. For kennel/crate training we did the suggested letting her get into it on her own time. She will get in on her own it when prompted with a treat. She’s on a consistent feeding and potty schedule outside these random times when we need to leave the house for a short time. 

I’ve also wondered if that above solution is the case, if we leave the room for, say 5 minutes, and she whines so we need to wait until she quiets or has an accident or return and just reduce the attempted time we try to leave until she’s never whining? Most would say not to budge until the whining stops, but I’ve also seen some say having an accident voids that and you should attend to the dog and the accident. 

Thanks for the help! Open to any suggestions and methods. "
920,[HELP] Dog feces look like raw meat,dogs,t3_a98zmh,12,False,False,a98zmh,"Hi everyone. My sister's dog, a 5 year old Entlebucher, excretes feces that look like raw meat, but has not eaten meat for weeks. Only broccoli, a carrot and dry food. It does not look like poo covered in blood, but like raw pink flesh. There has not been normal brown stool included, only that. This happened today, and before she heard a gurgling sound from his stomach (this morning), then the dog puked (noon) and then there was the poo when she went out with him. Any ideas? Google doesn't come up with much, maybe a parasite...? She just brought this up at the christmas table, so I throught I'd post it to reddit."
921,[Discussion] Is the sauna safe for my dog and why does he try to get in?,dogs,t3_a98mkr,3,False,False,a98mkr,"First time posting here, be gentle

My dog (2 year old cattle dog mutt) loves being in the sauna (my dad's Finnish) We'll get him a towel and he'll come sit in there with us and drink from the bucket and keep his nose down so he doesn't hurt his nose (it's like 150 degrees in there). We do not force him in and he actively tries to get in whenever we take saunas. Is something wrong with him? Does he like the heat? Whats up with him? And is it safe for him? He doesn't exhibit any strange behaviors in or after he goes in the sauna."

If anyone has had gallbladder removal surgery, when is possibly a safe time for me to see them? Yesterday I didn't use pain pills, but I needed them today. "
