It's about time we updated our demographic information since our subreddit--and Reddit in general--has changed so much since the last time we did this. I put together a Google survey. All answers are reported anonymously and we won't use the information for anything other than learning about the subreddit and making the subreddit better (and for fun stats like ""most popular dog name in /r/dogs""). It should take less than 10 minutes to complete, maybe a little longer if you have a lot of dogs. 

You'll be asked for the breed of your dog(s) and I added some mixes and non-AKC breeds to the list. The mixes and non-AKC breeds appear first. Scroll down for the AKC breeds listed in alphabetical order. 

Breeds not listed: 

* Mini vs Standard Poodle -- select Poodle

* Jack Russel Terrier --  select Parson Russell Terrier or Russell Terrier

* Catahoula -- added to the end of the list

* Afghan Hound -- added to the end of the list

* Pyrenean Mastiff -- added to the end of the list

* Some other purebred that isn't listed here - select ""other"" at the end of the list

Sorry, everyone. The list is kind of a nightmare to update.

&amp;nbsp;  
  
Last night we visited the neighbor and surprisingly the old pup was outside his front door sleeping on a blanket. Up to that point we were still trying to determine whether it was a good idea for us to take him. Once we saw the dog's condition up close we decided right then and there (warning: not for sensitive souls): https://imgur.com/a/5F5KZrD

Keep in mind that my neighbor was home at the time. We were furious but we needed to get the surrender form signed so we restrained ourselves. After a very short conversation (we found out his name is Chico) this asshole neighbor signed the form and we brought Chico to our car. We had blankets and the heater on blast for him. He was scared but immediately calmed down when we started petting and soothing him.

Once we got home we set up a pen in our kitchen, with lots of blankets, space heater, and a bed for him to rest. He started snoring. It's weird but that was incredibly gratifying. A few pics of Chico peeking up at me, then being a snoozeberry, and also our two other dogs Kulfi and Bonnie being curious: https://imgur.com/a/sV8FQ8Q  

Later in the night we found that the dog's condition was pretty bad. I had details here earlier but suffice it to say that we discovered he was suffering from debilitating neurological and physical issues. Chico is a tough doggy though. This morning we took him to the emergency vet. It now seemed that euthanization may be the most merciful option. The Banfield nurses were amazing and took us in immediately. They examined him, corroborated the neurological issues, and said that keeping him alive would be difficult and it wasn't clear that the dog was fully aware of his surroundings anymore.

So, we made the decision to give him the long sleep he badly needed. Chico was a sweet boy who deserved better. While I'm not really sure what I'm feeling right now, at the very least I'm happy that his last night here was spent indoors in a cozy bed with our other pups as his friends, instead of out in the cold. We gave him a big kiss and a hug and took one last photo of him snoring (again) at the vet's: https://imgur.com/a/d42oBTe

4,"[Discussion] I get it, but I'm not giving up.",dogs,t3_aadwsh,6,False,False,aadwsh,"Maybe not discussion as much as just ""non-angry vent."" No reactions needed, thanks for letting me put this out there. 

We rescued an old boy this fall. He's an 11 years young JRT/Rat terrier, and he is equal parts insane, a little misbehaved, and not super cuddly. He's mostly good - knows basic commands, does not root through trash or chew. He is a little funny around people and takes a while to settle down. He cries a low whine if we are busy. He hates being cuddly. He does not play with toys. We've had issues where he is aggressive with us. We're doing the best we can, learning how to avoid situations and change behaviors. It's getting better. But I think this is as good as it will get. 

Just this morning I was organizing his records and saw that we had overlooked a pretty critical detail (actually, the rescue failed to tell us, but neither here nor there). He'd been adopted before. In summer. And then was returned a month later. The notes read ""unrealistic expectations."" And I look at this dog who sometimes gets growly and grumpy, and who won't go near a lap, and... I get it. I do. He's not your ideal. 

Owning a dog was nothing like I thought it would be. But I will not give up on him. Even if he never cuddles, if he never plays fetch...at the end of the day, I am still giving this grumpy old dog a safe place, and I think he and I are both better off because of it. 

I won't give up on you, old grump. &lt;3"
5,[Fluff] First Year of Dog Ownership - Detailed Expenses and Thoughts!,dogs,t3_aac9fh,35,False,False,aac9fh,"#Background
After 20+ years of wanting a dog, we were finally in a place where we had the time and the money to afford a dog. After following various rescues for several years, we knew that we wanted to adopt.

A lot of people have misconceptions about rescue dogs and rescue organizations. We chose a rescue that was foster-based, meaning all dogs were put in foster homes with real families. All dogs are screened at the city animal control for temperament. We liked this rescue because they had a thorough vetting process for both fosters and adopters, and they also had a 2 week 'trial adoption' period to help find the perfect fit.

Bodie was the first dog we saw through the rescue. He lived in a foster home with 2 grade school aged children, and 2 other dogs. We fell in love and adopted Bodie in January of 2018.

#Thoughts
**Challenges**

* He's not *perfect*. It took us a while to come to terms with the fact that he'd never be perfect. Then again - what dog truly is? He is a rescue and likely grew up on the streets. He is sometimes uncomfortable with loud children and especially large men. We have had to invest a LOT of time and money into training.
* Puppy blues are real. He wasn't even a puppy, but for the first few months, he had to be let out on the hour for potty breaks and he HATED his crate. It was hard adjusting to simply being responsible for another living creature and learning to plan our days/weeks in advance. Our schedules are sometimes like Tetris and it truly requires good communication.
* Poop. So much poop. When did he poop? What was the consistency of his poop? The amount of poop we talk about on a daily basis is absurd, but it truly is one of the best way to assess the health of a dog. We had to get comfortable with it REAL fast. There were mistakes made with holes in poop bags. 
* We live in a major metro city and don't have a yard. Walking around in the winter sucks. Walking around in the winter with a dog sucks even more. Prepare to spend 20 minutes each morning putting on jackets and boots for the both of you, and prepare to be pulled on ice for an entire city block because he sees a squirrel and your neighbors didn't salt their side walks.
* Holy hell vet costs are expensive. Who knew that just a basic annual check up with vaccines and heartworm/tick medication would run us well over $500? Where are people paying $200 for vet visits a year?!

**Wins**

* His excitement when we come home makes it all worth it.
* Seeing him blossom and his 'firsts'. His first time playing with a toy. His first time eating a bully stick (and learning that it's not a weapon he will be hit with). His first time asking for belly rubs. His first time jumping into the lake. His first time getting a Christmas present.
* We truly lucked out with a dog that does NOT counter surf, chew things, destroy things, or test any boundaries. You could tape a piece of paper across a doorway and he would cry because it's an impassible barrier.
* He is SO smart and picks up tricks in an instant. We started nosework classes to help build his confidence and to give him something to do in the colder months. We hope to be those crazy dog parents that compete with their dogs in competitions someday.
* Although he's too hyperactive for doggie daycare, he does great with dogs and is superbly tolerant of puppies! We hope to foster dogs in the future, when we have a bigger home.
* Take advantage of local dog groups on Facebook/Reddit and breed specific groups/rescue alumni groups to build a network of dog friends. Not only is it great for play dates, but it's also great to have a network of support when you need to vent. We met many friends this way!

#Expenses
[This year, we spent a whopping $6,150.34](https://i.imgur.com/8uFQjUK.png). Note: we live in a major metro area (Chicago). I will be the first to admit that I am dog obsessed (he's basically my hobby) and spend more on the dog than myself and my partner combined. We are lucky enough to be able to budget and afford doggie luxuries.

[For next year, I'm predicting that it will be closer to $3,000 - $3,500, or $270 - 300 a month](https://i.imgur.com/UBKHY04.png). Next year's expenses will primarily be food, supplements, vet, some boarding, and training. 

If we were to truly minimize costs, I would still expect to budget $1,500 at a MINIMUM to cover basic food and vet costs for a dog.

[Our spend by percentage](https://i.imgur.com/AR3U9eZ.png):

* 'Startup/non-consumable' costs were pretty big for us - about $2k. It included several expensive items like waterproof couch covers to protect from potty accidents/hair on our nicer furniture, a storage bench for all his toys, 2 air purifiers to help our allergies, and a hard crate and soft crate. We spent a LOT on toys, including a CleverPet hub and several enrichment toys. Luckily, he tends to preserve his toys, so these costs will not be incurred next year and should be pretty minimal. 
* 'Service' costs were the largest category, and consisted of boarding, daycare, vet visits, health insurance, and rescue events that we attended. We started traveling less for work in the summer and have more opportunities for work from home, so boarding and daycare will likely drop next year. He started becoming more reactive/protective towards men in early May and we did some training sessions in August to help with his behavior. We would like to continue his training and nosework so costs may stay the same overall. 
* 'Consumable' costs were pretty low in comparison to the first two. We tried several food brands before switching to lamb kibble at Costco, which is pretty cost effective. We also tried several treats at the beginning of ownership but have settled on primarily peanut butter, pumpkin, dental chews, and bully sticks. We buy these on Costco in bulk to help reduce costs. 

If you read this essay, thank you. Questions are welcome!

tl;dr: Dog is expensive. Dog is worth it. 

tl;dr2: I would budget at least $1.5k for a dog for basic expenses, but expect it to increase drastically if you include boarding/daycare and training.

6,"[fluff] My golden asks to go in the back garden, then does just one bark to provoke the neighbour’s dogs that always bark at him while we walk along the street.",dogs,t3_aa8dzg,14,False,False,aa8dzg,"My golden is not a barker. He barks mostly when he’s scared. Or very, very excited. A few weeks ago he started a odd behavior: he would ask to go in the back garden, immediately rush next to the corner, and do a big bark. Just one. At first I thought he was trying to bark at our neighbor’s cat. Then I thought he was answering at dogs barking(we live in a neighborhood where almost everyone keep their dogs outside, even when it’s freezing or very warm. It’s not my case!) Then yesterday I went outside with him, and he obviously barked at nothing. There was silence. Then neighbor’s three dogs suddenly answered, very very angrily. He gets revenge!! While we walk I taught him not to answer or pay attention at dogs barking, as he was becoming fence reactive. Now he’s much better. But he gets revenge while he’s in his garden, provoking these dogs to bark like crazy! We obviously try to block him from this behavior as he got very obsessed. But I found that very cute. "
7,[Help] My mom and sister adopted a pitbull and I fear they might be in over their heads,dogs,t3_aaclll,41,False,False,aaclll,"They adopted an American Pitbull Terrier, he is only 1.5 years old and he came home from a shelter yesterday. 

I am prepared for downvotes because I am going to discuss the potential for aggression in the APBT breed. 

[This old comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3e4rit/_/ctc9tpv?context=1000) was very informative about the breed. If I'm wrong to trust the sources, correct me. 

Anyways, my mom and sister have never owned a dog before, and I'm not sure if they will be able to do proper training, as already they're telling him conflicting messages.. but maybe they can fix that. They have one free training class (haven't gone yet) but I don't know if they'll do more. I hate to say this, but I'm genuinely afraid of this dog. And I know it might make it worse, but idk how to not feel this way.

They just got him yesterday but so far I've noticed following. I just wonder if they're signs of aggression or what: 

•According to his records at the shelter, he sustained an injury on his leg and some bite marks on his chest. He has scarring and his fur has some blood stains that won't go away. My family assumes he was attacked.

•He met another dog. They sniffed eachother for a minute and it seemed good. But after that he began growing and trying to get closer towards the other dog. My sister was holding him by the collar and he made choking sounds. The dog left and he returned to normal.

•My sister touched the funny looking part of his mouth area and he opened his mouth to show his teeth and turned towards her. He stopped when she kind of yelled no.

•Meeting the neighbor dogs through a fence. He doesn't really bark, but he started to make weird growlish sounds after a second and my sister had to hold him back and tell him no.


He doesn't listen very well yet. Is it possible for him to be an easy going safe dog? My sister wants to take him to a dog park and I just imagine a disaster. I don't know how to not be afraid, which might be a separate issue. Is there any recommended tips for dealing with potential aggression? Training tips?

Also, just a disclaimer, I don't have a personal vendetta against the breed, I think they deserve love and happy lives. I just think the dog might need very good training where the owners acknowledge the potential for aggression.. my family currently believes he has the same chance of aggression as any other dog. Idk, I just don't think that's a responsible way to go about it. If I'm wrong, correct me.. Thanks."
8,[RIP] Roxy,dogs,t3_aae9iv,4,False,False,aae9iv,"A few days ago I posted about next steps for cancer. It started last weekend, we noticed my best friend roxy started to have a bit of a gut. At 7 years old i brushed it off that she’s getting older and she’s just got a tummy. Wednesday night she started breathing funny, she snores so it didn’t raise much of an eyebrow so I let it go. Thursday it continued, almost light a sigh/stretch sound when she would exhale. Friday I began to get extremely worried and brought her to the ER. They did X-ray and make me wait 2 hours for results. I’m crying st this point and roxy looks at me with these eyes “it’ll be ok dad” and gives me a kiss. They come back with results and say they can’t see anything and need to ultrasound but couldn’t ultrasound her as their techs are only there certain days. They said I need to get the ultrasound done to see what is going on in her abdomen as it didn’t feel right. Saturday I brought her to another hospital and they did ultrasound and saw a mass. They also saw fluid around her lungs. I said do everything you need to do. They removed 1/2 liter of fluid from around the lungs, went into surgery, to then tell
Me it is at the base of the mesentery gland and could not be removed. Fear and so much emotion overcame my wife and I. I felt helpless. They needed to keep my roxy doodle overnight after the surgery. I called Sunday, and was told she was nauseous and they gotta keep her longer, maybe I can get her Monday Xmas eve. 5 pm Sunday the doctor called saying she’d like to send roxy home. Emotion and tears of happiness filled me as I could have my bub home for Xmas. The doctor said keep an eye on her breathing hopefully fluid doesn’t come back, but we need to wait a few days to find out what the fluid is from and what the mass is. Doodle had a nice Xmas, I went to store Xmas eve buying her lots of canned food and toys. All the above. I stayed home 12/26 to keep an eye on her breathing and make sure she didn’t lick stitches. My wife and I made plans to be positive and not leave roxy home alone and always be around family to be careful to watch her and make sure nothing ruptures, as well as make her life more enjoyable and not lonely when we work. I began to feel positivity maybe the mass isn’t cancer, maybe the fluid won’t come back, if it does I’ll get her on a diuretic, if it’s cancer well do chemo. I didn’t care if we went broke for my roxydoodle. I get a call at 2pm, it’s lymphoma, and it’s also effected a node in her chest cavity. I began to have a breakdown and fear for everything as it’s official.  Fast forward 9pm 12/26 night, her breathing rapidly increases, I say maybe she’s in pain and gave her s painkiller. My wife stays up til 1 am. Wakes me up, her breathing was over 60 breaths per minute and shallow. We decide we won’t take the chance and even if it’s pain, let’s bring her to the ER. Er does a scan, roxy has over 1 liter around her lung, and her belly is getting even bigger. Tears spewing out of my eyes, I can’t put roxy through this pain anymore. To drain it again and have her fill up struggling to breathe her again! She didn’t eat much yesterday either and it was all looking so bad. We make the decision for her own good we don’t want her to struggle anymore. I lost my absolute best friend 12/27 at 2:20 am. I’ve never had a connection like with roxy. She looks st my wife when they inject her, with those same eyes “I love you mom”. And lays down. Her breaths are less and less and I keep kissing her and telling how good of s girl she is. I’m honestly broken and lost a huge part of me this morning. A part I will never have back. I miss my roxy doodle. she was the one who proposed to my wife with the ring. She was there on our wedding day. She truly loved us more than herself, and never would leave our side. I miss her so much and lost part of my heart today. I hope you don’t think I betrayed you rox, I’m so sorry and this was the best 7 years I’ve had with you"
9,[Help] My dog's health is deteriorating and I'm losing my mind,dogs,t3_aag8c9,4,False,False,aag8c9," 

I have an 11 year old King Charles Spaniel. He’s the absolute love of my life. I’m not going to waste time describing this breed to you, but they are the most wonderful dogs there could ever be. 

I got him shortly after my mother died and the bond we’ve created is something I could never picture myself living without. Nevertheless, in the past year or so, he started getting more and more health problems. He can still see very well, but his eyes need daily care and medication. He’s also taking daily medication for his heart disease, which is untreatable and degenerative. To top it all off, we recently discovered that he also has a chronic issue in his spine, that sometimes causes him pain, so he’s losing some of his mobility, meaning that he needs special dog stairs to get up and down the bed. It also means no more belly rubs, no more getting picked up, because he whines and yelps. We’re still testing the medication for that, as we don’t want him to be drugged all the time. Surgery is not an option for neither of his issues.

I am terrified. I always knew that he wasn’t going to be here forever, but it’s getting closer and I don’t know what to do. I still think (or hope) he has at least a couple of years to be with us as he’s still a very active dog for his age, still playful and curious.

But I can’t help but think that I won’t know what to do with myself after he’s gone. We tried getting another dog a couple of months ago, but I couldn’t get attached to him at all and the guilt that I felt because it was like I was trying to replace my dog while he’s still alive was overwhelming. So we ended up rehoming the second dog to another family so he could be happy and loved as he deserved.

I am rational enough to know that this may seem overly dramatic for some people, but for the life of me, I love my dog more than anything in this world and it’s breaking my heart because there’s nothing more that I can do to help him. He’s been by my side, my sole comfort during some very difficult things in my life, so losing my right arm seems like a better choice than not having him with me. It’s selfish and self destructive, but I don’t know how to control myself.

If anyone has any advice or has gone through something similar, please help me. I’m getting desperate and I don’t have anyone close to me that can relate.

Thank you! "

Dog has ""needs to meet other dogs in the house"" on his kennel card. When asked, staff members, save one, have no clue how he is with other dogs. The only one who does says he will kill any other small animal, dogs included, on sight.

Anyway, I adopted him ~3 years ago. I’m just as obsessed with everything he does and think he’s irresistibly adorable just as much as I did 3 years ago when I took him home! Whenever he gives me puppy eyes, I melt. And he does this almost every day when he wants to cuddle (which is almost all the time).

I’m convinced my dog placed some sort of brainwashing chip in my brain because it must be weird to think a dog is *this* cute. Does anyone else feel this way about their fur baby(ies)? 

I need some other overwhelming cute stories!

14,[fluff] lost my dog's leash whilst on walk - little man did me proud,dogs,t3_aa0u90,72,False,False,aa0u90,"Went on a looooong old walk with my boy this morning along a canal path. It's generally pretty empty save a few bikes and other dog walkers. He's reliable off leash but I always hook him up when we pass roads/other animals/on leash dogs as he still gets excited over exciting things. 

Anyway, we hit the 6 mile mark and were coming up to a road so I called him back to me, reached for the leash around my neck... And it wasn't there! 

We went back on ourselves to where I last used it but I just couldn't find it. I decided to head to the nearest pub where I knew they had dogs. We ended up walking over 2 miles past fields of cows and sheep, cyclists and a very excited puppy on leash and my boy stayed by my side the whole time! 

It was like the most intense training session EVER! I tried to limit my commands so I didn't overload him, but it was like he knew something was up so was super responsive to everything! Walking next to me past livestock, sitting next to me while cyclists went by and waiting to be released to greet the puppy. 

I WAS SO PROUD 

Gave him lots of roast potatoes when we got to the pub. 

It was great. 

Edit: here he is early on on our walk&gt; https://imgur.com/a/D1ZJtvK

Edit 2: Just in response to a couple of comments &gt; We live in the UK where dogs are only required to be on lead in areas where there is a specific by-law. Because of this we don't have dedicated off-leash areas, like dog parks, and we're expected to share public space. This means if your dog is going to get any time off leash, it will be in public space. This doesn't mean dogs are running everywhere, but that parks, woodlands etc will be used by dog owners to exercise off leash. I do my best to be a responsible dog owner and ensure he is under control at all times. We've worked really hard to get to a point where he could walk off leash. Spent over a year using a long line etc. Even put him back on it when he started scavenging a few months back. Although today turned out ok, it could have been worse and I've learnt my lesson about bringing a spare lead. But, DAMN did he impress me. "

Not to mention, he has been playing with the other dog we’ve been staying with almost the whole time so hes been over excited and basically nonstop ever since arriving. 

Last night he drank a lot and panted throughout the night. Even did this weird gagging thing in his sleep a few times. 

Today so far he has pooped 4x (he usually poops 2x a day). It is formed but still soft and a light brown-yellow color. However he is in a good mood, been active, and very happy. Im just concerned about the excessive thirst and stool changes! Any idea of what could be going on? My fiancé keeps saying hes fine hes fine but i can be a bit of a hypochondriac when it comes to my and my pet’s health. 

Any thoughts? "
17,Situation [Help],dogs,t3_aafl2z,1,False,False,aafl2z," So, I have two dogs, one is a cream retriever (Moses) and one is a french bulldog (Chip) (tremendous size difference obviously). Usually they're best buds, constantly together, play together, sleep together, always by each others sides. Just recently, within the past 3 or 4 days my retriever, the much bigger dog, seems to have become deathly afraid of my french bulldog. Whenever they are both in the house Moses will run away and hide from Chip. He'll cower in a corner or run up to my room and refuse to go downstairs. Moses will be on edge, watching to see if Chip is coming, and if he does, he runs to my side and cries while I pet him. I'm really not sure what to do nor do I really know what started this. Of course they rough house around and maybe Chip had bit him too hard one time but regardless this kind of behavior is very odd for them. This had just caused a general disturbance around the house because we have to be separated with both of them and I personally am a bit afraid to leave them alone together because if Moses gets too afraid, I wouldn't be surprised if he attacked Chip, which, due to the size difference, could end badly. Any help would be greatly appreciated! "
18,[help] potential partially torn CCL,dogs,t3_aafcxc,2,False,False,aafcxc,"My 5 year old female pit bull has been limping for a month. She has had limps before (extremely active dog/extremely long and strenuous hikes) and x-rays were negative for any breaks or torn ligaments. She usually gets back to 100% within a week. This time she was still favoring her leg after a month. While the limp has improved in the course of a month she would still favor it at times.

&amp;#x200B;

I took her to the vet today and he thinks that it might be a partial ligament tear of her CCL. He gave me Gabapentin and Vetprofen. After reading up on the former, not sure if the side effects are worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

He said that if I wanted to get an x-ray it should be under sedation. I'm reluctant to do this.

  
If it is indeed a partial torn CCL, what is the best course of action? My initial research indicates that surgery, while not necessary, helps to prevent further injury to the knee area. It also helps to prevent potential issues from the change in gait to the other legs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty blown about this because I consider my dog to be invincible physically. She's tough and hardy, never shows signs of being in pain, a sentiment shared by the vet. Like I said before, she is very active and in remarkable shape. I would hate for this limp to be permanent.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with surgery, it doesn't seem like a 100% recovery is possible.

What have you all seen that gives the best chances of a full recovery from a torn CCL?"

I've read a lot of material on the subject matter but I have some questions that cropped up tonight and unfortunately my vet's office is closed(plus I'm fairly certain my questions don't count as urgent). 

Quick background: I have a litter of 5 Great Dane puppies, 10 days old. They're all hearty little sucklers, and momma dog has been doing a good job thus far. I have been tracking their weights and they're all steadily gaining weight(with an average gain of 1.5lbs in the last week). Now from everything I read they should still have their eyes shut and not be all that mobile, except half of them have opened their eyes today and 2 of them are already holding themselves up completely and walking(not well but definitely walking not crawling). Is this okay? 

TLDR: My puppies seem to be developing faster than expected, there are no signs that any are sick or unwell in anyway. Just wanted to check that this was okay."

Since it's infrequent she told us to give her half of a child's dose of robitussin dm every six hours as needed. I've been to 3 pharmacies and I couldn't find any robitussin that wasn't just for adults or children. So I bought children's robitussin dm honey flavor and was going to give her 5ml when she needs it (this is half of the children aged 10-12 dose).

The other is now extremely pregnant, like really really, and I have an appointment for her to get spayed on Monday. I feel very conflicted. I know there are so many dogs needing homes already, they will be anesthetized during the surgery, and we do not need like 8 dogs to take care of. We are scraping by financially, have an out of town family trip planned for mid-February, and have so many things to figure out regarding our son’s school and medical needs.

23,[help] I am dogsitting my friend's non-housebroken dog,dogs,t3_aacuuf,4,False,False,aacuuf,"I am dog-sitting my friend's little 5yr old dachshund mix.  I already knew that my friend was not the most responsible with her dog. She leaves him home all day and doesn't have him walked. I have never seen her walk the dog and I used to live next door to her. I also vaguely knew he wasn't completely potty trained. 

This dog is completely NOT housebroken. He's peed on my dog's bed, my bed, my couch, and in my dog's crate. He sees furniture/carpets as places to relieve himself I think. I texted her to ask about the dog's potty skills and she said, ""well you can't leave him loose in a room."" She told me to keep him in his crate which makes me sad.

 I let him run around the yard for a bit, but it's too cold outside for him to stay there and he seems pretty scared of it. He's in his crate, which is more like a carrier container and really, really small.  

I am just about to take him on a walk, but he is really poorly trained and pretty reactive to just about everything. I feel like I just don't know what to do at all. 

To be honest, this is changing my opinion of my friend. Her dog seems pretty neglected and untrained. Last night, she told me it was fine to put him in his crate at 7 pm and take him out at 9 am. That's 14 hours in the crate! 

How do I handle this? she only gave me two pee pads, which I don't think he knows how to use. I guess I will be trying to let him out every hour? I am really at a loss about what to do. "

25,"[Breed] Help my find my perfect dog breed, please!",dogs,t3_aah97p,0,False,False,aah97p,"**Introduction**

**1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

This is not my first dog. I grew up with German Shepherds, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and Australian Shepherds.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

My family always went through breeders in the past, I like the idea of a rescue dog, I’m open to either.

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

Here’s where things get complicated. I teach a lot of theatre/drama/dance to children and would like a “theatre dog”, one that is absolutely great with kids. I’m a trauma survivor, and a relatively petite sized human, so the idea of a larger dog who might make strangers think twice before approaching sounds ideal. I want a dog that wants to be with me and can jump into my family. Must be trainable and bonus points if I can get this dog to join the kids onstage for shows &lt;3 I also have large birds (Who have been able to hold their own with all previous dogs) so a dog that can quickly learn to leave the birds alone would be safest. (They are never out together unsupervised)

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I like the idea of larger dogs, Rhodesian sized and up, but I’m not opposed to a dog I can carry if we think, personality wise, it’ll be a better fit. I’ve got a big yard, and a decent sized living space. 

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Obedience for sure, agility could be fun (I did that with my Aussie). A dog that is comfortable with children and activity around without necessarily feeling the need to join in is a great fit. Oh and I love a good hike! 

**Care Commitments**

**6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

I would like to take my dog to work (Theatre) with me and spend a good about of time with my dog. 

**7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

I walk about 1 1/2 hours per day already, could do more. 

**8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

A couple times a week myself, groomers monthly isn’t out of the question. 

**Personal Preferences**

**9) What size dog are you looking for?**

I love larger dogs, but, again, not opposed to a smaller one if the personality is right.

**10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

The more quiet, the better. Shedding is fine, slobber makes me kind of sad, but I'm willing to put up with it if all else works.

**11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

My dog will always be in secure areas off leash. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

**12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Snuggly please

**13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

I’m open

**14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

I’m fine with a Dog that is suspicious of door knocking and entering the yard. A protective streak is a good thing in my book. At the theatre it’s very important that my dog is safe to be around children. 

**15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

No.

**16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

As long as I know, I can manage it. 

**Lifestyle**

**17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Rarely.

**18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

Hypoallergenic if possible, for the kids sake, but not totally necessary.

**19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

I have large birds and very senior Australian Shepherd 

**20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Yes, ages 8+

**21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

I own my home 

**22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

Southern CA: not sure of bans.

**23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

It’s summer year round ;) Summer 90F, Winter 70F

**Additional Information and Questions**

**24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

Thank you!"
26,[Discussion] Why is my dog bathroom shy?,dogs,t3_aah86h,0,False,False,aah86h,"It's an odd question and in all the dogs I've owned I've never had one quite like this guy.

He will only poop if I, personally, walk him. He refuses to poop if my boyfriend (we got this dog together and he's just as much a part of my dogs life as I am) or the dog walker take him. I sometimes work 11 hour shifts with and an hour commute on each end and he will hold it all 13 hours until I get home! 
Sometimes I'll take him on a walk after a long work day and he will poop 3 separate times because he's been holding it.

28,[HELP] My dog has a rash on his groin area that looks like roast beef? Wtf is it?,dogs,t3_aah3s3,5,False,False,aah3s3,"Our dog is a Lab and Doberman mix, more lab than anything. He’s never had a rash before. We recently took him to the vet for a lump he had. We thought it was cancer, but it was just a fatty bump on his leg. He also had a little rash in his groin area. The vet said it was a ring worm and gave us an antibiotic to kill it. He finished that and after the red circle disappeared, he has kept licking at it for a few days.

We grabbed a medicated spray for itchy or hot spots. That didn’t help. A bath hasn’t helped. He’s been licking at it for days now and we’ve never had rash problems before. We did move to a new house with a backyard that he can roam in about 7 or 8 months ago, but this whole situation started maybe 2 weeks ago.

Nothing has changed other than the backyard (again, over 6 or 7 months before the rash). We’ve already spent around $500 at the vet and I’d prefer not to go back, but he’s obviously miserable and I don’t want to be cruel.

The rash started out as reddish and has since begun to look almost like... forgive me... roast beef? It doesn’t smell, and it’s not dry. It’s kind of sticky looking/feeling. He’s constantly trying to lick it. It’s right where his balls used to be. Does anyone know what it is or what it sounds like? And for the love of dogs, how to fix it without going to the vet?!"

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* For safety purposes I won't say my city, but I live in southern Sweden. Hybrids such as Czehcoslovak wolfdogs are legal since the 4th generation is free from wild animal trace or whatever it's called, but you need to take a few lessons in wild animal behavior and breeding.

33,[HELP] Looking for alternative to dog park.,dogs,t3_aabfik,32,False,False,aabfik,"This happened yesterday, however I just puked stressing about it this morning.

I got home before sundown yesterday. Not something that typically happens, so I decided to reward myself and treat my dog, “Daisy”, to an afternoon at the dog park. Daisy sits next to me in my truck and becomes visibly more excited as we near the park. It’s easily her favorite place in the world. As I park, Daisy starts to “push” me towards the door. As we walk towards the dog run, she wants to pull me faster, but she does her best not to, all the way to the gate. I bring her into the buffer pen, take off her leash, and open the gate.

Immediately she started having fun.
Daisy went and said “hi” to every dog and half the people in the pen. Three black labs and a beagle start to chase her as she runs around the pen. The owner of the beagle begins to shout at his dog, because anytime it catches up to Daisy, it starts eating her ass. Daisy doesn’t seem to notice the beagle or any of the other dogs chasing her. She only has eyes for the brown lab on the other side of the fence. She barks, wags her tail and try’s to get the brown lab to run up and down the fence with her, (Daisy’s favorite game). After a few minutes, the beagle owner is tired of watching his dog give mine a rim job and puts his leash on and drags him towards the gate to leave. A married couple decided to leave as well and put their two black labs on leashes and start walking to the gate. Daisy then takes notice of the labs and approaches them to investigate.

Daisy got too close for comfort to one of the labs. It snapped and bit repeatably, lunged against the leash and tried pinning Daisy to he ground by her neck. The woman panicked, pulling on the leash and fell onto her back. Daisy stayed low and backed up, retreating without taking her eyes off the lab. Momentary chaos as everyone grabs their dogs, breaking up the fur pile the commotion attracted.

The woman quickly gets back on her feet, fire-engine red in the face, wild-eyed and unloads a flurry of curses at Daisy and I. She screams that she is going to kill my dog, that she is going to wring her by the neck, that all pit-bulls are no good and should be exterminated. The husband chimes in and says that my dog is no good, to get it out of the park and shoot it.
I’m a little in shock, the only thing I can think to say is, “Are you seriously talking to me?” The husband confirms that, yes, he is talking to me. I immediately retort, “Your dog attacked mine!” The woman exclaimed that she was afraid for her poor baby and she thought she was going to get her face ripped off. I looked at her dog, then back to Daisy, “Is your dog bleeding? Because mine is!” Daisy had small puncture wounds on the top of her head, right side of her face, and the nape of her neck. The woman protested that her dog was wounded too. But after looking her dog over, could not find a scratch on him. I explained that her dog felt threatened when Daisy approached and because her dog was leashed and couldn’t run away, defended itself and her. Another dog owner came to our defense and even berated the woman for leashing her dogs in the pen.

At this point the woman began to calm down and apologized profusely while shaking my hand. She explained that her dog is her “child”, that she was scared for her “baby” and that she was so scared that she wet herself, and that’s why she overreacted. I try not to react as I realize why her handshake was so moist. I didn’t want to upset her after making so much progress de-escalating the situation. I told her I understood why she was scared and why she reacted the way she did as she shook my hand again. The woman then apologized to the parents in the park for her outburst in front of their small children. She assured me that “we’re all good” as she and her husband left the park.

I’m still holding on to Daisy’s collar as I consider leaving the park myself. I ask all the other patrons if they are ok with Daisy and I staying. They assured me that Daisy was fine to stay and that woman and her husband were out of line. I let Daisy go and watch carefully as she plays with three other dogs, sniffs at a five year old boy then licks a girl of about ten as she gets petted. I start coming down off the adrenaline as I wash my hands and everyone else relaxes and goes back to watches their dogs play. About an hour goes by before a police officer shows up. The officer approaches the fence and I walk up to meet her. The officer asked if everyone was ok. I told her everyone was ok. She asked a couple of questions and I did my best to explain what happened. One of the other dog handlers comes up to us and confirmed my story, adding, “That bitch was drunk and acting crazy before his dog showed up.” The officer’s response was something to the effect of “I figured there was another side to this.” After asking again if everyone was ok, the officer left. Thirty minutes later, the sun dipped into the horizon and I took Daisy home.

I’m seriously considering swearing off dog parks all together. This is the third time Daisy has been attacked by another dog then blamed because she is half pit. The second time the cops have been called, (the first time was because she got loose in the neighborhood for 10 minutes). And the third time someone has threatened killing my dog for being a vicious attack animal that needs to be made extinct.! /s
Oh, and this is the only incident that involved all three scenarios!

This will be a non issue soon. I’m going to buy some land next year, put a trailer on it, and build my dream home away from the city.
Should I just keep my dog away from the parks till then? What are some other options?


TL;DR I took my dog to the park. My dog gets bit, then threatened with  genocide, and I get pee on me. Cops get called."
34,[UPDATE] My dog has had diarrhea for over 2 weeks.....,dogs,t3_aa63mf,16,False,False,aa63mf,"You can check my history for the previous post. I'm unsure how to link it on mobile.

My 9 1/2 year old bulldog was being treated for IBD after having diarrhea for over 2 weeks, but yesterday she seemed to get really uncomfortable as the day went on. I was going to wait and take her to her regular vet this morning but I couldn't stand to see her in pain and her belly seemed like it was swelling, so we took her to the E-vet.
They did a full panel of blood work, tested her thyroid, and did abdominal xrays to see if they could find anything. He did tell us that the xray showed one of her hips had no cartilage left, so she was likely in quite a but of pain from that (completely unrelated). Her white blood cell count was up so he knew she had some kind of infection which the metrinadozole (prescribed by her regular vet) wasn't helping with. We waited over an hour for a radiologist to look at her xrays because he wanted to be sure before coming to us with any news. It was abnormal, however he couldn't tell us exactly what was wrong. He said it could be cushings, cancer, allergies, or a number of things. He said she needed strong IV antibiotics asap and to be treated quickly because her abdomen was filling with fluid.
IF she made it through that, there would likely be much more extensive testing costing us in the thousands of dollars. We couldn't put her through all of that.
Without an official diagnosis, we faced the incredibly difficult decision to end her suffering. I could tell she was in pain. We went next door to the gas station and bought her a hot dog. She ate it happily with a wagging ""nub"" despite her pain. I held her until her last breath. She was my heart dog. She'd been with my husband and I for 95% of our relationship and 1/3 of my entire life. I don't know how my life will ever be normal again. It was so quiet last night without her snoring or shuffling her blankets around or crawling under the bed so we couldn't nudge her when she snored too loud.....
I am absolutely devastated but am trying to take comfort in the fact that she isn't in any more pain. I loved her so much and will never forget the unconditional love she gave to us.
RIP Tonka. You were the best dog in the entire world."

36,"[Breed] I've wanted a dog my whole life, but every breed I look into implies my lifestyle probably won't ever fit with that of any sort of canine companion, please help!",dogs,t3_aaei3n,14,False,False,aaei3n,"**Introduction**

* &amp;#x200B;

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?   

&gt;This will be my first time personally owning a dog. Every other dog I have owned has been a family dog (a Marmaduke Great Dane, a Rottweiler, a black lab, and a husky mix) all of which (save for the Rottweiler) lived in an apartment with my mother. They were primarily trained by my parents, although I have trained a dog I was babysitting to sit and heal using reward based training with treats.

* 2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?   

&gt;No preference anymore. Initially my preference was to rescue however the application process kept weeding me out because I am young and my backyard isn't fenced in (or so I'm told) so I'm planning to go with a breeder.

* 3) Describe your ideal dog.   

&gt;My ideal dog would be one that can be left home for 4-8 hours of the day. If I need to come home at lunch that's fine, but the 8 hours would be more ideal. On the other hand, the dog has to be smart enough that it can be trained to be off leash for things like hiking, and camping, and playing in the backyard; so high energy as opposed to low energy would also be necessary because I'm looking for an adventure companion for things like: hiking, fishing, camping, skiing (cross country), snowshoeing, kayaking, snowmobiling, four wheeling, etc. Something that is okay with the cold (because I really enjoy winter activities) and the outdoors in general...

* 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?   

&gt;I've been looking at husky, lab, retrievers, Shepherds, and the like... I would really love a mutt though. I was looking at these breeds because they're smart and have a lot of energy, but also because I like the general aesthetic of them and their size.

* 5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?   

&gt;I would like my dog to be able to walk off leash with me, and ring a bell when it goes outside. Being able to run and wrestle and play with him/her without aggression is ideal as well... and of course, coming when their name is called. Honestly, if I could teach him/her to push a button to come in and out of the outdoors, I wouldn't feel so bad about leaving it at home while I'm at work.

&amp;#x200B;

**Care Commitments**

* 6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?   

&gt;Ideally I would spend about 20 minutes outside with him in the morning before I leave for work, and then a few hours after dinner. On the weekends of course I can devote more time, and considering I would like to take him hiking and such, the more time the merrier at that point, but I'd need to be able to spend less time with them on the weekdays

* 7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?   

&gt;Let's say about 2 to 3 hours. This could be anything from running around and playing in the backyard with them, throwing sticks, or going on hikes and other such activities

* 8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?   

&gt;For brushing, every other day would be ideal to give myself a break in between, but I'm willing to do maintenance like nail trimming and cleaning, however fur trimming I would take them to a groomer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Preferences**

* 9)	What size dog are you looking for?   

&gt;Medium to large. I was looking at a Pyrenees for a little while but perhaps 3 x 40lb bags of food a month is a bit much (that's my only concern with a larger dog)

* 10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?   

&gt;I can handle lots of shedding and barking... not so much slobber. Slobber is okay outside in the heat, but not so much in the air conditioned house. Our great dane was constantly slobbering and would shake his head and get slobber all over the walls and ceiling, I'm not sure I could go through that again...

* 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?   

&gt;Very important (of the utmost)

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

* 12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?   

&gt;No preference although they won't be allowed to sleep with me in bed, or cuddle with me on the couch so probably less snugly...

* 13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?   

&gt;Honestly I want both. One that's willing to spend time with me and happy to do so, but that can also be left alone at home... I know that's a tough one... if I had to choose, then I suppose one that's willing to do it's own thing so that it isn't miserable at home while I'm at work...

* 14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

&gt;I would like them to bark to let me know there's someone there, and to maybe scare off potential intruders, but otherwise I think it's fairly necessary that they are cautious with strangers but friendly...

* 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?   

&gt;Honestly, aggression is the one thing I can't handle.

* 16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?   

&gt;I of course would like to avoid separation anxiety but I can manage it. The only thing I can't deal with is aggressive and possessive behaviors (that is, if I try to take something from it's mouth, I don't want it snarling and biting at me)

**Lifestyle**

* 17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?   

&gt;Weekly anywhere between 4 to 8 hours, weekends barely ever.

* 18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

&gt;My spouse has basically the same preferences as me, and we will have equal involvement in caring for the dog. Sometimes I might take the dog out in the morning, sometimes he might, etc.

* 19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?   

&gt;I don't have any pets and I don't plan on getting any other pets other than perhaps another dog to keep each other company when I'm away.

* 20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?   

&gt;No

* 21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?   

&gt;I rent currently, probably for about another year or so but there are no restrictions in the lease and my landlord has given me the go-ahead for whatever type of dog I wish, as long as I can clean up after it.

* 22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?   

&gt;Canada, Ontario, I believe there is a current ban on pit-bulls and similar breeds.

* 23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?   

&gt;Summer: 25 Celsius, Winter: -20 up to -40 Celsius

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Information and Questions**

* 24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.   

&gt;In order of preference and more simplistically my requirements would probably go as such: not aggressive, intelligent (to be trained off leash), size (medium to large), high energy for adventures but self sufficient when left alone while I'm at work. It might be good to note that I live on the outskirts of town, a non-busy street, and I have 3 acres in my backyard that leads into some forest.

* 25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

37,Headstrong vs. Eager to Please [Discussion],dogs,t3_aad4np,28,False,False,aad4np,"So just sort of an open discussion pertaining to something I'm a bit curious about.

It seems that most people prefer eager to please dogs, which is understandable for novice dog owners who aren't prepared to deal with a headstrong dog, but any thoughts on this trend in general? I find that I prefer headstrong dogs that are, ie. Huskies, Akitas, etc. I personally find it much more rewarding to have a dog that can think for itself and make decisions accordingly (worded poorly, every animal thinks for itself naturally. Re. I find it rewarding to find out what creative or specific motivator these dogs have in order to encourage them to learn commands), opposed to dogs who strive only to please their owner. I find that often times headstrong dogs become fairly reliable in responding to commands as their trust and loyalty is earned and reciprocated, which is all the better. Any different views on this or just stories of your pups in general in regards to this?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I worded this veryyy poorly, apologies for that! This isn't insulting eager to please dogs(or biddable, as someone kindly suggested instead. Which does make more sense) as they make up the better majority of working and sporting dogs. I fear for the day someone tries to turn my husky into a service dog lol. They're vital to numerous fields and activities and just as respectable. My statement was more or less as a matter of personal preference, as someone who does not need a working or sporting dog, but more or less a companion. The intelligent bit was also misguided at best, as others have pointed out, how biddable a dog is wouldn't determine how intelligent they are. I posted this with the intention of learning more on the subject and I'm attempting to somewhat update this post as I learn. :) Don't know the rules on linking articles in this, but u/shiplesp linked a great article on the subject!

38,[Discussion] Did anyone else’s dog get sick (vitamin D toxicity) due to the recent dog food recall?,dogs,t3_aaec4f,2,False,False,aaec4f,"[link to FDA’s list of affected brands](https://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/newsevents/ucm627485.htm)

One of our dogs got very sick from eating Nutrisca food. I haven’t seen much discussion about this recall other than [this general warning posted to this sub](https://reddit.app.link/6gkvNtbC1S), so I’m wondering how many other dogs were affected. 

As for our dog, he recently received a clean bill of health! He’s still not back to his normal self but we hope that will come with time. The dog food company has agreed to paying for all vet bills, including future bills related to the vitamin D toxicity. They are even reimbursing us for the last several bags of dog food we purchased. Overall we’re happy with how they’ve handled this situation. Thankful that the company seems to be full of genuine folks who truly want the best for their customers and pets.

Is anyone else going through this? If so, how is your dog doing? "
39,[discussion] subscription box for dogs,dogs,t3_aagb44,3,False,False,aagb44,"Good evening dog lovers!

I am creating a subscription box for dogs and am looking for some advice or opinions from the very people who buy them! 

Based on the current available boxes for dogs. What could be improved upon? What would be something really useful, fun or interesting you'd like to see in the box? 

Is there anything you feel is missing from the current market? 

Is there something you do not like about the current boxes (be specific) why and how could this be improved? 

What if there were better options (more personability for the dog) 

Would you like to see clothing articles in the box? Collars, scarves, costumes? 

Could the box itself be improved in some way? 

Would you like to see different products variation in the box (rather than 1 toy, 2 treat bags and 2 chews?)

Deals with other dogs businesses for being subscribed? 

I can go on forever with questions but that's why I'm writing here! Please give me your honest opinions on the current market, what it's lacking, what it's doing well and how if it could be improved upon! Anything and everything you can give me will be greatly appreciated and maybe you'll see those changes happen in the upcoming box I'm creating. 


Thanks

40,[Help] Best first time dog that looks like a wolf?,dogs,t3_aag6n8,12,False,False,aag6n8,"So I'm soon turning 18 in a year and I have always wanted a dog that looks like a wolf, preferably a Siberian Husky or Alaskan Malamute, or maybe an East/West Siberian Laika, as my mother's cousin owned an East Siberian (sadly she, as in the dog passed away a couple of years ago). She was an unpredictable dog, I have to admit, but she was loving and didn't try to attack me. This may seem like a bold statement since I only met her twice, but from what I remember she knew the rules. So anyways, what dog should I get when I turn 18 and can afford one on my own? Suberian Husky? Siberian Laika? Or Alaskan Malamute? Any other recommendations?

41,"[help] sister got a dog over christmas from her MIL, sister thinks the dog is a pitbull which is illegal where they live. need help determining the breed",dogs,t3_aa8aht,56,False,False,aa8aht,"as title says ^ my sister got a surprise present from her mother in law over christmas, a brand new puppy. which wouldnt be that bad if my sister had any idea of the background of the dog, but her MIL only has extremely limited information. she told my sister that she found the puppy off of craigslist and messaged the number listed, and they talked and he said that the breed was a “mini aussie mixed border collie” and then sent pictures of both parents and the puppy itself, with no further information except that the puppy was around 7 weeks old (an obvious lie.) when he had come over to give her the dog he insisted he had to leave almost immediately after coming and getting the money, only saying that the dog could eat solid food before leaving (but not actually providing anything himself)

so here’s the real kicker: after my sister found out about this she was obviously upset at her MIL for not only buying a dog but without talking to her about it first; so she tried to contact the same number to get more information, but the number was completely cut almost like he disappeared off the face of the earth. she figured it was because of the age as the dog was obviously not 6 weeks and was a lot younger, but as the dog is getting older now she’s starting to get very suspicious that the breed is also a reason he’s no longer communicating. 

[here](https://imgur.com/gallery/zOqo526) are some pics. in order: the picture of the puppy sent by him, the pictures of the parents, and the puppy now. my sister said she’s slightly worried now that it might actually be a pitbull puppy, since pitbulls are illegal in denver. we’re not sure why anyone would sell a different breed than listed but we can only chalk it up to christmas madness. but please any help determining the breed at all is greatly appreciated we could really use any help we can get (or a redirect if this isnt the right place to post about this. thanks!)

TL;DR sisters MIL bought her a dog over christmas from shady craigslist ad, sister is furious and tries to get more info, number is now cut and sister is suspicious of the dog actually being a pitbull (illegal in denver) instead of the listed breed "
42,"[Discussion] [Update] I rescued three dogs, but a fourth was kept in inhumane conditions.",dogs,t3_aaahvl,14,False,False,aaahvl,"You may remember my post, or maybe not. About two months ago I rescued three dogs, Olive (mom, mini poodle) Boris &amp; Doris (son/daughter poodle x chihuahua). My coworkers mother was keeping these three tiny dogs outside in a shed. They'd been there for their whole lives (2-5 years) and had no medical treatment ever. 

I took them on the condition that they were her only dogs, ie ill fix your problem for you but I'm taking them all (her mom wanted to keep one, I know they're her dogs but you don't get to treat animals like that and then keep them, in my opinion). 

These dogs are the best dogs I've ever had, excluding my heart dog. I've rescued a lot of dogs, but Ive never met such sweet, smart dogs. They're so great. I just found out that she kept one back, their brother who was ""cute"". 

He lived outside, and since I took the others they put him inside. He stays in a crate 23 hours a day. I'm livid. Luckily, my coworker told me because her mother was wanting to get rid of him. I told her to bring him to me. 

I can't believe this. It kills me. I know it's weird, but I view him as *my* dog. I have his mother and littermates. They sleep in my bed, and when they go in a crate its only for a few hours. They have toys, great food, and lots of love. And he's suffering. I have spent hundreds of dollars on their care, and I agreed to do it because I was rescuing *all* of them. 

I can't stand the thought of him suffering. I hope they bring him soon. It was pretty tough to get the other three brought to me, I don't know why obviously they don't like dogs much.

44,why is my dogs nose always wet? [discussion],dogs,t3_aadzo9,2,False,False,aadzo9,
45,[Help] Info on the relationship between puppy tolerance of restraint and resource guarding thresholds,dogs,t3_aabu8y,5,False,False,aabu8y,"I found an article about Resource Guarding (RG), located here as a PDF: https://www.gths.ca/wp-content/uploads/Article-Resource-Guarding-Dec-2-2014.pdf. 

The article discusses early signs of a low RG threshold. In particular interest to me is the following, emphasis added:

&gt;These signs are often overlooked because for the most part these behaviours are normal; puppies need to learn tolerance to body handling, restraint, etc. **However, in the case of a puppy with a low resource guarding threshold these behaviours are more pronounced and approach the excessive end of the scale.**

This article is the only one that I can find that correlates puppy unwillingness to be restrained with a low RG threshold. I want to find more information about this relationship. 

I emailed the author but she is very busy and told me to look into Jean Donaldson's book ""Mine!"" and Steven R. Lindsay’s text series volume 2, which I guess is ""Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Vol. 2: Etiology and Assessment of Behavior Problems"".  

I've read ""Mine!"" and don't remember the relationship being discussed. I downloaded the Lindsay book and ""resource guarding"" doesn't appear in the text at all, but he does say this at the beginning of the aggression chapter: 

&gt; Although most dogs are presented for treatment at 1 to 3 years of age, incipient signs of a developing problem are frequently observed in young puppies, often prior to 4 months of age.

Skimming the rest of the aggression chapter, I don't see anything else similar to what I'm looking for, but lots of great information on ""low threshold"" as it relates to aggression in general. I can draw the implicit connections between what I'm reading and what I'm looking for, but am seeking more explicit info.

Anyone know of any material that explores the relationship between puppy restraint tolerance and low RG thresholds further? "

49,[Help] Younger Dog attacked Older Dog,dogs,t3_aac7x7,0,False,False,aac7x7,"I wanted to get input on a sitatuation that happened a while ago with my 2 years old (at the time) Bernese/Lab cross. We got her as a pup and she ended up with parvo the next day. We spent weeks and tons of time and money and she survived it. Due to complications she ended up getting vaccinated later on and training took longer as well as socializing. From a pup she lived with our 10 year old lab (most pleasant dog). They never had a problem with eachother other than the occassional snarls from the lab to get puppy to back off. Fast forward a year, my bfs golden and my bernese are best friends, tons of play dates, etc. Now she is particular about certain dogs, so we always have her on leash for her safety and other dogs, don't take her to off leash, etc but she still gets walked 2-3 times a day and what not.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, when my mom and I were home alone eating sushi, our then 12 year old lab was begging for food. My mom turned to her and said 'nope, out, stop begging!'. All of the sudden the then 2 year old Bernese out of nowhere attacked the older dog. Grabbed the scruff of her neck and shook and growled. We were able to seperate them and get 2 year old outside but were a bit shook. After everything had calmed down, we let her back in and she was acting weird. Older dog would be in a room and she would sit at edge of room staring at her etc. I went to see older dog to see how she was doing and again, pup attacked her. I ended up getting bit in the process. Now, we seperated them after that as we have a basement appartment so pup was down there and older still had run of the house and always basket muzzled pup when they were together. Even with the muzzle, pup would sometimes lunge and growl at her for no reason. We got both checked at vet, pup was fine, older one had some health issues and passed a month later.

I continuously play this whole thing in my head wondering what had happened. I live with my fiance now and the Bernese (4 years old now) and a golden (3 years) who are best friends.

52,"[discussion] Breeder Refund - no receipt, no sales tax, recently moved locations, no contract copy",dogs,t3_aaf0cx,4,False,False,aaf0cx,"So I misjudged and blinded myself and ended up purchasing an adult dog from a back yard breeder. She didn't show me the contract until we met. The contract said the health guarantee was voided if NuVet was not given regularly, but I managed to avoid that by saying I'd prefer to consult a vet before promising to buy vitamins, and she wrote that in. Here's the big thing, **she didn't give me a copy of the contract after signing**. I thought there was a copy in the folder she gave me of his papers, but it's not there. **I** **paid through Venmo**, and **she** **didn't give me a receipt for the dog** (I got a receipt for the deposit a month earlier, also paid through Venmo). **She didn't mention anything about sales tax in the price.** She has recently moved from **California to Texas**. She lives north of Dallas, but **traveled to Corsicana** to trade the dog, where she likely has no license/etc to sell there. 

She told me this dog has no barking habits, no aggressive habits, no health issues. Vet says his teeth are in horrible shape even though he's less than two years, and he had 4 total shots and no boosters for rabies/parvo. We're setting up blood tests and urinalysis and I'll be dropping off some stool for testing today. We've only had him a few days, and I'm aware that there is a period for him to grow used to his new surroundings, but I don't think I can handle his behavior to everyone else. He is growling and barking aggressively at everyone in the family but me, and won't even eat treats they toss his way. He's doing a weird gasping/coughing thing when he's upset, and I am setting another vet visit for that. When he pees, he does it while walking on a handstand and it gets pee all over his fur on his belly and legs. He is intact, and I have set up an appointment to neuter him. I can't get him to learn sit or his name. He has pretty bad separation anxiety. Some family members are not happy with the shedding, so there's a lot of tension now about this dog. It's becoming evident we're not suited for each other. The breeder will take the dog back, but **refuses to give a refund**. She says it's in the contract (**she never mentioned in the verbal overview of the contract anything about no refund**, but she did say the contract stipulates to bring the dog back instead of to a shelter/etc). It was rainy and windy so we were in a hurry to sign and get out of there. We're not interested in having the money paid set as credit for a puppy. We're not interested in any more dogs from this breeder. With the details above, we think it's likely that she is not recording her income from this purchase in her taxes, and has no sales tax number. 

**Do we have a case to pressure her for a refund and return of the dog?** It's not like we've had him for months - it's been a few days. If not, I will keep him intact and try to sell him to a breeder to recoup some of the losses and give him dog companionship. I knew I shouldn't have purchased this dog from her - there were a few red flags - but I was blinded by his cute face and the time frame I had to work from home over the holidays and get to know him.

54,"[RIP] Booboo, standard dachshund, age 10. IVDD.",dogs,t3_aa8woe,2,False,False,aa8woe,"To my dog on his last night on Earth    


I’m sitting in bed, tears rolling down my eyes as it’s been every night since our fateful follow-up with the vet 2 weeks ago. ‘We’ve tried every option; were at the end of the road. The most humane thing to do for him is euthanasia’.    

I knew it before going in. We’ve been on borrowed time ever since you collapsed 2 years ago. They put you on meds, a few weeks of crate rest. We bought you an orthopedic gel bed. The first year you made a ‘almost miraculous recovery’ the disbelieving vet said. We were so thankful. A few months ago you started going downhill. Not moving as much, not the happy confident dog you once were. Back to the vet. They tried medicine for nerve pain which seemed to help somewhat, along with the cocktail of anti-inflammatoires and pain meds. You took your medicine dutifully as long as it was hidden in a tiny piece of salami (food is life for you). Things seemed ok, we thought it was just part of getting old. We celebrated your tenth birthday. Your muzzle was getting gray. 

A few weeks go we realized the meds weren’t really helping anymore. The anti-inflammatoires gave you bloody diarrhea so we had to stop them. You would be up and down all night trying to find a position comfortable enough to sleep. More pain medicine. You had a hard time getting in and out of bed. In the evenings you would sit next to me and cry from the pain. You stopped playing with your toys. You stopped asking to go potty and peed in the house - this would have been unimaginable before, you were so great at being potty-trained. The gabapentin combined with less movement made you gain weight. We put you on a pretty strict diet and you were just. so. miserable.  Your eyes were sad and dull.    

After considering all the details for the euthanasia options we decided to have it done at the vet’s instead of at home, and donate the difference to our local shelter in your memory. The company I work for matched our donation. The shelter was so thankful.  We then decided to donate every year on your anniversary.    

It took me 5 days to call the pet hospital back and schedule the procedure. I cried after I hung up, and every day since. You were my best and most loyal friend since the day I brought you home. I felt so damned guilty and helpless.    

For your last week we brought home all the dog treats you love most. All the progress you made on your diet went to hell as you happily munched away. We brought you to the park so you could sniff around your old stomping grounds as much as you wanted. You did pretty good with the walking, I have to say. It’s like you knew these were your last walks and you were determined to enjoy them.    

Last night you cuddled with me, licking my arm and hand, laying your head on me and looking up pretty intently with your one brown eye and one blue eye. You hadn’t done that in ages. I figured out at that moment that you were saying goodbye and thank you. I kissed your head all over and breathed in your doggy smell, told you I loved you and you were the best boy.    

Tonight we made clay paw prints as keepsakes. You didn’t really enjoy it. I put away your fancy bed, since you’re sleeping in the teenage boy’s bed tonight. It’ll be a while before I’ll be able to look at it. The teenager decided that your last meal tomorrow would be chicken McNuggets since you’ve never tasted them and he thinks you’d enjoy a few.    

Tomorrow morning I’ll bring you out walking one last time to enjoy the sun and fresh air. Then we’ll have your last meal all together for lunch, and the appointment is at 2pm. Your whole family will be there with you as you depart. I already asked my dad to watch over you in heaven.    

This time tomorrow night, you won’t be here anymore. I’m dreading the emptiness and worried sick about how the teenager who grew up with you will be taking it. My sole comfort is knowing that you will finally be pain-free; I’d much rather suffer in my grief than watch you suffer from all the physical pain.

56,[Help] Need advice- potty training a yorkie.,dogs,t3_aacorn,3,False,False,aacorn,"We have a male yorkie who is just over a year old and are having a few more accidents than we should. The dog is create trained and has no issues holding it for hours in the crate. But when out of the crate, we will let him out every 1-2 hours, and he will come back inside after peeing/pooping outside and pee/poop inside. 

We have done positive reinforcement, treats, wait outside until he uses the restroom, take up food between eating, and keep on a schedule of 1-2 hour let outs.

An issue seems to be, we can’t always get him to let us know when he needs to go out. When we are in the bedroom, where his crate is, he will whine to have us let him out(when he is outside of the crate), but when we are in the living room/basement he will not whine. So if he is out in these spaces, we are always watching but he still manages to sneak away and use the restroom- between the let outs or right after he gets back in. We have cleaned the carpets to try and get rid of any scent, use proper cleaning products for all accidents, but can’t seem to get him to stop. 

We can go days with no accident, but are not able to keep it consistent. I’m not sure what else to do, to get him to tell us in the other living spaces and to keep him from going inside. I am not sure if it’s just his little bladder- he is only 10 pounds- but he holds it in his crate, or if it’s because he is doing it out of anger/spite. 

Just looking for some tips to try! Any help is greatly appreciated!! "

58,[Help] Advice on what I can do to entertain my two under-stimulated dogs.,dogs,t3_aaeqgk,5,False,False,aaeqgk,"Currently me and my two sweet boys aren't in the most ideal of living situations. Luckily this is only temporary, but I'd still like advice for the meantime. I have two dogs one is an Alaskan Husky (aka sled dog) who is, as you can imagine, very high energy. My other pup is an American Staffordshire terrier, who loves being outside, and chewing just about anything. 

Right now we're living in an apartment thanks to the house rental prices here in Washington. I take them on walks during the day, but they are short walks because I am currently five months pregnant, and they're big dogs with totally different opinions on which directions they should go. 

This is the first time in their lives I haven't been able to provide them with a yard. I can tell they're bored as they are sleeping all day. I have a toy box for them with chew toys, but they are bored of those as well. I can't bring them to a dog park because my Staffordshire is so high energy around other dogs (not aggressive just hyper) that I've had issues with other dogs reacting badly. He's much better meeting new dogs one on one. 

If I had the funds to hire someone to take them on walks for me I absolutely would, but paying someone daily to take them on a long walk is out of our budget for at least two more months. My fiance works until late in the day and I work from home so their quality of life is my duty right now. 

So to my point! Sorry for the long intro. I am planning on using my Christmas money to buy them some stimulating toys but they are two very different dogs with different likes. My Staffordshire loves to chew and tear apart squeaky toys, my Alaskan Husky hates squeaky toys and only likes chew toys for playing the keep away game. What are some recommendations you guys have for stimulating toys and activities we can do in the house?"
59,[help] My dog has randomly changed his behaviour,dogs,t3_aabamc,13,False,False,aabamc,"So I have had my dog for around 2 and a half years and he has always been a really good dog. He was an abandoned puppy when we got him. He is an American Staffordshire mixed with something else. We live in Belgium.

He has always been kind to humans and other dogs, everyone in our neighborhood always comments on how nice of a dog he is and how kind he is. He has never barked at another dog while on the lease or been aggressive towards them during the 2 years and a half we had him.

Apparently 3 days ago my dad was letting him out in our garden (no fence) and he saw this one specific dog and just went nuts after him and started attacking him. My dad was luckily able to stop our dog before one of them got hurt and we got of with a scare.

Luckily the owner of the other dog understood our situation and we were lucky that nothing grave happened.

Today while playing ball with my dog he saw the other dog again and even after me pinning him down he went after the other dog, he ignored me shouting ect.

I was able to get him off the other dog before he did anything to the poor dog. He hurt himself while doing this and I'm really scared that my dog has become aggressive towards other dogs and is now an actual threat towards dogs or even potentially humans.

I wanted to ask you guys what I should do now, should I contact a dog specialist to retrain his behaviour towards other dogs, should we put a fence in the garden so he can't run out on the street again?

I really don't know what to do with my dog as I have a feeling that I can't trust him anymore when there are other people or dogs in the area.

61,"[Help] My dog has Giardia, are these symptoms normal? Please help!",dogs,t3_aae9fp,2,False,False,aae9fp,"Hello. My 12 year-old Lhasa Apso has been diagnosed with Giardia. He's my family dog, so he lives with my mom and I'm not living with them anymore. My mom took him to the vet because he was throwing up and not eating his food. The vet thought it was a problem with his teeth and advised her to soften his food by putting it in broth. They did a blood test on him to check his vitals and said everything looked good. However he continued to throw up and I was getting worried, so I took him to the vet. They did x rays and a fecal exam. The x rays showed he was slightly constipated, but were generally normal. The next day they called my mom up and told her he has something called Giardia. They told us to give him this powdered medicine (I can't remember what it's called) once a day for three days and give him 10 mg of omeprazole twice a day. They also advised us to keep him on a bland diet of rice and boiled skinless, boneless chicken. We followed everything and he stopped throwing up, however he also stopped pooping. Since he hadn't thrown up in four days and we were done with the powdered medicine we tried giving him normal food again. He ended up pooping which is good, but my sister told me he has thrown up yellowish-whitish foam three times since last night. It's really hard because I'm across the country right now so I can't take care of him. I made another (third one) vet appointment for him today. On the phone, the vet said we might consider doing an ultrasound. It would cost $450 which is really a lot for me. Even though he's my family dog, nobody else in the family really cares enough to pay that sort of money for him so it all comes down to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever had a dog have Giardia? Did they experience similar symptoms? How long did they last? Did you end up having to do an ultrasound? Any help on this issue would be much appreciated as I'm extremely stressed out right now. Thank you."

I'm fully capable of looking after such a dog, have enough space for it and grew up around protective herding dogs, the kind that don't like strangers or allow them to come near.

So don't worry about any of that, I wouldn't be asking on here were I not prepared or capable.

That being said I now live in a suburban area, a couple years ago a house I used to live in was broken into while I was home, it was a scary experience, luckily the guy was alone and not carrying any weapons, he ran off as soon as he knew I was home.

That being said the experience has left me with the want for guard dogs.

Ideally I would like the dogs to ward off the criminal rather than any altercation actually happen between them however I need a breed that when push comes to shove they won't back down.

I have a pregnant wife atm and have thier safety and mine in mind.

Also, before anybody says it, I'm not an idiot, I know dogs aren't unstoppable and I don't expect them to be able to stop any and all threats that they may encounter, however 3 well trained gaurd dogs would definitley make me feel a whole lot safer to said potential threats.

And do you agree with this form of treatment for a suspected grass seed in foot?",dogs,t3_aaaev0,3,False,False,aaaev0,"We’ve been to the vets A LOT lately and we’ve moved so we are trying to find the right vet for us.

My 8yo male Jack Russell got a suspected grass seed in his foot last Weds (19th Dec) we took him to the vet they knocked him out cut into his foot and found nothing and put him on a course of antibiotics (Amoxyclav 5mg). 

We finished the course and still no seed but his foot wasn’t getting better. We had to put down our cat on Xmas Eve night due to a suspected snake bite which was missed the first time and he was sent home after a day, we took him to the vet after hours and had to do the same Xmas eve to be told it may or may not be a snake bite, he needs a transfusion which is 50/50 chance of killing him and if not it could be eating a rat that had been poisoned or cancer so we put our poor old mate to sleep and had a rough Christmas.


So due to that fact we thought we’d take Baxter to another vet for a second opinion as we found he hasn’t been right since going under general anaesthetic the first time and didn’t want to put him through that again.


The vet saw him and seemed really thorough and we were happy with him.
He prescribed another form of antibiotics (Cephalexin 200mg) and some anti-inflammatories (Previcox 57mg) and Silica 6x which he claimed if we were patient would bring the seed to the surface in anywhere from 7-10 days to 6 months.


Now I’m fairly sceptical guy and he didn’t specifically say it was homeopathic but I suspected it was and confirmed it when I researched it when I got home.


So my question is, is my new vet a kook who believes in Homeopathy or did he give us, the owners a placebo so it didn’t feel like he was doing nothing by telling us to sit and the body will expel it?


I don’t believe in homeopathy and believe science has thoroughly disproved its effectiveness.

I’ve given him the Cephalexin and Previcox as prescribed but not given him the Silica 6x which from I can tell is just a sugar pill.

72,[Help] dogsitting a elderly dog with dementia without knowing it.,dogs,t3_aaadpy,7,False,False,aaadpy,"hi! i’m petsitting a 16 yo boy, a very good cocker. 

He is with me for 4 days. The first 2 days went good, he struggled just during the night, sleeping 5 hours and then starting pacing around the house. 
During the day everything was fine and we went to long walks. 

Today (the 3rd day) he definitely got worse.
He sleep like 3 hours and then started pacing around the house hitting his head on every wall and forniture (with the lights on). He eat just a little bit of boiled chicken. 

He totally has all the symptoms of dog dementia: paces in circles, remains blocked under fortnitures, staring at walls, looks disoriented, can’t chew properly and can’t put his head in the water bowl, loosing his balance ecc.. (he looks drunk)

His parents literally didn’t tell me anything about this situation.  I sent them video of today’s behavior and they told me that sometimes it happens.  That he has highs and lows. 

I’m worried because i don’t know how to help him, he’s hitting his head a lot (today he looks blind) on my walls because obviously this is a new environment for him. 

I was told that he spend the day on his dog bed, and when i met him the first time he was in fact very calm. 

I’m a little bit anxious because caring for a doggie like this is something for experts and he shouldn’t leave his comfort zone in this situation. 
I told them that mine is a passion and that i know how to deal with dogs because i had doggies, but i am not not an expert. 

I knew his age, but i already cared for elderly dogs, so i was confident about this. 
However i honestly never seen dog dementia. He’s being psychologically distruttive for himself and my family and i do not have the skills for this. 

I’m fortunately keeping him hydrated, but i’m worried because he ate very few and he won’t stop having compulsive pacing behavior (he could even hurt himself). 

I’m super stressed, i can’t have second for me, even for the toilet and no sleep because he restless paces all night and day. 

I was not looking for something like this.  I wanted to look for a normal pet, have fun and care for him, i didn’t want a medical-behavioral job.  
I also needed 3/4 hours per day to work with my pc, and i obviously can’t. 

Any advice? how can i make him better?

Thanks!"

75,[Help] Having a tough time finding a new brand of dry food for my dog with DCM. Here are my thoughts and some brands I am considering. Please steer me in the right direction!,dogs,t3_aa5zvr,10,False,False,aa5zvr,"A few weeks ago I learned that my dog has an enlarged heart. Since then I have been trying to learn all I can about the potential connection between diet and DCM. I have been reading all the related peer-reviewed articles and studies, and compiled a list of ingredients to avoid and ingredients to watch out for. 


It's been very challenging finding a brand or formula that does not contain those ingredients. In addition there are so many factors outside of ingredients to take into account! Like how the companies process the ingredients (i.e. thermal processing could lead to reduced taurine available for absorption) which isn't readily available information. Even ingredient interaction could still play a role in DCM and ingredients that may be toxic but not yet identified.


**I will try to summarize the options I am considering but I would really appreciate some help!** Note that my dog is a shih-tzu in her senior years. She has been eating Orijen Senior kibbles for the last 6 years or more.

***

# 1) Purina Pro Plan
Highly recommended in this sub due to the company's lengthy history, feeding trials and large number of veterinarians on staff. 

However, I found this [article](https://truthaboutpetfood.com/pet-foods-customer-service/) regarding a customer finding flakes of aluminum in a Pro Plan chicken formula. Is this something I should be concerned about?

Here are the 3 formulas that seem to suit my dog the best:

**Pro Plan Sensitive Skin and Stomach Salmon and Rice Formula**

* This diet is listed on Tuft's list of low sodium dog foods which is great for dogs with heart disease!

* In an article from AVMA it seems like this formula contains ingredients that they define as part of a ""BEG diet: (Boutique, Exotic-ingredient, and Grain-free): salmon and barley. 

* Salmon isn't really talked about in the articles/studies I've read (unlike lamb formulas that have been linked to taurine deficiency). They just categorize it as ""exotic."" Salmon may not be an issue I think?

* Barley, on the other hand, has lead to lower concentrations of taurine in dogs according to a 2003 NCBI study. 

**Pro Plan Small Breed Formula**

* Contains barley (see above)

**Pro Plan Shredded Chicken and Rice Formula**

* Soybeans is listed in the FDA investigation as an example of legumes. This formula contains soybean meal. 

##Pro Plan TL;DR: I love the fact the company conducts feeding trials and has a big staff of vets, but worried about ingredient quality/sourcing (i.e. article about metal flakes in kibbles). ""Small Breed"" and ""Salmon &amp; Rice"" formulas seem great except for barley. Though I am not too concerned because barley is more of an ingredient to watch out for instead of outright avoiding like legumes, peas, potatoes, etc.

***

# 2) BALANCE IT

This option requires a little more effort but I like the idea of using healthy ingredients that I already have (chicken thighs, broccoli, oatmeal, etc.). It involves weighing out proportions, cooking, and adding a supplement to ensure my dog gets all her nutrients.

My main concern was how legit this company is and the quality/safety of their supplement. It appears as though the founder is a certified nutritionist from UC Davis. I also see this company mentioned by the WSAVA which is reassuring. 

Any thoughts about them? I don't see many mentions on /r/dogs but maybe it's due to how time-consuming it is to prep home-cooked dog food?

##TD;LR I completely control the ingredients but it can be a bit time-consuming. Main issues: prep time and supplement quality.

***

# 3) SMALLER DOG FOOD COMPANIES

This could potentially be referred to as the ""boutique companies"" which have been connected to DCM. It also means they don't have the history behind their products, and likely don't conduct feeding trials or have vets on staff. Another downside (though minor in comparison) is most of these products require shipping to Canada.

The main positive is that I have found some formulas that contain none of the problematic ingredients. For example ""Frenchie's Kitchen"" chicken formula. Other companies whose formulas I like include ""Primal"" and ""Dogs For The Earth."" I believe these three companies are public about the source of all their ingredients which is reassuring. Feel free to recommend me others.

However, I really don't want to fall for marketing again (which lured me to Orijen's grain-free in the first place). 

##TL;DR Quality ingredients, no ingredients connected to DCM, but companies likely do not conduct feeding trials or have vets on staff."

77,[HELP] How to pad train my rescue? Plus a few other questions!,dogs,t3_aa9n4x,5,False,False,aa9n4x,"I adopted a dog from the humane society last week. She is so loving and cuddly and I love her so much already. 

I want to pad train her for when I am at work. Currently she is crated but I think other than the potty issue she is a good enough girl to be out. 
Here is where I run into an issue; with a puppy I would just keep her on the pad until she pees and praise her since they pee so frequently. However Midge is two years old. She goes hours between going potty. I can’t keep her on the pad for more than a few minutes because she lays down and I’m afraid she’ll learn it’s just another place to nap rather than potty. She also does not know what “potty” means, so I can’t just tell her to go potty. Any suggestions??

My next question is how do I teach her to play? She has no interest in fetch or tugging and I would really like a way to get out her energy on rainy days. 

Also, Midge is really gassy and it smells BAD. and she poops a lot. Not as in frequency but volume. Could this be a food brand issue or a take her to the vet issue?

Sorry for all the questions, I’ve always had dogs but I’ve always adopted a puppy so adopting an older dog kinda threw me for a loop!
Thanks in advance!

I know, I know, for the 99% of you, this is common sense. But it seems that common sense isn't so common now a days.

My fellow dog loving redditors, I'm sure you've all been in that situation where someone gives your dog a treat without asking you first.

If you're that person feeding other dogs... Stop. Stop right now. You wouldn't feed someone's child right?

Speaking from experience, my dog has a serious pancreas issue and can only eat special treats prescribed by the vet. And while I appreciate your good intentions, you're not the one who's stuck paying the vet bill when you inadvertently ""poison"" my best friend.

We kept an eye on it and decided to take him to the vet today to make sure it wasn't anything serious.

This was the first time we've taken him to the vet, so we were slightly worried how he would react. He has been before but since we're his third owners, we hadn't had the pleasure yet.

He was SUCH a good boy at the vet! The vet praised him for being so inquisitive and curious and loving of new people. Usually the breed can be quite shy and reserved with new people.

He squirmed a little when the vet had to put fluorescent dye in his eyes to check his corneas but nothing too serious.

It was about time he got his yearly vaccines and check up so we decided to do this and save on having to get a new time next month.

He didn't even flinch when he got his shot and besides a bit of tartar (I think thats what it's called, we call it toothstones) a little too much weight and a small eye infection, he seems perfectly healthy.

He has been awarded with lots of pets and snuggles when we got home.

85,[Fluff] [Monthly Brag] My dog healed.,dogs,t3_aa4nn7,6,False,False,aa4nn7,"This year- my little trio was on a road trip to go apartment hunting half-way across the country. 

On our very last stretch of the trip while visiting family and staying the night- I woke up to a dog I did not recognize. In a city I has spent zero time in. Over night- a crazy infection attacked her face- that in a matter of hours spread all the way from her nose to completely around her muzzle. And after a day without a cone- to her eye. 

I ran around like a crazy woman- spending the last of my funds on emergency visits and veterinary offices- only to find out absolutely nothing. Skin conditions can be tricky like that. I learned a very important thing I can hopefully transfer to y’all- no matter how scary it is- do not waste your time on an emergency vet for SKIN CONDITIONS. Go straight to booking a biopsy somewhere. You’ll save precious time and money! And! STORE YOUR CONES SOMEWHERE. Don’t throw em out- cause sadly enough- you never know when you’ll need them. 

Luckily enough we were able to rent a room from friends long enough to get this figured out. Luckily enough- we ended up at the very first vet school that took low-income patients... Turns out my dog ran into a fungus she was not accustomed to along the way- and had a really bad reaction. 

For two months- she was coned. She was quarantined. For two months- she lost her ability to play and sniff and eat normal food. She was depressed and she was angry at the world for not being able to do the bare necessities. 

People told me to give up. We persevered- and she most definitely did not give up. They say that these skin conditions can leave a permanent scar, take up to a year to heal. That she might not have grown her hair back. Well y’all- this picture is from [today](https://imgur.com/m11Bqml).She’s back to chasing squirrels up trees. She’s growing all that hair back. She’s happy! 

And I am sitting here in my new place today thinking about all the people I’ve met that have said “well how’d you end up here?”
And I have the simplest answer of all, “my dog.”

86,[Help] Does my 12.5 yr old golden retriever have dementia?,dogs,t3_aa44nh,4,False,False,aa44nh,"Sorry for the essay - My boy Bobby is in superb physical health despite his age but he has been behaving oddly for the past 5-6 months. He has always been very well behaved, has never tried to escape, doesn’t come up the stairs (he’s not allowed) - but in the last 5-6 months he:
(1) constantly tries to escape so now we have to tie him to a long rope when he wants to go outside and this only happens in the late afternoon and evenings. He always barks (sort of whiney barks) when he is outside for no apparent reason other than only being able to go 5 meters from the door, and he refuses to come back inside even though he might’ve been out there for several hours in the freezing cold, even really tasty treats and food can’t lure him back. When he does manage to escape, we often find him looking confused in the neighbours driveway.
(2) he sneaks upstairs and scratches the carpet in the corners of bedrooms, mostly at door corners such as a wardrobe door or en-suite door - and again, he refuses to move even when offered treats. He always looks sad and worried when I find him and comforting him doesn’t make him any better
(3) he seems to get worried and scared when there are more than 3-4 people around, when usually he has always been very sociable.

He’s a golden and absolutely loves food, so it’s so strange that now even the tastiest and smelliest of treats cannot make him move and he refuses them. He still happily eats his breakfast and dinner every day without any issue. We have noticed he does better in the mornings - he is his sociable self, seems happy, looks forward to his daily walk, doesn’t try to escape. He also sleeps all throughout the night with no issues.
He doesn’t have any issues with urinating inside which is usually the case when dogs have dementia, right? 
Our main concern is when he tries to escape and he’s obviously not happy being tied up, I know he enjoys doing his rounds of the garden which is fairly large. We have thoroughly checked for escape routes but he always finds a way. 
He probably does have dementia... if you guys agree, is there anything we can do to make him happier?

Thanks for your help. Sorry for the long post.

When he was very young, he had a couple traumatic experiences with dogs (he was never injured, the dogs were just large and very excited and he was very small at the time). Ever since these events, he’s been terrified of all animals.

We’re at my grandma’s for Christmas and she has the sweetest little 15 year old Havanese who wouldn’t hurt a fly. She is the first dog that my brother has felt comfortable being in the same room with, and he has verbally expressed the desire to pet her. However, he has come to a stand still. He’s been here for two weeks, and by the first two days he was fine being in the same room. A week and a half later, and he has yet to make further progress even though he said he wants to. We all are trying to encourage him, but he says that “anytime you tell me that it’s okay or that it’s safe, it just puts more of my attention on the dog and that makes me nervous”. 

This dog won’t even lick anybody let alone bite — zero danger. Although, I do empathize with my brother because I used to be afraid of dogs as well. But, I then met one dog who changed that for me and I fell in love. I’m of the belief that it just takes that one special dog that you connect with that can dispel many of your fears surrounding dogs. He has told me that he feels this is the dog that will do that for him, but we are having trouble getting him to push further in that pursuit and he gets very upset every time we try to make an effort. Any tips?

89,[help] Dogs similar in behaviour to Siberian Huskies,dogs,t3_aa6ygc,11,False,False,aa6ygc,"I recently lost both my dogs, one to cancer and the other to old age.

Unfortunately the weather here is too hot and even though we can make it work, we don't want to take in a husky and trouble him because of the heat. And I don't stay home too long due to college so my parents who generally take really good care of dogs, but won't let the husky into their bedrooms due to the extensive hair shedding.

91,[Help] Adopting a 4yo lab/husky mix into a house with a cat- looking for advice,dogs,t3_aa6fp9,7,False,False,aa6fp9,"Hello!

Like the title says, my fiancé and I are adopting a 4-year-old dog that is supposedly a lab/husky mix (she doesn’t seem to have much husky in her from her looks, I intend to do DNA testing). She’s being given up because her family recently had a baby with severe respiratory issues and the baby cannot be in a house with animals.

I grew up with a collie, golden retriever, and newfie mix. I was pretty involved in training them, and have helped friends with their dogs. Fiancé and I are animals lovers who have been waiting to own our own house to adopt a dog of our own- the timing seems perfect to give this girl a new,
forever home. We currently have a 8ish year old cat, who has been around dogs when friends with dogs have stayed over, and through one roommate who had a dog. She’s mostly aloof with any other animal, but tolerates their presence eventually.

The dog is fixed, up to date on all her shots, and seems well-socialized and pretty well trained. She’s never been kept in a crate. She has been around children, small dogs, and some guinea pigs, all without issue. Her current owner says she has chased squirrels and stray cats, but has never chased any indoor animals. However, she hasn’t ever been around an indoor cat and due to the distance between us and her, we can’t do an introduction prior to adopting her. 

So far, I’ve installed a very tall pet gate (with a small cat door) in an area where the dog can be confined while we are at work. I intend to introduce the animals slowly and to keep them separated unless we are around to monitor. Eventually, if they seem to be okay, I plan to leave the cat door on the gate open so that the cat can roam freely, but have an escape route if need be. 

I’ve read a lot about introducing cats and dogs, but most of that advice includes crate training which I’m hesitant to do to a dog that’s never been in a crate, especially while she’s going through so many other changes. None of my dogs growing up were ever in crates, and that may also play into my hesitation. 

Does anyone have additional advice for introducing the two animals/ensuring safety for our very loved cat? Will it be less effective without a crate? Will her (possibly) being part husky make this more dangerous?

I want to do what’s best for both animals and all advice is very wanted. "

While I went to give my buddy a ride I came back to my dog acting really strange. She was wobbly while standing, almost tip over, would flinch her paws up every time she'd step as if it hurt, stare off into space and flinched anytime I'd reach my hand towards her. 

Since I was gone I don't know if there was an episode during that time or if this is as bad as its going to get. I took her to the vet regardless, he's seen it a million times so he's not as worried as I am just to try pill 1 pill every 12hrs gave me 6 of them and then to go from there. 

But now she's just laying on the couch motionless I can't take it she's usually so high-strung and playful, she's a German wirehair. Usually some time after a seizure a dog regains it's personality, right? It's been well over an hour now and since I work nights shes usually up later than this. 

Should I be worried of something happening again? Did the whole process exhaust her or is she depressed about it? She finally fell asleep after 20mins of starting into space but I wonder if I should stay by her at all times for the rest of the night."

94,[Help] Aggressive Boxer!,dogs,t3_aa7p8s,4,False,False,aa7p8s,"Soooo, I have a four year old male Boxer that I adopted when he was 8 weeks old. I’ve raised him from a baby &amp; he is my baby! 

Basically his entire life he’s been pampered &amp; spoiled &amp; has remained true to the breed - adorably dumb &amp; forever in puppy mode. Boxers are my breed! They’re the best &amp; I’ve had them my entire life.

He is a playful &amp; snuggly dog around all kids, loves everyone (terrible guard dog) &amp; is super intimidated by our cats. Basically a big ol’ puppy. 

Then he sees another dog &amp; Cujo appears. 

His aggression towards other dogs is extremely violent, it almost seems like he *wants* to *fight*. There is no separating him when he gets into that mode, he basically loses his mind &amp; turns into a legitimate beast. It’s honestly terrifying. 

This behavior didn’t start until this year. He’s four years old &amp; we’ve had other dogs in &amp; out of our home all of his life (we’ve housed many dogs for friends throughout the years). But now a really horrifying trait has emerged &amp; he’s become difficult to handle.

We recently got new neighbors &amp; we’ve had to carefully coordinate with them regarding dog outdoor schedules because they have a Boston Terrier that our dog keeps trying to attack through the fence.

We can no longer walk him because every time he encounters another dog he loses his fucking mind &amp; immediately starts foaming at the mouth &amp; wants to attack from a mile away &amp; he’s 90 lbs of pure muscle so he’s difficult to handle on a leash/harness when he enters that frame of mind.

Just last month, there was a stray dog who wandered up to our fence line &amp; my Boxer just happened to be in our backyard &amp; a terrible fight ensued &amp; our dog pretty much attempted to rip off the face of the stray dog through our chain link fence. It was a blood bath. I called animal control. 

Every time someone is walking their dog, I have to make sure he’s inside &amp; if he’s already inside, I have to make sure our big door is shut so he’s not even able to look out of the storm door because he’ll charge the glass just to *try* to get to them.

I am at a loss. 

Over the summer I reached out to a trainer that was recommended to me by multiple people because he works with aggressive dogs &amp; yet he more or less kind of told me that he wasn’t going to help with my dog because some dogs just have that bred into them &amp; on one hand I believe that but on another I call bullshit. 

I love him, I’ve raised him. I don’t know what I did or didn’t do that has made this behavior come out but he’s pretty much become a major stress in our lives because he’s a ticking time bomb &amp; a liability &amp; he’s going to kill someone’s dog &amp; that’s going to be devastating for EVERYONE because then he’ll be the next to go.

102,[Help] Advice on possibly rehoming a dog with behavioral issues (separation anxiety),dogs,t3_aa5o0t,5,False,False,aa5o0t,"It kills me to be making this post, but I really want some advice. I have a dog (Chihuahua mix) who has extreme separation anxiety. When I first adopted him 5 years ago, I didn’t work so all my time was for him and we were the best of friends. He was a sweet, chill, well behaved dog. Nowadays I have to work full time, and his behavioral problems due to anxiety just keep getting worse and worse. I have tried everything, from behavioral training, getting him a crate, supplements, spending more time with him, extra exercise, but none of it is even remotely helping. He gets into everything when I’m not paying attention to him and it makes him sick.

I think I’ve come to the realization that he’s not as happy as he could be with me. I think he needs someone who is around more, and unfortunately being in my mid 20s, that can’t be me. As heartbreaking as it is, I made a commitment to ensure that this sweet dog has the best life he possibly can, and I think the next right thing to do may be to see if there’s someone who might be a better match for him.

Has anyone had any experience with rehoming dogs with difficult behavior issues? He’s not aggressive. I’m not trying to pin this issue onto someone else unexpectedly, so I want to be upfront. I know that he needs a specific kind of person with a lot of time for him. I guess I just don’t even know where to start. I’ve never rehomed a pet before and the fact that I’m leaning toward this has made me cry so many times. Ultimately I want him to be happy, and I will not stop caring for him unless I absolutely know that I found someone who could make him happier than me.

105,[Help] Suggestions for rescue organizations?,dogs,t3_aa6zwh,1,False,False,aa6zwh,"I have always loved dogs and I think I am almost ready to be able to commit to rescuing one of my own. I am currently just trying to find good organizations to adopt a dog through! Of course I am going to look into local shelters and I am looking into rescue websites, but I am having a hard time finding one within my state! 

I’ve been interested in looking into adult/elderly dogs and dogs rescued from abuse and animal testing because they aren’t as “desirable” as puppies or purebreeds. I just really want to give a dog that would otherwise be stuck in a shelter or euthanized, a happy home to live in!

I am currently living in Colorado, USA and although I have no intention of moving out of state for a while, I fully intend on bringing this dog with me and accommodating him/her. I have no opposition towards any breed, size, etc.

If anyone can give me recommendations or can help me get started, I would greatly appreciate it!  

Thank you!:)

106,[Help] My dog keeps peeing in the house,dogs,t3_aa6zv8,8,False,False,aa6zv8,"Hello all,

  
I have two lovely dogs, but the youngest (a 1-year-old unneutered male) keeps peeing in the house. I use the bathroom as a kennel for my pups when I'm at work so they don't pee in the house. Whenever I am home and let them roam, he always has accidents despite that the bathroom has tons of pads.

1. Do any of you have tips to get him trained to use the pads I have in the bathroom?
2. Please leave suggestions for diapers that fit securely. Most diapers (both reusable and disposable) do not fit him as they slip off his tail easily or his private parts don't fit. Know of perhaps a diaper that fits around his chest?"

108,[breeds] Help me choose a dog please!,dogs,t3_aa1wke,5,False,False,aa1wke,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* This will be the first dog I own by myself. I grew up with dogs, though.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* I prefer to rescue a dog

 3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* I live in an apartment, so I need something that is fine with not having too much space. However, I go hiking a lot and I live in an area that has good parks, so I want something that will be able to keep up on a hike (or is at least easy to carry if it gets tired and I have to carry it).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* I would like something smaller since I live in an apartment. I've only ever had border collies, so I would be comfortable with something similar to that, but a border collie's energy level and need for stimulation will not fit my lifestyle at this time. I've also spent time around golden retrievers, but I worry that those would be too big for my current lifestyle.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* The most important thing is being good with people and other dogs and being a good walker. I would also like to teach the dog to do tricks, but that's not very important.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* Several hours a day. I am gone for work about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so I worry the dog would not get enough interaction, but besides that I will be able to interact with the dog almost all the time.  

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* I plan on walking the dog for at least an hour every day. I don't think there is a dog park in my area, but there are a lot of dogs around, so it will get plenty of interaction with other dogs and people.  

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I am open to brushing and basic grooming at home. If the dog needs an actual haircut beyond basic trimming, I will take it to a groomer, but I would prefer to keep this to a few times a year rather than a monthly trip to the groomer. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Something smaller that can live in an apartment. I believe most apartments in my area have a 50 lbs limit for dogs, so something smaller than that. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* I prefer a minimum on all three. A quieter dog would be ideal since I live in an apartment.  

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* I would like a dog that can learn to handle itself off-leash so I don't have to worry about what it may do, but I do not intend to let my dog off-leash in an unfenced area.  

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* I would like a snuggly dog.  

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* I would like an eager-to-please dog.  

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I would like a dog that will alert me to someone entering our home, but doesn't go crazy with barking and jumping.  

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No. Because of the area I live in and living in an apartment, a dog-aggressive dog is not an option. There are other dogs in my building, so the dog will at some point encounter another dog in the elevator. It must be able to behave with other dogs and people in an elevator.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* Chewing on things  

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* About 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* I am the only person in the household, so the dog will be my responsibility.  

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* I may at some point get a cat.  

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* No, but there are children in my neighborhood, so I would like to teach the dog how to interact with children.  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I currently rent. I believe the weight restriction is 50 lbs and under.  

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* I live in Wisconsin. I am not sure about laws banning specific breeds in my area, but I am not interested in controversial breeds, such as pitbulls, because I rent and they would limit my housing options.  

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* The temperature in Wisconsin fluctuates a lot. A summer day is usually around 80F, but can get into the 90s. A winter day is around 20F, but can get well below zero.  

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* I travel a lot throughout the state, so the dog will also be traveling a lot. I need something that will be good with car rides. A typical long car ride will be 1-4 hours a few times a month. There will be plenty of opportunities to stop and let the dog out, so it won't be 4 hours straight in the car.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  \* Is there a dog that is even right for my lifestyle? I worry about leaving it home for 8 hours while I'm at work. "
109,"[HELP] We brought in a stray, and want my current dog to be comfortable",dogs,t3_aa6x7z,2,False,False,aa6x7z,"On Christmas Eve we brought in the sweetest and most gentle black lab stray- we figured she had to have been somebody’s pet at some point because she is spayed, but her current health conditions are so severe it was obvious she had been separated for awhile or was poorly taken care of. 

Not to go into too much detail, but long story short when we took her into the vet they found a microchip. Apparently her previous owner has died and has nowhere to go but the pound. She is estimated to be 8 y/o with severe hematoma in both ears (so solid the vet couldn’t drain them), ear infections, and is extremely underweight. We figured that her chances of being adopted as a middle aged dog with health conditions that require attention were not fantastic, so we decided to keep her. 

What I’m worried about is our current dog. Our current dog is a 5 y/o female lab mix. They did not meet face to face until today, after Stray got the OK from the vet. Current dog is friendly but cautious around new dogs, but does have a couple of doggy friends who we have noticed she gets along great with. I have been hearing horror stories about keeping two females together in the same house. I was wondering if anybody had tips to make the transition easier? During their first meeting, new dog was very lick-y which I understand means she is showing some submissive behaviors. They did ok- they aren’t playful but they don’t seem to hate each other. There have been a few snaps, but I’m assuming that’s just some normal doggy communication that doesn’t need much worry. Current dog let her in the house fine after some outdoor introductions, and they are existing in the same space pretty decently. 

I don’t want tensions to build / develop to a point that we have to get rid of new dog, but we have to keep current dog happy as she is our first priority. Is this f/f pairing inherently a disaster? And is a not-perfect first impression mean they will never be friends? Are there tips for a smooth transition for both my new and old dog? "

114,[Help] My dog is not friendly to my husband,dogs,t3_aa2uys,6,False,False,aa2uys,"Hey all.

A bit of background: I've had my dog, a female shepherd/husky cross named Karma, for a little over three years now. She was about three when I got her and I was told she had been badly abused by a man in the past, so she would be a bit careful around men in general going forward. I'm female, so she bonded to me quite easily and we're the best of friends.

My husband recently moved in with me, as of September this year. When I'm around, she still clearly prefers my company, but will tolerate him or sometimes even indulge him in play. When I'm not around, or even if I'm just sleeping, she is very cold to him. She growls and shows her teeth when he approaches, hides upstairs from him, and won't even come down when asked if she wants to go for a walk (#1 favourite thing in the world) or offered food (#2 favourite thing in the world). He has even tried to put her collar and leash on while she's upstairs, so that she understands he really means he wants to take her for a walk, and she will just lay there and stare at him, refusing to budge. The only thing that ever works is pouring her dog food into her dish, which brings her running downstairs at top speed, at which point he can slip on her collar and leash and take her outside for a walk. On her walks with him, she is completely fine.

He has never hit her. He offers her food, treats, cuddles, pets, and play very often, but she never warms up to him unless I'm in the room. How can we get her to like him more? I know the abuse in the past is the key factor here, but it's been over three years since that's happened at least, and my dad also used to live in this house, so surely she understands by now that men are not all bad. She even approaches men she doesn't know who visit our home, or men we encounter on walks, albeit carefully.

Thanks for any suggestions!

115,[Discussion] / [Advice] Human gets between dog fight and comes out bitten - what would you do?,dogs,t3_aa6jzd,3,False,False,aa6jzd,"My first-time dog-walker (call him ""Steve"") took my dog (""Samson"" - 2 y/o large breed) to the enclosed dog park in my apartment complex. The only other people/dogs there was my neighbor (""Blake"") and his dog (""Bubba"" -3y/o large breed). I was not there. Neither animal has any history whatsoever with aggression or biting humans.

\-

Samson and Bubba have played before. They are both good dogs, but do growl when playing occasionally. This time, however, apparently their fighting got more serious than usual, Blake stepped in to separate them, and came out with a bite on his hand which he says came from Samson. He had to go to ER, see a hand specialist, but thankfully has no long-term damage and now no further treatment is needed.

\-

Blake and I have been extremely cordial and communicative throughout the whole process. I was out of state when this occurred, so I've had to listen to the only two accounts present - Steve and Blake. I'd like to keep Steve's account out of the equation here, as it makes things more complicated as he does not sound reliable (as in, when I asked him what happened he made no mention of any injury or bite whatsoever, when it was apparently so clear that Blake was in pain that 2 other neighbors came out of their apartments to see what was going on). That being said, for the sake of argument, let's say Blake's account is factual. Blake says (in his own words) that he should have pulled Bubba by the hind legs, but instead, grabbed him by the chest/torso - which happened to be where Samson's next bite was landing. I want to make clear, that this is his account and that I'm not trying to put a positive spin on this for my sake. We've both apologized, agreed this is an unfortunate circumstance, and Blake has said countless times he knows Samson was not going for his hand, that the force dogs use against each other is far different than what they use with humans, etc.

\-

Neither of us want to involve legal counsel and would like to handle privately. I've let him know that I'm happy to help with medical costs, but did not give specifics or an amount. He was grateful for that, the same way I was for him (at this point at least) saying he did not wish to hire a lawyer or take this to court. He is a genuinely good person and I'd like to think we are both rational, not-reactionary people. Our most recent meeting was important as it finally totaled the bills. After insurance, the conclusive cost was $900.

\-

I asked him what he believed was fair. He asked for me to pay the full amount. I said I'd like to think about it. I wanted to ask this community, from an ethical and/or legal perspective, what would you offer?

\-

PS - just in case some people ask, but not sure this factors into your answers, both of us are tight on money. I am in debt (but with a steady job) and he is a full-time grad student.

PSS - I have already let Blake know (in person) that I wasn't planning on paying the full amount (but I do want to pay some portion of it) - and asked if refusing to pay ""all"" of it was problematic for him. He said no, that it was just a starting offer. Why not ask for it all at first. I told him I'd do the same thing if I were in his position."

She’s very small in comparison to the rest of the breed which rest around 50-60 pounds generally and she should be 40-45 max

120,[HELP] Dog suddenly behaving strange around 10 month old baby... unsure what to think.,dogs,t3_aa1m80,5,False,False,aa1m80,"Our 7 year old terrier mix has always been super sweet with our new addition - kept his distance most of the time but would come by with the occasional lick and tail wag, and would lay in her room as I put her down for a nap. Baby's now nearly 10 months and crawling and walking with a push toy like crazy, and suddenly I have a weird feeling about his behavior towards her. He follows her around when she's walking and gets up in her face to lick her and if I call him to sit on the couch and leave her alone he watches her like a hawk. I can't tell if it's just cute protectiveness or if I should be worried that her new mobility is causing him to, I dunno, feel more dominant? He's also been more clingy with me, following me around the house and sitting next to me all the time. Perhaps the two are related... some sort of newfound jealousy?

I suppose I should be 100% transparent and admit he's had aggression issues before with other dogs and strangers (mostly mailmen). We've been extra super cautious with the two of them because of his history, and as of just a couple days ago he's never displayed any sort of worrisome behaviors towards the baby ( I wonder if I'm being paranoid because of past issues?)

Are there any behaviors in particular I should keep an eye out for? I NEVER allow them to be alone together of course, but everything I search about ""issues with dogs licking baby's face"" seems to be about germs whereas I'm more concerned about him becoming aggressive towards her.

Any insight is appreciated."
121,[Help] Older rescue seems miserably bored but won't play,dogs,t3_aa0x3m,8,False,False,aa0x3m,"Hello all! Haven't posted on reddit in years so hoping this is all within this subs rules...

&amp;#x200B;

I have a +/- 10 year old rescue brussels griffon, who my husband rescued before we met and it was estimated he was around 5 at that time. We have speculated that he was very likely a stud, as his features are purebred, he was not fixed (at \~5yo) when he was found, he has a clearly abusive history/PTSD, and he didn't know how to use stairs, a harness, or act like a ""dog"" (barely still does).

&amp;#x200B;

He's come A LONG LONG way and we're so proud of him, but now that he's happier and healthier, he's much spunkier and seems to be needing something that we cannot figure out  / don't know how to give him.

&amp;#x200B;

An attempt at a long-story-short: he never learned how to play and won't play, but is bored to death all of the time it seems like. He doesn't care about toys (but also doesn't have enough teeth to use them anyway) and is not really smart enough (sorry little guy) to fetch or anything of the like. He's food-motivated but only for meals (kongs w/ peanut butter, etc, have failed and his face is too flat for food mazes, he'd just starve.... ), and leaving him with food-motivated toys only results in him pooping or peeing on them (he's only housebroken when you're home... joys of a rescue). We don't have a yard right now and are not allowed to get another dog in our place... we've been looking to move FOR his sake specifically, but it's been unrealistic so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly, the only way we've ever been able to figure out he likes to ""play"" is for him to stand vaguely out of reach from you and bark. That's it. He doesn't/won't stray from us at off-leash parks and he doesn't care at all about other dogs. He's not smart enough (or simply not interested enough) in doing anything like nose-training (and tbh I'm not sure his senses are good enough for anything like that either). Sadly we can't afford doggie daycare and don't have any friends with dogs to go on dates with, and no friends who can stop by to get some energy out who are available or nearby....

&amp;#x200B;

He's often sighing heavily and constantly fidgeting (not in pain, had that checked out....) and is very dramatic during the night standing up and collapsing down onto the hardwoods when people are trying so sleep, clearly indicating he is antsy. All I can think of is to just walk/run him harder but he's fickle about that (particularly in inclement weather, in seattle), and that's not very ""fun"" either really.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just wondering/hoping anyone might have any behavioral insight or suggestions who know more about this than we do? Poor guy seems miserable and giving scritches/pets/love is just not cutting it. Thank you so much!!

122,[Vent] People need to stop putting their hands on random strangers' dogs in public places without asking. ESPECIALLY when I'm actively training the dog.,dogs,t3_a9vthd,20,False,False,a9vthd,"Some people disagree with me, but I'm of the opinion that dogs don't really like being pet on the head.  I know that about 2/3 of the dogs I've had in my life (over a dozen) would much prefer a chest pat.

Then we amp that up by introducing the people who don't ask permission to pet a stranger's dog and just assume that because the dog looked their way and isn't growling that touching it is okay.  And then they always go for the head.

Then we amp that up because a lot of these people have children.  Some of these children get to the dogs before the parents do and immediately man-handle them whilst squealing and screaming.  This could be *extremely* dangerous and result in a dog being put down for being ""dangerous"" or ""aggressive"" when he was actually unexpectedly tackled from behind by two rambunctious children.

Then...  We amp *that* up by throwing my training into the mix.  I cannot tell you how many times a week my training sessions get fucked up by random folks or their kids coming up behind me then touching the dog as I'm working with it.  I really can't stand it when they *call the dog to jump up on them.*  I can catch them if they're coming from the sides or in front of me, but when I'm working the dogs and their owners and they come up from behind, I usually don't see them until there's a hand near the dog's face.

It pisses these folks off when I tell them not to touch the dog because it's in training.  I really want to ask them how they'd feel if someone just ran up behind their child and picked her/him up and gave it a kiss on the cheek?  And that's still not incorporating the risk of freaking out a skittish dog and causing it to snarl or bite.  People usually don't bite, even when they're freaked out...

I can't believe this isn't common courtesy knowledge.  Maybe it's because I grew up around dogs and have worked with them for seven years...  But it's still unbelievable to me."

129,[Help] Neverending allergies and concurrent infections; our pup is suffering.,dogs,t3_aa1of8,20,False,False,aa1of8,"\[Help\]  My husband and I rescued my dog, an AmStaff, 1.5 years ago and he's currently 3.5 years old.  He had red paws and itchiness when we first got him, which was diagnosed as allergies by our first, local vet.  This began our neverending battle with allergic reactions and skin infections. (He turns tomato red, licks constantly, has broken skin w/ pustules at times, and often carries concurrent infections. Sometimes I wonder if the skin infection is truly a by-product of the allergic reactions or if he has an ongoing infection separately and in addition to his allergies.) The thing is, his issues have gotten exponentially worse with time.  Last winter he was fairly decent, but this winter he is miserable without some combination of ketoconazole (antifungal), apoquel, and cephalexin (antibiotic) and, sometimes, even when medicated he is still bright red and absolutely miserable.  The vets claim it's because he's allergic to non-seasonal triggers (mold, food) but that doesn't seem plausible to me, because then he would have reacted similarly last year, no? We've seen 4 vets and they all give the same advice (more drugs, more drugs, more drugs) but I've had my own experiences with constant antibiotic/medication use and know first-hand the repercussions.  I cringe every time I give him his medicine at this point and am emotionally exhausted from seeing him suffer and feeling powerless to help. We've had him allergy-tested and he's allergic to so much that I feel like he might have immune confusion, histamine intolerance and/or mast cell activation disorder; vets don't seem to want to entertain that possibility though. Here's a list of what we've tried and/or are currently trying:

* Specialized diet (removed offending foods; fed only freeze-dried and frozen raw)
* Allergy-testing (allergic to many proteins and peas, along with grasses, trees, weeds, and some molds)
* Low-dose immunotherapy shots and sublinguals (started with shots - total nightmare, so switched to sublinguals; over-reacted to the triggers so took him off it)
* Apoquel  (as needed; makes him lethargic and cuts allergic response in half)
* Antibiotics (specifically cephalexin, aka keflex; so many rounds I can't count)
* Ketoconazole (antifungal; daily - absolutely terrible for his liver)
* Medicated shampoos (once weekly; seems to temporarily kill bacteria and yeast but also irritates his already damaged skin)
* Non-histamine producing probiotics (daily)
* S. Boulardii probiotic when not taking Ketoconazole to see if that would reduce yeast issues (didn't notice a difference)
* Digestive enzymes (daily)
* Immune support supplement ([Thorne's Immugen](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/immugen-reg) for dogs)
* Kidney glandular supplements (for DAO supplementation to reduce histamine; no noticeable improvement)
* [Histoplex supplement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073G7N2G5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) by Biotics Research (no noticeable difference)
* Betadine spray and liquid betadine for his skin (seems to help but it stings and he hates it)
* Quercetin w/ Bromelain (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Benadryl and Quercetin (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Pollock Oil (anti-inflammatory; improvement in coat and skin but not irritation/reaction)
* CBD oil for inflammation and discomfort (just started)
* Redonyl Ultra (just started; contains PEA and omegas; hoping it stabilizes mast cells and helps his skin)

I'm sure I'm missing something but this is where we're at.  Any help at all would be much appreciated.  We're so desperate at this point. :-(   Thanks, everyone.

My Doodle is acting very out of character; hiding, wont go near the puppy, scared. He loves other dogs and is usually so playful with them but he seems terrified of the new pup.
Is this normal behavior?"
131,[Breeds] What breeds would be right for me?,dogs,t3_aa1kjj,6,False,False,aa1kjj,"Hi r/dogs! I am currently a grad student and could not take care of a doggo right now. Being a (good) dog owner is definitely a goal in my life so I wanted to be a bit proactive now, and look into what companion would be best for me in 2-3 years..

**Introduction**

 * *Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?* 

Yes! I have no experience.

* *Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?*

 I would prefer going through a reputable breeder, especially since I might be interested in showing my dog.

* *Describe your ideal dog.* 

I would like my dog to be my companion. They would be fairly easily trained and more on the quiet side. I'd like them to be playful without being overly excited.

* *What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?* 

I live in a small apartment so toy breeds are definitely what I am looking into. Most of my family is in Europe and I like that I could bring my dog with me in the cabin when flying (I think the max. weight is 16lbs?). I was interested in long-coated Chihuahuas especially. I loved the look of toy Eskies but I hear they love to bark, which my neighbours would never forgive me for, same for Pomeranians. I also liked Italian Greyhounds. In any case I am open to suggestions!

* *What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?* 

Definitely basic obedience. Like I mentioned, if they can, I think it might be fun to go to dog shows - I really like the idea of my dog and I having our own special activity. Later on I might be interested in fostering seeing-eye dogs in training, so a dog that can get along with other dogs would be ideal.

**Care Commitments**

*  *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*  

I don't have an clear idea of what my dog would need in terms of training, but I thought I would be interacting with him pretty much constantly when at home.


*  *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?* 

I would like a total of 90 minutes/day split into maybe 2-3 walks, or smaller walks + going to the dog park. I also want my dog to either go to daycare during workdays, or at least be visited my a walker once a day.

*  *How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?* 

I am open to it completely, I hope my dog can be too! I would rather avoid going to a professional and save money that way.

**Personal Preferences**

  *  *What size dog are you looking for?* 

A mini one! Definitely toy or a small breed.

*  *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?* 

Medium shedding, although these are things can be dealt with. I am much less open to barking, so minimal barking.

* *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?* 

Not very. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

  *  *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?* 

Very much a snuggly one, otherwise I'd get a cat XD. I do worry about separation anxiety though..

  *  *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?* 

 Since I am a beginner, I think an eager-to-please dog would be easier for me, although there are limits - didn't someone post about their dog pooing to please them?? XD Yeah, I'd rather not, thanks dog.

  *  *How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?* 

By coming to me first I guess? With some curiosity but not bother visitors.

 * *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?* 

No. I don't know what I could do if my dog were aggressive in daycare for example..

  *  *Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?* 

Barking is the big one, I guess things like puppy biting and walking on a leash can be taught or addressed so I can't think of anything else.

**Lifestyle**

  * *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?* 

I am very much looking for remote positions but I will most probably work 9-5 so doggo would be left alone 4 hours before being walked, and 4 hours before I come home. I am looking into daycares.

  *  *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?* I will be the sole caretaker of the dog.

  *  *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?* 

I want to foster seeing-eye puppies in the future, or at least get other dogs.

 *  *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?* No.

  *  *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?* 

Yes, I rent. There are no specific restrictions but the dog should be well-behaved. I think having an obedience certificate might be an asset but that is just my opinion. In the future, if the gods smile upon me and I am able to ever afford a house, you bet I'd like big dogs.

  *  *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?* 

I am currently in Montreal, Canada, but I may move upon graduation. The city currently taxes pitbull owners.

  *  *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?* 

Summer: 25-28 Celsius or 77-82 Fahrenheit although climate change is hitting us hard and we had weeks at 35-42°C or 95-107°F. Winter: 0°C to - 20°C or 32°F to -4°F

**Additional Information and Questions**

  *  *Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.* I don't have a car, and don't plan on getting one. 

   * * Feel free to ask any questions below.*
I would like to know how much daycare is costing you guys, or if you have tips on finding reputable breeders and dog walkers.. I am curious to hear all your experiences and feedback! Thanks for reading all of this!

133,[Discussion] Big dog being slightly aggressive towards small dog,dogs,t3_aa4rr4,1,False,False,aa4rr4,"So, we just got a new dog last week. I believe the breed is Lhasa Apso. He was abandoned and we adopted him from the shelter. He's about one year old they said. He's a good little guy. He has a calm demeaner, and it seems like he had started training. He follows behind you when you're walking, knows to stay and sit, and he loves playing with his toys. He has no behavioral issues from what I can tell.

Our old dog died about 6 months ago and she was about 15 and never really played with our old dog much for the last year of her life.

Our other dog is an 8 year old husky heeler mix. He's super high energy, my mom has trained him to demand attention. She has coddled him the past six months since her other dog died. So he follows her everywhere, gets up in your face if you aren't petting him, expects to be fed at the dinner table. All fine, but I think it contributes to his issues with the new dog.

We made sure both dogs were okay with each other before we adopted him and the adoption lady said everything seemed fine and we took him home.

Well it's been a little over a week now and our old dog is really aggressive with the new dog. When the new dog has a toy, the old dog comes over rips it away from him and takes it back to his bed and leaves it there. If the small dog tries to grab it, the old dog growls or snaps at him. When they're both outside, if I throw a toy and the small dog reaches it first, the big dog kinda shoves him and rips it away. If the small dog is getting pet, the big dog stares at the small dog and starts growling. If the small dog tries to sleep in the room with the big dog(my parents room) the big dog growls or takes up more room so the small dog can't stay.

As a result, the poor guy sleeps on the couch all day and doesn't get to go to his bed. He won't go in the room where my parents sleep unless he's walking with someone else. He doesn't get to play with any toys and he always looks so sad. I try to give him the attention he is lacking, cause he is just a pup still, he deserves someone spending time with him. But I can't do that all day. My mom, who stays home all day, says they just need time and it's perfectly normal. But I can't help feel that if the old dog is not disciplined for his behavior, he'll normalize this and not change.

So I'm just curious on what we can do better? What can I do to make the small dog happy? Do they need time? Am I doing something wrong? Does the old dog need discipline? I just don't want this new dog feeling left out. We brought him home with the promise to love him and I don't think he feels at home. Sorry if this seems stupid, I just want to correct this early so it doesn't remain a problem."

Every time when i lay down he starts crying (only when we are alone in the room) like asking for attention, when i do give him attention bcz i'm trying to make him quiet and let me sleep, he gets serious for a sec, and then tries to hump me.

So i was laying and he started to you know, move and stuff, so i was like, ok he will stop soon, but he didn't i put a pillow next to him so he won't get close to me and he starts humping it.

I don't want my dog to hump me, nobody fu**ing wants that. So after he finished, with the pillow came the punishment and then he was acting normal again for the rest of the night.

Today was a normal day, and he acted as nothing ever happened, acted normal and quiet. 
Until now, i just layed down, and he again starts crying, every time he does i sprinkle (i don't know the word sorry) regular water which i poured into a bottle for cleaning.

This has never happened in those 10 years, and i do know it's not bcz he wants attention, he just got 100% lust, from yesterday both i and the clothes were washed so ofc there is no scent of the female pug. He haven't been through castration, and it's too late for that as well.

I hope you could help me with this, i'm tired and i can't sleep next to him crying ((it's 1:30 here)he sleeps in the bed with me) it's annoying and I'm sensitive hearing people/ animals suffer, so every time he cries i get mad bcz i know he isn't suffering but just baiting me to comfort him, and i am afraid of harming him bcz usually if he gets hit by something he like screams a bit, but when i push him to go away from me he is too stubborn, he continues trying without stoping, and i don't want to hurt him.

So, I have a 4 year old Shih Tuz Yorkie named Beans, I love him and he’s great even though he has his moments. For some reason his dick is always out. Sometimes it’s just the tip other times it’s a good inch. Whenever people meet him I can tell it makes them uncomfortable. Even I think it’s gross and awkward when it’s just out, I’ll say “Beans, put your dick away you perv”, I get no response.  He’s a really cute dog so I get a lot of people who want to meet him and cuddle with him. I’ve taken him to the vet twice, payed 40$ for the vet to just flip his skin back over his dick.  Which was pointless because when we got home it was out again! I cut the hairs around his dick Incase they were getting in the way of him pulling it back in. That maybe him licking himself was to try and lubreacte it or something. I tell him to stop every time I see him licking himself and then don’t make eye contact. Sometimes, like if it’s really cold or for some unknown reason, he puts it away but only for a few hours.

I know she is a dog and not a creepy person, but subconsciously I found the incident disturbing.  I think this caused me having trouble bonding with her.  I didnt really want to pet her very much.  The other thing that hurt our bond is she was constantly chasing my cats and tormenting them.  This behavior is better, but I love my cats to death and I was very upset that they no longer wanted to come out and cuddle but hide from her.  Most of my cats are back to normal now, took about 6 months, but I have one that has become so reclusive we had to give her her own room.  Whenever I go into this cat's room, the dog will sit outside and whimper loudly, which scares my cat who needs my love and care.  Right now she is so scared she refuses to come out of the closet and I need total quiet to get her to come out so I can pet her and bring her to her water and food bowl.  Yes, this is my cats fault, the dog has not actually chased her in a long time, and the cat has also become afraid of the other cats too.  The cat needs help.  I am aware.  However, that doesn't change the fact that I want my dog to go away from outside the cat's room door when I am attending to the cat.

As I type this I am in my bedroom and she is in the dining room outside my bedroom and she is whimpering.  She whimpers constantly.  It is high pitched, whiny, loud, and obnoxious.  Sometimes the reasons why are obvious, like there's a thunderstorm, and that is fine.  I always let her come in my room then and it usually helps.  However, most of the times the reasons I believe are due to anxiety, but I often can't pinpoint what.  For example, today I was in the kitchen making a bowl of yogurt, and she just starts whining.  No reason at all.  Just. Whining.

She also hyperventilates about 90% of the time and this will often turn in to whimpers and whines when she gets too worked up.  She'll start by panting/ loudly breathing really fast and intensely.  She will do this for hours and hours.  I have been around dogs my whole life, and it is much quicker than normal.  I have even had visitors comment on it, so I know its not just me, but the vet says it is fine.  I also was around a bunch of dogs over Christmas, and it stunned me at how CALM they were in comparison to her, even with all the people around.  So anyway, when her breathing really speeds up, she will kind of turn the breaths into whimpers and then start whimpering for a while.  She can control it too.  When I tell her to hush and look at her, she stops until I look away and then starts again.  The only time she doesnt do this is when she is asleep, which isn't very often.

I have really bad anxiety, and trouble with tachycardia, and this causes my anxiety and tachycardia to go through the roof.  When shes breathing quickly and anxiously it causes my heart rate to skyrocket and I need to either get away from her or take some propanolol which my doctor prescribed to lower my heart rate.  I try to mentally turn it off and ignore it but I cannot.  It is so loud and all encompassing.  She also will often follow on my heels whatever part of the house I am at- her nose a few inches from my butt - on high alert and follow (while panting of course).  That is OBNOXIOUS.  If she is not doing that she is usually staring at me with her ears up, trying to get my attention while doing her hyper pants and will not let me relax.  I just want to be able to read my Kindle or tend to my indoor plants or do something in peace.  As a result of this behavior I have stopped spending time in my living room and just go in my bedroom where I can keep her away.  in the 10% of the time she is calm and relaxed, I always make a point to praise her, and tell her she is a good girl, but it doesnt seem to be helping much.  As a result, my relationship with my cats suffers more.  Also I enjoy(ed) using other parts of the house.

At night she will sometimes go sleep at her doggy pillow (preferred, and this is far away from our bedroom), but when she gets bored she will get up and whimper outside our door.  She also has these loud jarring yelps that she will do when she wants to go outside.  I absolutely do not allow her to go outside until we wake up.  She always gets a chance to go to the bathroom before we got o bed.  Unfortunately my husband will sometimes go and let her out at 5AM.  I am not okay with this and have asked him not to, because it shows her that these yelps will get her what she wants.  She has the tendency to do this right when I am falling in to REM.  They are not like normal person walking by the house barks- which don't annoy me.  These are insidious in that they have the ability to rouse me from a deep sleep and completely recondition my brain so that I cannot go back to sleep for about 90 minutes.  They are extremely loud too.  It is like flipping a switch in my brain, and she knows it.  It is effective, it gets us up and gets my husband to let her outside.  As a result, I have been sleeping with these over the ear head phones, like the ones that you would use at a gun range...  they help in that I dont hear her nearly as often.  Ear plugs are not enough.  The headphones drown out almost all whimpers and about 75% of the yelps.  However this is not sustainable.  For one, they hurt my ear and neck, and are ripping at my hair.  More importantly, I am due in 2 months to have a baby and I will need to be able to hear him when he wakes.  I know I will be very sleep deprived soon because of the baby, and I don't need the dog contributing to this!  I also do not want these yelps and whimpers waking the baby.  In addition, like the cats room, whenever I go into the nursery I am preparing she starts loudly whining and whimpering.   This is absolutely unacceptable.  I can't have her doing this whenever I bring him to his changing table to change his diaper, or go to put in him or check on him in his crib, or any other reason I am in there.  

She will also do these bark/ yelps I mentioned for outside when she wants back inside, in the day or whenever.  I would prefer that she wait quietly by the door - we can see her.  I only let her inside when she has not barked for a few minutes, and this does seem to be helping somewhat.  Again my husband often will let her back inside when she yelps, which only enforces the behavior.

She has a clean bill of health for her age - only some minor pain in her back that the vet doesnt think should be bothering her too much.  All of the rest of her is in working order and the vet is not concerned about the excessive hyper panting, even though I can't imagine it is healthy and have never seen it before in another dog.  She is intelligent and picks up new tricks quickly, and was also well trained before we adopted her - she rarely goes to the bathroom in the house (and if she does its usually because we forgot to walk her or we were out all day, so its not her fault) doesn't sit on or paw on furniture, chew up the house, etc.  If it weren't for the excessive noise and hyper activity, she would be a great dog, but I just cannot relax around her and I am at my wits end.  If I cannot fix these behaviors and they cause more problems with the baby I don't know what I am going to do.  It would kill my husband if I were to rehome her - she's his first dog and even though the problems bother him he is attached to her.  I've never even thought about wanting to rehome a pet before, and I have never had a dog or cat I couldn't bond with, besides her.  Its also not like the dog doesn't know that these behaviors are problems - like I said she is smart.  Any advice on how to train her to calm down and be quiet?"

143,[Help] Senior Dog Increasingly Aggressive,dogs,t3_aa3nki,4,False,False,aa3nki," 

So our 13 year old 32 lb corgi-Sheppard mix has been with me since 2007. Since I adopted him, he's been a great dog with energy and playfulness...etc...until recently. Almost 2 years ago my wife and I had a daughter, who has now taken attention off the dog. As a result, our dog has been unruly and jealous when it comes to our daughter. He has always been food aggressive and protective of his bow, but now that food aggressiveness has extended into aggressively stealing food from our daughter, and attempting to jump up and get food off of her highchair. He seems to think there's always food being given out and he has to steal it. I can have nothing in my hand and I'll pass by him and he will jump out and nibble at my had as if I had some food for him. He has a full bowl of his own food and water available to him at all times, but I'm not sure if he's just forgetting where it is? It's empty in the morning so he does find it and eat it. He does display some symptoms of dementia as he will randomly whine and seem to get ""lost"" in the house. I've recently ordered him some multivitamins and some CBD oil via Amazon and am hoping that helps calm him down. He seems in pain in his hips as he doesn't like to be picked up or moved anymore. In fact, if you pick him up he will snarl and bark viciously at you, and depending on who you are he will bite at you to let you know he doesn't want to be picked up. The other odd behaviors when it comes to our daughter is he will go to her door at night and sniff at the bottom of it, and try to get it open so he can get in. He used to get her door open at our old house where our handles were horizontal and not round. I'm not sure how to discourage this behavior (or if I should just open the door?). In the past he just would lay by the crib, but this behavior wakes my daughter up during her nap during the day. As far as how he normally interacts with her, he's fine, and my daughter is learning to gently pet him. Sometimes he gets in her space though and when she goes to ""push"" him away, he does that snarling/barking aggressiveness toward her without biting (at which point I have to tell my daughter to be gentle with him, but at the same time, she doesn't want him stealing her food o\_O). During the day he sleeps upstairs in his doggy bed in the master bedroom, but at night, he likes to not be in the same room as us, and sleep on the couch in the living room. When it's just my wife and my daughter at home, he sleeps upstairs like everything is fine. But if my wife, daughter, and I, are all home and downstairs, he will come downstairs and act jealous through excessively barking for attention (and even after we give him attention he still barks for attention). We tried various bark collar solutions and the only thing that we've found to keep our sanity is a muzzle, but that only lasts so long as he will eventually start to whine and cry to get it off. So we will take it off of him and he will eventually start barking again. At this point, my wife and I are doing our best, but our old doggo is driving us up a wall and we're not sure what to do. Any advice or explanation of his behavior would really help."
144,[Help] Dog poop problems,dogs,t3_aa3gfo,10,False,False,aa3gfo,"Ok, I'll try and be as quick and succinct as possible. We have a 15 year old dachshund who took to pooping in her crate overnight. She'd poop in there and then bark until we came in to clean it up. She'd do it even if we let her out right before bed and she pooped then. We feed her once a day in the morning right after we let her out. 

To stop the barking and to hopefully stop her being trapped in her poop until we could clean it, we stopped keeping her in her kennel at night and started just leaving her locked in the bathroom with potty pads. That stopped the barking, but it didn't stop the pottying. Oddly enough, even though she had plenty of room and could get away from it, she would poop and then smash the poop down flat on the floor (it looked like she finger painted in there every morning and every bit of poop would be smashed flat). 

So she'd have to have a bath and I'd have to get down and scrub the floor every morning. Even if we tried to paper the floor with puppy pads. 

The last couple of nights we've tried switching her to diapers. That's worked for the mess- she still pees and poops in the diapers but at least it's not all over the floor. Today, however, after I took the diaper off and put her outside I noticed she was straining to poop again. She passed some but kept straining even though no more was showing. 

Using a wipe I cleaned up her bum and tried to see if there was something stuck and she passed the last little bit of poop. There was a little bit of blood but she still kept straining. After another few minutes, she got more poop out and then seemed ok.  

However, according to my wife (she's at home, I'm at work) the dog is asking to go out every few minutes and straining while she's out there. She's also pooped a bit more in her bed twice (solid) and just keeps straining every half an hour or so and generally doesn't seem as if she's comfortable. 

She's never been an 'eater' (that is, she doesn't chew on stuff or eat random things off the ground). She IS passing stool and it's normal consistency, not diarrhea or especially hard. There's been just a touch of blood but no more than I'd expect from just a sore bum. 

Any other thoughts what it may be before I get her into the vet? "

146,[Help] Is it ever too late to train a dog not to bark?,dogs,t3_aa18zi,4,False,False,aa18zi,"Hello!

My 2,5 year old dog (terrier/pinscher mix) barks a lot, especially outside at other dogs and I am overchallenged with it. I am suffering from social anxiety and the looks people give you when your dog is barking is really too much for me and I don't like it when other people make a mean comment regarding my dog, since I truly love her and of course don't want anyone to insult her. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory: My mom and I got the dog together but she mostly had her and was basically the ""pack leader"". Our girl was always way more quiet when I had her and when she barked my mother only rant at her until she stopped. Over the years it got more and more out of control and we got a muzzle which I kept using when she barked and it was really a help. My mother wasn't using it though because ""she looked so awful"" with it. We often kept fighting about it but she never really used it. 

Well now my mom isn't there anymore (not dead) and I have the dog alone and she is seeing me as her leader now. While she isn't barking much at home, she basically always barks at other dogs outside. At home I can easily use the muzzle and I really see that it is helping, but outside it's different. When we see another dog I always try to change the street or something but sadly that's not always possible and honestly I rather want to solve the problem now and not just runaway from it. 

Now you're probably wondering why I don't use the muzzle outside - my dog isn't walking when she wears it. At home she is moving a little bit like getting on the bed and walking towards me but if we are outside she doesn't even walk if I pull the leash a bit. She is just standing there and I'd basically had to drag her behind me to get her going, but of course that's not the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be very thankful for any help and advice since it's taking a toll on my social anxiety and I'd really like my dog and me to have a good time outside."

148,[Help] Housemates beginning to not get along.,dogs,t3_a9zvzr,11,False,False,a9zvzr,"First post here, but I'm stumped as to how to advise my parents on their dogs. Sorry if I'm a little disjointed or if the formatting is off, there's a bit to unpack here. 

   A little bit of background: They have two dogs (and one cat). Both dogs are the same breed (American Bulldog) and sex (female), but differ in age. The older dog is around 7, the younger dog is nearing 2. Older Dog came from a shady breeder as the runt and we suspect she was abused before we got her, although it doesn't seem to affect her regarding aggression towards people or other dogs. She plays well with others and is very much a people pleaser. 

   Younger dog on the other hand, is a little...off. She came from much better beginnings than older dog, but has ended up with a mild form of congenital ataxia. Whereas older dog was a very easy to train dog, younger dog is slow to pick up commands and very hardheaded. Younger dog also is very easily scared, but will respond with aggression. (Example: Her and older dog on a play date with another dog, Younger dog took a potshot she almost regretted but Older Dog stepped in and defended her until people came to break them up.)

&amp;#x200B;

We've been noticing a disturbing trend between the two dogs though. Younger dog is starting to pick fights with the older dog. Older dog will do her best to try to prevent a fight, but Younger dog is so bullheaded that she keeps on until Older Dog can't take it anymore. Fights will erupt (all instigated by the younger dog) over affection, food, toys, and occasionally an unknown stimulus. Older dog will give younger dog a wide berth because she doesn't want to fight (doesn't like making my mom or dad upset) and will avoid as much as she can until she can't. 

Usually when a fight erupts it's after Younger Dog stares down Older Dog (with Older Dog avoiding looking at her). Younger Dog will take a potshot, and then it's on. Older Dog, despite being avoidant, will throw down when she has to. The fight I witnessed happened behind me after I gave older dog some attention. Younger dog stared down and took her shot, tried to take older dog down and got grounded by Older Dog. Older dog will not clamp down to draw blood, but will pin Younger dog down by the throat until she stops fighting. However, the second Older Dog releases, Younger dog is right back up snapping and snarling until Older Dog puts her down again. 

This is different from their play fights. I feel this is a challenge situation over resources (including affection). But we don't know what to do about it. I'm not so worried about having to break them up because for now fights are only occurring when people are home. My concern is what will happen if a fight breaks out and nobody is home. I don't think Younger Dog will stop. I think she'll keep on and keep on until both of them are tired or one of them wins. And I feel bad for the older dog as well. She shouldn't be slinking around the house hiding and trying to avoid a fight from the younger dog because she was there first. My Mom has thought about rehoming the Younger Dog, but is worried that with her ataxia (mild as it is, she's just forever going to be a little clumsy like a puppy with paws too big for their legs) rehoming will be hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to tell them. I did tell mom it wouldn't be as hard as she thinks to rehome for such a mild neurological issue, but I understand that she would rather find a way to solve the issue in the house. All issues aside, Younger dog can be incredibly sweet. None of us like how it's affecting Older dog though, because this was her home first. 

Is there anyone else that has had experience with this issue? What did you do to remedy it? Or is rehoming the only answer?

155,[Breeds] Am I a stupid idiot for wanting a German Sheperd as my first dog post-phobia?,dogs,t3_aa2isp,19,False,False,aa2isp,"Hey all,

So 2016 - 2018 was the two-year period where I kicked my phobia of dog's ass - note, I didn't kick the ass of any dogs during this period, that would be awful - and now I'm at the point where I can confidently be around dogs and it's like I'm not even around em. I've been looking into dogs, and I think a German Sheperd would be a good choice.

Here are some facts that might be helpful for you guys:

I'm 18, but I won't be going to college (called University here in the UK) for a good two years, maybe even three, and all I'm doing is my post-high school study called A levels. This means that I have a lot of time to devote to dog walking, training, all that.

I am financially stable as I saved a lot of money from when I wasn't in education and I receive a monthly sum anyways. This means that I am certainly not unable to provide for the dog.

I have a lot of space - I live in a three bedroom house with a garden, and one of the bedrooms is unused, as well as the dining room. 

I hear that German Sheperds are quite clingy and love to be around family, which I think would be a lot of fun as I can 100% provide the time commitments (practically) all year around. If I was to get a GS, I would choose my University accomondation accordingly; I want to make it clear to you guys that I am fully committed to raising the dog!

EDIT: I'd like to point out that I just realised that I have a very active lifestyle that might really benefit a GS - I follow a military routine (long story, not in the Army atm but I really enjoyed the training haha), this includes sprinting on some days, running every day; generally good cardio stuff that (I'm pretty sure) the dog would enjoy.

I don't live with babies or small children. I live with my dad who is a warehouse worker who is constantly active, and my brother who isn't around too much.

QUESTIONAIRRE:

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Zero dog experience, but I love the buggers now that I got over the phobia. First dog, but not the first dog in the family - my dad had a dog growing up.


2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?


* No preference.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.


* Loyal, physical enough that I can have fun with it when I go out on runs and the like, protective.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* GS, they look adorable and I would like a tough yet loving dog. They seem very loyal too.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Guard-type stuff, but I may be able to get in touch with my friend who is a K9 trainer in the Army (the lucky git)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Literally as much as I need. I'm out monday-friday from 9AM to 5PM, but the evening is the dogs, and so is the weekend. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* See my main post, I do a lot of cardio and strength exercises outdoors and this seems like perfect GS territory.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Totally open to that! We have HEPA air filters at my house that are rated for dogs so I don't even need to worry about annoying hairs, and no one has allergies either :)

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

*Medium - big. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*Infinite, haha. I think it goes with the territory of owning a GS.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*Not important, but if I had to do that I wouldn't mind!

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

*Is there such a thing as a mixture of both? I'd lead more toward snuggly though.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

*Eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

*Wouldn't mind them making noise when someone knocks on the door. We rarely get visitors but it would be nice if they were friendly with them up to a certain level.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*Yep!

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
Nothing that comes to mind as long as it isn't biting me a lot haha

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

*9 AM to 5PM when I'm at college, 9 AM to 3PM on Tuesdays. Family will be in but they have less dog experience.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

*Family are indifferent, but they'd feed the dog if needed.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*I mean, I might get a goldfish or something at some point, but no other four-legged friends!

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

*No. Very, very rarely - if ever.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

*No restrictions on dogs where I live, and I'll actually cater renting my Uni dwellings around the dog.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*UK, and the only restrictions are on the ""killer breeds"" that are bred to be violent; GS doesn't count.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*Summer days - Highs of 22 degrees celsius and lows of 11. Roughly 70 deg fahrenheit high and 51 degree low.

*Winter days - Really depends as the UK has a weird climate. Lows of -1 C (30 F) and highs of 7 or 8 (45 degrees) depending on the day. Lots and lots of rain though."

157,[Help] My senior dog is having a very bad post seizure recovery and is extremely hungry,dogs,t3_aa22bc,3,False,False,aa22bc,"My 13 year old pug started having seizures when she was around 9, they lasted about 30 seconds and she was perfectly normal right after. 

Two months ago she started having grand mal seizures that lasted about 3 minutes and were quite violent with a recover period of about 2-3 hours of disorientation. I started her on CBD oil and didn't have a seizure for a month. I switched to a pet specific one and I think the dosage was lower and I didn't realize I was only giving her 2.5mg instead of 5mg (20lb dog). She started having seizures again. Had 4 in one day and no amount of CBD seemed to help so I brought her to the emerg vet who gave me phenobarbital and gabapentin.

This was 24 hours ago and her seizures have stopped but her recovery phase is much much worse. She's been just screaming for the past 20 hours and her back legs barely work now. She's ravenously hungry, which I've read is fairly normal post seizure. But I think the screaming is from how hungry she is. I went to my regular vet to get something to sedate her because this dog usually sleeps 15 hours a day but has had maybe 4 hours of sleep. She was given valium and it helped her sleep for maybe 2 hours before she woke up and started screaming again. Food is the only thing that calms her down and she eats it like she's been starved. When I touch her, she sniffs my hand to see if I have food and will nibble a bit on anything around her mouth.

I'm worried it's all neurological and no amount of food with satiate her. I don't want to over feed her but I wonder how much can I give. After the first few seizures, she was running around constantly. 

I just want her to get some rest have to have the screaming stop. Has anyone had a similar experience?

TL;DR Dog had 4 bad seizures in one day. Is on phenobarbital and valium for it now and the seizures have stopped but she's screaming constantly and I think it's from hunger. Is it safe to over feed her or should I be doing something else to sooth her?"
158,[Help] The Worst Start to Owning a Puppy Ive Ever Had (on the verge of a breakdown).,dogs,t3_aa1qnt,12,False,False,aa1qnt,"I've always grown up owning dogs. I firmly believe man should grow with a dog to some extent. I recently became a licensed nurse, started making more, and finally got to a point where I could own a dog. A puppy even, if I made the needed adjustments. I work out as much as I can throughout the week, so the dog could get plenty of exercise under my care. Seriously I had thought of all the necessary provisions, dog sitters, food, researched breeds, kept tabs on the market, etc. I had it all planned out. Even though I work night shift mostly, I could make it work. I refuse to believe that I can't do this just because I'm single living in a 2bed apartment. And when he gets older, I can always drop him off at my mom's omw to work bc she has a huge backyard and that would be good for him to stretch his legs during the hours I work.

My sister, who lives in Denver, finds a puppy she wants out in the state I live. She asks me to get it for her and she will venmo me the money. It's a Boston terrier pup. Cute Lil thing, but he adjusted extremely well. I was able to play with the pup, attempted to train here and there, and even had a dog sitter for it. Now, the breeder I'm buying from fails to mention he will be out the day I wanna buy the dog, so now I'm pressed to buy sooner. I buy him yesterday early morning thinking I'm gonna have all day and night with the pups and then I'd have a dog sitter for the next day. His name is Roy and he's a border collie.

11:00pm rolls around last night (12/26/18) and I get a call from my work, ""where are you? You're supposed to be here."" Apparently, my schedule was changed without my knowing. Now I'm in full blown panic mode. What the hell do I do now? I start calling ppl up left n right, hitting up dog sitters via Rover - nothing. I tell my date that I had earlier that day (I didn't leave the two pups alone for more than an hour btw) my situation, not realizing she would volunteer to help. So she says she will take care of them for the night at her place. Not ideal, but I can't deny that opportunity. So I do this. Now I have them back, trying to get some sleep before I have to work a freaking double from 3pm to 7am which was also scheduled without my knowing. Now I'm on the verge of a complete breakdown. I haven't been able to give Roy a good couple of days all bc of some bs with work and I'm thinking this will dramatically affect him. I can't get him to use puppy pads and I wasn't able to introduce the crate to him in a positive way at all. Idk what to do and I feel like I'm overwhelmed and drowning. Like I'm genuinely about to cry and freak out bc I didn't plan on it being so rough for Roy. For the record, the Boston terrier is named Austin and he's been doing really well, but Roy isn't. I put them both in the same kennel (it's a large kennel) to see if it would help Roy but it doesn't. He is constantly freaking out like how I am right now lol. Idk if I'm going to be able to keep up. How fucked up is this situation and am I being too dramatic here? Should I call the breeder and send the puppy back bc I am on total freak out mode and suddenly feel like I cant do this anymore. Like Roy had such a bad first day that I feel I  can't even repair whatever trauma he may or may not have undergone moving around so much."

161,[help] what should we be looking for in a rescue/rescue dog?,dogs,t3_aa17l1,32,False,False,aa17l1,"TL;DR: are we asking too much for a rescue dog from a North West shelter? Dogs that fit this description are gone within the day and rescues keep sticking their nose up at us. Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog. 

Our wishlist for a dog: prefer small but only needs to be under 120 lbs (apartment restriction), cannot be a pit, gsd, or husky, must get along with other dogs and people, energetic and athletic, between 1 to 4 years old,

Sorry for the wall of text. This started as a question and has kind of turned into a vent with hope for advice.

So my husband and I are looking at getting another dog. We are having serious issues with finding a compatible dog and I am wondering if we are just asking too much or if we are just not looking in the right places.

Background: We are both from the south but are in the North West. We are definitely having a problem getting use to a completely different culture surrounding dog adoption. We are use to having tons of good dogs looking for adoption for anywhere from $25 to $100. Here the cheapest county shelter is $250, private groups start at $500, and the dogs are gone within a day or two.

We have decided to get an adult dog from a shelter for the ease and to skip the terrible puppy  stage. I have only ever had a dog I raised from puppyhood. My husband has never had a puppy and got his dogs as adults, but they also only had one dog at a time and the dogs were outdoor only dogs.

We have a 7 year old border collie mix who has lived with as many as 5 other dogs in a house and has never had any serious issues with any of them. She will never start fights, however, she won't run away when attacked either.

Problem: we have been looking at dogs since September and cannot seem to find a good match. We did adopt one dog in September but as soon as she became comfortable in the house it became apparent she was large dog/fear aggressive and would constantly attack our current dog (mostly over resources and proximity). This led to us returning her for fear that we end up having an ER visit or worse due to the fights (it got very close to needing an ER visit twice in the month we had her). It was a costly mistake as her adoption price was $575 and the rescue group black listed us because ""we didn't know how to handle dog with issues"". This rescue organization came highly recommend and they told us this dog ""didn't have an aggressive bone in her body"". They made no mention of issues before we adopted her but when I reached out to ask how to calm her down and get her more relaxed they told me ""she just needs time, she started fights when she first got here too"".

We decided to be more cautious, we have been more attuned to how our dog greets the other dog, how the rescue/shelter is organized, and really looking at the dog's personality. But so far we are always late and the dog is gone before we have made a decision on the dog.

We have also been avoided by a lot of rescues because we are young, in an apartment, and looking for a high energy dog. Our current dog is high energy and we really enjoy that energy level because we enjoy walking (walk a minimum of 2 30 minute walks a day), hiking, and are generally athletic people. I would also really like to get into dog sports. But the rescues always turn us to old, low energy dogs.I am really about to say let's save up and get a purebred puppy at this point even tho I hate the puppy phase.

Just in case you forgot (again sorry for the wall of text) the question is So are we asking too much? Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog.

164,[Help] Which breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_aa144t,2,False,False,aa144t,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It would be the first dog we own. I have an uncle that owned and trained several Rottweilers and German-Shepards. So I was often around dogs in my life. Also walked them and played with them etc.

My wife was also around dogs as a child but never owned one.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We would love to rescue a dog. However, depending on the breed we heard that one needs to be careful with rescue dogs. The uncle I mentioned above recommend me to not get a rescue dogs as ""you can get a lot of baggage you do not know about"".

Any additional advice from you would be very welcome.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

A companion that loves being around my wife an me. He should be able to spend time with either me or my wife without ""missing"" the other too much.

He should be be able to hang on the couch for some time but also love walks/hikes/jogging and should not have problems with other dogs or children. We are not looking for a guard dog. However, there are a lot of children and other dogs around our neighbourhood.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I always likes Labradors, however we might think that they might be too big for a first time dog. I hear a lot of recommendation for this one as a first time/family dog. I also have a thing for Welsh Corgis. I understand that they might be very active.

We both find Beagles could fit us very well.

My wife likes Dachshunds and other smaller breeds. She would prefer a dog that she can lift up if the situation requires it.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Walking along side us, fetch, sit, speak/quite. The usual I guess. Nothing too exotic I think.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1 hour should be possible every day. More on the weekends.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I think 30mins each day are possible. We both jog every other day. So the dog would come with us. On the off days we would go for walks or play fetch in the yard.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We would prefer a shorter coat. If necessary all grooming will be done for the dog. A professional would be used if totally necessary but is not preferred.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and Slobber can be handled a lot. The neighbours would probably prefer the barking to be at minimum. However, they also have dogs and they sometimes bark too.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

We would love to let the dog run free in safe area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly most of the time.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Is ""somewhere in between"" a possible answer? 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

As mentioned, we are not looking for a guard dog. Knocking at doors should preferably not be a problem. If someone enters the yard, it would be good if he barks.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Would be great if the dog does not like to eat shoes, cables or tv remotes. But hey...thats just something you have to deal with when owning a dog.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home about 90%. On the days that I would not be at home, my wife could take the dog to work with her. I neither works, the dog would stay in the yard for about 8 hours. However, I cannot imagine that happening very often. 

If we would be gone for longer, my parents can take care of the dog. They also have a big yard.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My wife loves dogs and wants one too. We would share the involvement 50/50.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not at the moment. We might be expecting our first child in 1-2 years.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We own a house with a yard in the suburbs. No intention of renting.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in Graz, Austria. No specific restrictions come to mind.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer 25 to 30 degrees celcius
Winter 5 to -10 degrees celcius

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We have a fenced yard that is about 120 square metres big.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

What do you guys think is the one thing that most newbies do not think about when getting a dog? We try to prepare as good as possible."
165,"[Discussion] Wow, kids be dumb. Parents need to do their job.",dogs,t3_a9pn7u,67,False,False,a9pn7u,"Christmas was interesting for our 3-month-old pup. He has met kids before when we take him to the park, but this week he met the family kids (ages 7-10). I thought they would be at least a little knowledgeable about how to behave with a dog because they all have their own. I definitely overestimated there.
 
The kids don't listen. The first thing they did was run screaming down the street towards me and the puppy. I held up my hand and yelled to stop and slow down. Kids continued and parents did nothing. 
 
Playing with my puppy involved chasing him, encouraging him to bite their hands and feet, backing him into corners, getting all up in his face... I tried so many times to stop the kids and explain that they needed to let pup get to know them, let him sniff them, etc and don't invade his personal space. I tried to teach them about his body language and when it means they should back off. They didn't adjust their behavior and I had to babysit.
 
Kids be dumb. One asked, ""How come he won't let me pet his belly?"" I'm like, ""How would you feel if someone you just met came up to you and rolled you onto your back to rub your belly?"" Didn't make the connection.
 
We went outside to walk pup after dinner. Kid comes with us. He's like, ""Are we gonna run him around soon? Cuz I'm getting bored."" I'm like, ""We're not out here to entertain you wtf?""
 
Most of my last two days have just been a stressful mess of me having to take my puppy away from the kids to protect him. Or getting discipliny with them because their parents are off having fun.
 
People kept asking me, why don't I take him off the leash inside? 1) because he is 3 months old and doesn't know how to stay alive and 2) the kids harass him.
 
I try to put pup down in his crate for naps and the kids come bursting in like ""NOOO why are you putting him in a cage??"" He's safe in there and it's naptime. How about someone put you in a cage."

Our in-laws love him but dont worry about or accept the same risks as us. For instance they let him out freely in the back yard (fenced) which concerns me because he likes to eat EVERYTHING. They don’t even crate him because my mother IL says it’s cruel to see dogs in crates, even after explaining how it works. We’ve never used the crate for punishment and at home, he even voluntarily goes in at bed time.

My Husky is very easy going and I wasn't necessarily worried when it did happen, but you might not be so lucky with another dog. I had both my dogs unleashed at an off leash park with no one around and I was about 15 ft away when my husky was doing his business. He likes a little privacy when he goes #2. Right in the middle of his dump a small child screams ""husky"" out of nowhere and runs directly for him. Before I could even get to him the child was already petting him and running off before I could even say a word. Luckily my shepherd isn't to keen on small children so she just avoids them by going the opposite direction. I understand dogs are the best thing when you're a child, but you never know what is going to happen. Next time they might not meet a well mannered pup who loves kids, next time they might accidentally surprise the dog and get nipped, next time they might get bitten badly.

181,"[discussion] I think my friend is about to buy from a puppy mill, how can i best warn him?",dogs,t3_a9txaq,15,False,False,a9txaq,"Friend is looking for a puppy. He has his heart set on Australian Shepherds, and found one available nearby.

Some of the ""red flags"" I've picked up talking to him:

 * They're breeding ""mini"" Australian Shepherds. That alone put me on alert, at least.
 * I'm aware Australian Shepherds are a popular breed at the moment and fairly susceptible to this kind of thing to start with.
 * ""Breeder"" seems to only have one or a few pairs of dogs that they repeatedly breed, all parents live with the breeder both moms and dads.
 * hip/knee checks are limited to ""my local vet says the parents are good"" and I'm unsure about eye testing - all three are recommended by akc for Aussies.
 * Breeder has lied to him about what to expect from the breed. They told him a mini Australian Shepherd will be a ""great apartment dog"" and only need a short daily walk for exercise and no mention of mental stimulation at all. I'm not worried about his ability to exercise the dog, he's a fairly active guy, but intentionally misinforming your pup's new parent rubs me the wrong way.
 * He's having difficulty getting them to commit to a home visit for the puppies, so he can see them prior to pickup.
 * No wait list, no interview, no meeting. He saw an add, said ""do you have a puppy for me"" and they said yes.
 * The dogs are CHEAP. They're asking for $500 CAD for the puppies, when he States other breeders in the area (many of whom also sound shady) were asking for 1200-2k. Breeder claims that this and the previous two points are due to the fact this is her last litter and she's getting out of breeding, due to being older and having some health conditions.

I told him these are red flags, but I believe he's blinded by cute puppies, and the fact he can actually afford them. Is there any good explanation for even some of this, and if you're all as wary as I am, is there anything else I can do or say to change his mind? Puppy pickup wouldn't be for another two weeks I believe, so maybe there's time.

182,[Help] Breeders and health testing importance/transparency,dogs,t3_a9wcac,12,False,False,a9wcac,"I made a post a couple days ago asking for opinions on a particular breeder. This brought up a some questions for me regarding health testing. I had contacted and asked the breeder for documentation, or something similar, that I could see just so I could see if their dogs really were tested for PRA, MDR1, etc. I did not receive anything official from them besides reassurance that their results are accurate based on lineage (linage was not provided and I searched OFA but had no luck). Looking at other breeder sites I've seen some dogs that have a simple description like ""MDR1: normal/mutant,"" while others have full pedigrees and include registration numbers to make it easier to look up their dogs and such. Others mention the names/locations of doctors who have examined their dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

When contacting breeders what exactly is a good response when asking about health testing? Is official documentation (a record from OFA or some other form of documentation) the main way to validate health tests or is verbal conformation that they do health tests typically what you get (i.e. ""this dog is not a carrier for \_\_\_\_"") ? I personally feel like breeders should have some sort of proof to present buyers, but is this considered too demanding/rude? This is my first experience with a breeder and I am honestly not sure what would be considered acceptable/rude on my side regarding this. I would appreciate any input! "
183,[help] my two month old Doberman puppy pees when she’s asleep (or very comfortable),dogs,t3_a9yged,9,False,False,a9yged,"I currently live in Venezuela, and the vet situation here is mediocre at best (hence why I’m posting). 

My 9 week old puppy Harley is happy and healthy in general, she has just had her first round of vaccinations 8 days ago. I feed Harley a combination of puppy food and a soup I cook biweekly composed of chicken stock, carrots, potatoes, pumpkin, and cubed beef liver. 

A few days ago she was napping on my lap and when she got up my shorts felt wet. And since then I’ve been noticing she leaves a wet spot wherever she sleeps or rests. Also I’ve been noticing a discharge from her lady parts, like a milky slightly yellowish liquid. 

I will take her to the vet on the 2nd of January, when they reopen. But is there anything I can do now? I tried googling the issue but it doesn’t seem like a common problem. "
184,[help] Extreme shedding all of a sudden,dogs,t3_a9x67e,3,False,False,a9x67e,"3 months ago we rescued a pit bull/Bassett hound mix who is approximately 2 years old. We have been feeding him Merrick food since day one and he has shed very little. 

With the last bag of Merrick food we purchased, we noticed the kibbles were larger which was odd. I emailed Merrick about it and they advised that the food can vary because it is all natural. My dog has never puked, but he has puked twice since starting this bag. My main concern is out of nowhere he has been shedding a TON. If you pet him, you end up with a hand full of hair. He has no bald spots but is shedding a ton. I returned the bag and switched to Acana food. 

My fiancé gave him a bath today, the hair covered the tub and clogged the drain it was so bad. We are worried sick about our boy. 

The only other change in our home was a real Christmas tree, but he hasn’t gone really close to it or eaten any pines needles. We live in Illinois so the climate is cold when he goes outside, but from what I’m reading dogs don’t really shed their coats this time of year. 

He is still 100% himself and active and doesn’t seem sick at all. Loves his food and is playful. Should we just give it a few days to see if it was the food? Get him to a vet immediately? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you in advance.

With it being the holidays my family sees her a lot and they nonstop feed her “human food” She is the only dog in the family but all 20 of them go overboard. I have to bring her with because i travel 1-3 hours just to see the family so i don’t wanna leave her alone all day. i’m tempted to just stop visiting them if i don’t have someone to watch her.

186,[Help] 8 month old puppy isn’t confident and heavily relies on everything we do.,dogs,t3_a9orpv,21,False,False,a9orpv,"So the title may have been a little misleading, but I didn’t really understand how to word my issue. Basically, we got a puppy in June and we have had him since we was 5ish weeks old. He’s a small breed, and we tend to think that we’re pretty good puppy owners. Leo is usually around other humans for roughly 20% of the day considering we put him up when we leave the house. 

Now comes the frustrating part. We could leave Leo for 12+ hours (obvi we wouldn’t do that) and he wouldn’t whimper once. But, the second the door closes to the bathroom he’s screaming his head off. Similarly, we recently moved Leo to the back seat for car rides and needless to say he hates it. Not to mention he’s still very bitty and requires constant attention.

We love him very much and would never get rid of him, but we need some suggestions on how to:
    1. Stop the biting (or will is stop over time) ? 
    2. Allow Leo to understand that it will be ok if we don’t see each other for 5 seconds, or if he’s not in our arms in the front seat. 

I understand we may not have made some of the best decisions in the beginning of training, but we did the best we could. 

Edit: so funny story as to why we got him at 5 weeks. We needed something hypo allergenic and we searched for a rescue for awhile and then came across Leo on Craigslist for a small fee. They told us he was 8-9 weeks old which we fell for and mostly just fell in love. When we took him to the vet the vet immediately knew he wasn’t 8. "
187,[HELP] My small 6 lb. Chihuahua tore his Cranial Cruciate Ligament,dogs,t3_a9trqv,3,False,False,a9trqv,"My dog tore his CCL a few days ago.

188,[Help] Our 15 year old has giardia,dogs,t3_a9unaz,11,False,False,a9unaz,"Sorry if I’m not doing this properly, I read the rules but I have never posted in this sub before. 

Anyway, our 15 year old mixed breed (Aussie shepherd/cattle dog/lab; usually about 50lbs) started having diarrhea about a week ago. After it didn’t subside for a couple of days, we took her to the vet and they did some tests and she was positive for the giardia parasite. She has been having explosive/watery diarrhea for about a week now. She is otherwise very healthy for a 15 year old. Declining a bit due to hip issues, but healthy for her age.

She’s on metronidazole every 12 hours with a full meal (chicken and rice/bland diet) for 10 days, and liquid panacur once a day for 6 days. She’s been on the metronidazole for 5 days, and the panacur for 3 days. Her diarrhea is definitely still there. She’s having tons of diarrhea accidents at night and it’s starting to get more watery. 

Since she is a senior, this has definitely knocked her down. She’s weaker and usually INSANE about food but isn’t very interested in her chicken and rice. She was the first couple days but now only eats most of the chicken. I tried putting broth in it and it didn’t make a difference. I know side effects of both meds can cause loss of appetite but I’m worried because of her age and her love of food. She is down about 4 lbs from her normal weight. She’s still interested when we eat human food and interested in our other dogs food though. Oh and she’s drinking plenty of water/urinating regularly, which is good to see. 

So basically my questions are- has anyone had a senior dog with this parasite? Most people I have talked to had this in dogs under 1 year old. How long did it take for the diarrhea to go away and did they fully recover?

Also, is there something we can feed her besides rice for a bland diet? She likes chicken but I feel like she isn’t getting enough calories. 

Sorry this was so long! I would love any feedback.

189,[Help] Dog humping all the time,dogs,t3_a9uhde,0,False,False,a9uhde,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have an 8 year old female scottie mix who is spayed.  She is humping ALL THE TIME.  We adopted a new dog several months ago - a male catahoula mix - who she seems to genuinely like.  She will climb into his crate with him and sleep, they each sleep on the same bed most nights, and they spend a lot of time together outside.  She's older and doesn't like to fetch and while he'd love her to play with him more rough, she's older and that's not her style.  So, no signs of aggression, they share bones, no red flags.  


However, the blanket in her crib is CONSTANTLY being humped.  Like nonstop.  She's humping all day and night right now.  She has humped a couple of stuffed animals before but very rarely.  The humping started several weeks ago and seems to have reached a high right when we had holiday guests (that she knows very well and likes).  I don't know what to do but say ""stop"" but she will start up again, inevitably.  The humping doesn't seem to coincide with the other dog ""bothering"" her or invading her personal space and she is clearly the alpha in the house.  If he gets too involved or careless, she tells him to back off and he will roll over into a submissive pose.  He's still very much a puppy, you see, and sometimes gets rambunctious.  Still, that doesn't seem related.  She just had a vet checkup and nothing is amiss.  They say it is likely due to the new dog and it should subside but it only seems to have gotten worse.  


It's a really annoying behavior, TBH.  Is there a way to train her out of it.  I don't believe in punishing either one of them.  And, her being a terrier, she won't do anything she doesn't see in her best interest.  We do occasionally have to medicate her for OCD and anxiety so maybe that would help?  She's a very neurotic dog."

192,"[Help] Going to dog parks/swimming areas, and keeping doggy healthy.",dogs,t3_a9wkaq,5,False,False,a9wkaq,"Hey everyone.

So beyond ""make sure your dog's vaccinations are up to date"" I didn't think I'd have to take precautions regarding doggo's health at dog parks, but after I started taking her she started getting eye infections. Her eyes were red one after the other and weeping TERRIBLY.

So we figured it was the water she was drinking (she loves snorkelling) so I've been taking precautions with that.

But my question's not about the eye infections. That's just an example of how something I didn't see coming impacted our outings.

The question is, **what kind of other health-related precautions do I need to take when I take my dog out to the dog park**?

IE:

* Picking up after your dog to avoid spread of disease (duh)

* Vaccines (also duh)

* I've been taking her own bowl with us so that I know the water she's drinking is clean, since the bowls provided tend to get muddy, and even making sure to empty it out and refilling it wasn't enough.

* I've been flushing her eyes out with saline solution after she's gone swimming, because her favourite thing to do is snorkel. (IE, stick her head under the surface, walk around like that, lift head and shake all over innocent bystanders, rinse and repeat.)

I don't want to be paranoid, but I'm just wondering if there's ""common sense"" issues that I'm completely unaware of that I should take into account.

Our mother's also concerned that our dog will get ""parasites"" from swimming in the lagoon, but I asked her for info and her response was that she was concerned the doggo would get amoeba up her nose or something. I'm... not even sure we can get brain eating amoeba down here in Sydney but maybe there is a problem with waterborne pathogens and I need to take more precautions to keep my dog safe?

**TL;DR -- After taking doggo out to dog parks and swimming and having to flush her eyes/have her only drink from her own bowl to prevent infections, it's left me wondering what other precautions I should be taking that I'm not aware of to keep doggy healthy?**

Also, there's storm water drains nearby -- should I be letting doggo swim near that, or is it fine? It's definitely storm water, not sewage."

198,[Help] On Saturday I'll be taking away a neglected St. Bernard from my in-laws. How do we introduce him to our Maltese puppy safely?,dogs,t3_a9sazk,3,False,False,a9sazk,"On Saturday we'll take home a 4 year old St. Bernard from my wife's parents. He's spent the vast majority of his life locked up in a cage in their yard. He's been heavily neglected for the past almost 4 years, basically never played with, never groomed. His hair is under the neck and on legs is all tangled up and dirty. All they ever did was feed him. His water gets changed every couple days in the 20 liter bucket. You can imagine what that looks.

He hasn't received any kind of training. He likes us since we're the only ones who let him outside for a walk in the yard and play with him, but he's not very obedient of us, of course. I'd say he weighs around 65 kg (140 lbs). He's not been socialized with other dogs, and just introduced to a couple people.

Now I'm afraid how he'll react to our dog at home. The Maltese is 5 months old now. She's very curious, energetic, and fearless, which I fear could be to her detriment. I'm not sure how to approach introducing him to the puppy safely. He's not an aggressive dog, but I'm afraid he could get annoyed with her and bite her head off or something. So I'd like to avoid this. Them not ever seeing and meeting each other is not an option for me.

I also have some concerns about how he'll adapt to the new environment where he'll be free, and coming to another dog's territory, but that's a whole another issue. We're primarily concerned about the safety of the puppy, as I can see her being excited and jumpy around him. If not angry even. I'm not sure.

We'll also get the vet to come check him up immediately.

You see, she *always* eats her food. We've been training her to wait until we give her the go ahead so she doesn't just inhale it in two seconds. Either yesterday or the day before, though, she just kind of... stopped eating. She'll take a couple of bites of her breakfast in the morning and then leave it, then take maybe one bite around when she'd eat lunch, and then barely touch it during dinner time.

203,[Breed] What breed is right for my family?,dogs,t3_a9uhrs,6,False,False,a9uhrs,"COPY/PASTE THE FOLLOWING FOR AUTO-FORMAT WITH BULLETS

Copy/paste the text below into a new text post..

Replace ""ANSWER"" with your response but do not delete the asterisk (*). Leave a space between the asterisk and your response.

Remember to include [Breeds] in the title of your post.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I grew up with dogs. They were all outside dogs and we lived in the country. I am in an urban area and am looking to get an inside dog.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I am wary of rescue's. I have children (3 &amp; 5), and their safety is my #1 priority. I would prefer to have a dog that could grow up with them in the house to avoid safety issues.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I would like to have a dog that isn't large (we own our house, but it isn't a big house). Is cat friendly, is excellent with kids, and is NOT high energy. Medium to small size would be best, with an excellent temperament. Also, I would like to avoid the smell of a hound (the beagle smell).

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Something like a Pug, that isn't all messed up. I really don't know what other medium to small breeds fit the bill of not requiring too much exercise.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands, sit, stay, recall.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work full time, so it will need be crated while I am at work (about 8 hours straight). I could probably make something work out while it was in the puppy stages to cut that timeframe different for awhile until it had a large enough bladder.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30 minutes to an hour. In the summer this number will be much higher since I like to hike (I would avoid hiking with the dog if necessary due to issues with its breed or size). 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Looking for as low maintenance as possible. Not looking to pay a professional. Maybe once a month.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Small to medium.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I would prefer less shedding and slobber. Barking I can handle as long as it can be contained by training.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important. If the dog is outside it will be on a leash or a lead.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I want it to be nice.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I don't have any tolerance for this.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggressiveness is a no go. I'm pretty hardline on this.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 8-9 hours a day while I am at work (at most, it varies with my wife's schedule).

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Their desires are reflected in this. I have two small kids (3 &amp; 6). My primary concern is that the kids are safe.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a house cat.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No. I own my house.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Ohio. I live in an unincorporated township.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers can easily hit in the 90's, winters can get pretty cold as well (30's).

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I am looking for a kid friendly, low maintenance dog that physically fits in our house and doesn't require a lot of exercise, but is able to hike.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

204,[fluff] Our Christmas Eve stray.,dogs,t3_a9p758,31,False,False,a9p758,"I’ve never posted before in this sub but I’ve been following for some time, I thought this made for a pretty good post/holiday. 

My husband works in the oil fields in the Midwest US. Right now our temps are slightly above zero, freezing rain, terrible awful weather. 
He was working on Christmas Eve (having a shitty day, so was I) and when he went to a disposal there was a border collie roaming around. Super friendly, showed up a few days ago but no one at the disposal knew her and no farmers live nearby for miles. 
Meanwhile, her entire butt is severely matted, full of dried dead worms, (who apparently couldn’t make it out of the matting) she’s extremely bloated from the infestation, hungry, cold, and her pads are frostbit. She was wearing what looked like a 20 year old collar with no tags and it’s not uncommon in this state to dump dogs before leaving for home (out of state), or cowboys that don’t give a 💩 about dogs (chained up outside in sub zero temps)

Husband realllllly tried to not add a second dog to our family.
But he brought her home. We had to shave the matting out (she couldn’t actually go to the bathroom because the matting was so thick). We’ve fed her teeny meals throughout the day so it didnt’t shock her system, she actually managed to poop (hurray!) and she’s getting along pretty well with our resident (also adopted) male dog. They’ve had some vocalizations but nothing violent. Thank god. 
She’ll be going to the vet soon (within a week) to get looked at and get her shots.  She’s having a little hard time breathing, and she’s pretty lethargic and tired, but she really wants to be spunky and puppyish. We suspect maybe lungworms or an upper respiratory infection from eating roadkill/weather, so fingers crossed for minor health problems instead of anything severe!
And before anyone says it, yes, all precautions were taken, our dog is up to date on all vaccinations and he’ll be receiving a round of wormer with her, they use separate areas of the yard and have their own space (just to clear that up). My husband has vet experience and grew up in a vet family so, we’re definitely alright. 

It’s funny to say, We were thinking about adding a second dog to our family for a while but decided to keep the space open because we seem to always stumble upon the dogs that really need help. I’m so glad we waited. 

Her name is Eve. 
Yes, I was going to default to Santa’s Little Helper if no one decided a name. 
If anyone has any tips for maintaining a peaceful environment between a resident and new dog, that would be great! Maybe ways to help them bond a little better? Or stories of how your dogs bonded, how long it took, do they just tolerate each other or actually care etc. This will be my first time having two dogs (not my husband’s), so I’d love to hear your experiences. 
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

205,[HELP] Hello Pupper People! I'm hoping to get some suggestions and insight on what I need to do to make a doggo decision!,dogs,t3_a9udxd,11,False,False,a9udxd," I  am a disabled man.  My physical conditions are tied to severe nerve  pain that's uncontrolled much of the time.  I sorted spend most of my  time home alone and really need a reliable pup pal to help keep me  company, but I'm going to have to be pretty specific about what things I  need and can tolerate and it's going to be difficult. You are all  smarter and more experienced than I am, especially considering I've  never owned a dog before.

This is what  I'm really going to have to consider before I move on with my thoughts.   I need to clear with my housing authority first, but the pet policy is  pretty open.

I will need to be looking at:

A medium (not small, please) sized dog with a low shed potential

A cuddle pup, one that won't mind climbing up with me on the bed and hanging out

Low  activity as far as room to run out high energy.  I am in a quiet,  somewhat rural neighborhood, but I can't have a high energy dog that had  to run, especially because I'm on a hill.  I have a park at the base of  my high energy that will be acceptable for walking.

I  know age is going to be a big thing when it comes to a tempered dog,  like no new pups for example.  I'm thinking 4-5 years, though I'll not  sure if it's a good goal or not.  I just don't want one that will pass  within a couple of years.

What breeds do you suggest?  What I do I need to learn first?  Male or female are both acceptable!

Thank you!!"
206,[Fluff] Skittish Rescue Remembers Home,dogs,t3_a9kl38,9,False,False,a9kl38,"I adopted a skittish rescue last winter, about 2-3 years old. He is very calm and gentle, hardly ever bark. I tried not to give him anything free; he is always asked to sit or do something for his meals and treats as I read that it is a good way to boost dogs confidence. But he still gets very scared so easily that he pees uncontrollably if we bump each other at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we went for a long walk all the way into the woods at the end of my apartment complex. I often have him off leash as he listens to me. Even if he runs off to chase a squirrel, he doesn't go far and comes back. It was different today; he chased something (for some reason, yelping while chasing), and I didn't realize the fence wasn't complete. He ran off and disappeared. I called his name and tried to find him in the woods for a while, to no avail. I realized I wouldn't be able to find him and walked back home. He wasn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought someone eventually would call me since he has a collar with my number, and he's microchipped. About 30 minutes later, I heard a bark (I don't recognize his bark as I only heard him barking a few times for the entire year). I thought it would be another dog somewhere, but opened the front door just in case. There he was sitting in front of the door. What a good boy. I always wondered if he is happy with me as I'm a first time dog owner. I guess he at least thinks this is his home to come back to."

209,[Breeds] What Type of Dog Would You Recommend for Me?,dogs,t3_a9u29m,10,False,False,a9u29m,"\*\*So I am finally paying off my student loans this week, and told myself I would not buy a dog until I paid them off. Now I am starting my search for my first ever dog (did not have one growing up) and could not be more excited! If you all could offer any help regarding the breed I should get or general advise, I would greatly appreciate it.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Growing up my family had a farm dog and some farm cats, but that was when I was in elementary school. I have not had any pets since then, though I begged and begged my parents for a dog with no luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I do not have a preference; however, if going through a breeder for a specific type of dog will reduce the risk of my dog having health issues, then I have no problem going that route.

&amp;#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* I want a dog who is fun and active and can hangout with me in the Texas heat outdoors, but when it comes time to relax at night, I want my dog chilling out with me. I'm a bit of an old man and don't do anything but relax past 9 PM during the week and go to bed around 11.

&amp;#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* On an average weekday, I would be able to take my dog on an hour long walk/run. I have dog parks in the area and my apartment complex will be finishing their dog park this coming spring, so those are an option as well. On the weekends I could spend  lot more time giving my dog exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Not that important.

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would prefer a dog that is neutral, but if I had to pick one I would want a snugly dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would like a dog that is eager-to-please.

&amp;#x200B;

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would like my dog to not bark, and be cool with visitors and strangers as I have family and friends over frequently.

\* On an average week, I work 8-5 but can come home during lunch for 30 minutes. After work, I come home and then go to the gym from around 6:30 to 8:30. I am then at home the rest of the night and usually go to sleep at around 11. However, I do travel monday through thursday every once in a while and my family has agreed to watch my dog for those weeks I do travel. Either it be my sister, grandma, or parents.

210,[Breed] What dog breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_a9u23k,4,False,False,a9u23k,"Introduction

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my boyfriend and I's first dog as independent adults. We both grew up with dogs and I have been the primary care-taker/carer of our dogs since I was 12 (this includes an old special needs dog, and then a boxer and husky puppy which I raised, both of which turned out lovely and well behaved). 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I would prefer to rescue a dog, though my boyfriend has never had a puppy and wants to have one at least once so I agreed that if we can't find a puppy that fits our lifestyle in a rescue within ~6 months then we can begin looking for a reputable breeder. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.

While I personally don't mind energetic or vocal dogs (I love my husky more than anything) we will be in a one or two bedroom apartment with overall very limited space. So I would need a dog that is quiet and has at least controlled energy similar to a greyhound. I enjoy outdoor activities so it will be exercised but I don't want it to tear up my apartment if I miss a day. I also prefer dogs that are smart and think for themselves. Ex. In the case of my husky and boxer, the husky is very intelligent and quickly learned many tricks, but only performs them if he recognizes a mutual benefit. Whereas the boxer is very difficult to train but eager to please. She understands all of two commands but performs them with so much enthusiasm lol. I find it more endearing that my husky is so independent and headstrong but actively chooses to obey and be affectionate with me, whereas my boxer is just happy and obedient with everyone and no matter what so it takes away from the depth of the connection for me for some reason.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I prefer mutts, and otherwise the dogs I like are not well suited to apartments so I'm not entirely sure about this one.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I'd like for my dog to know basic commands at the very least, but I find that even the slowest of dogs (my boxer lol) are capable of learning basic commands so I'm not too worried about this. If they can be trained further that would be fun but I know that typically tends to pertain to higher energy breeds.

Care Commitments

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I am stuck at the hip to my dogs, so most of my time at home is spent with them. Focused one on one training I could do at least a couple hours a day until they're older, which would taper off to one hour.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

My boyfriend and I both enjoy going on walks so they'll probably get at least one long walk a day, maybe two. There are no dog parks in his area but local general recreational parks will be visited frequently where there are other people and dogs to interact with. Would occasionally visit trails but they're far off from our city apartment so not a regular thing.

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

More than happy to do any grooming tasks, I work at a vet clinic and am capable of doing most basic things but for any advanced/styled hair cuts (ie. Poodles, etc) I wouldn't mind visiting a professional groomer.

Personal Preferences

9) What size dog are you looking for?

I tend to prefer larger dogs but I'm not picky. I'm inclined to say a medium size breed would be better as I wouldn't want a large dog to be uncomfortable in cramped quarters.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I don't mind shedding at all, the boyfriend isn't a huge fan but it's not a deal breaker for him. Would prefer less slobbering but again not a deal breaker. Cannot be very vocal though unfortunately, I will miss my Husky's singing voice for sure!

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It's not very important to me as there are limited scenarios wherein my dog would be allowed off leash, but if they can be trained to do so it's definitely not a bad thing.

Dog Personality and Behavior

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly to the max lol

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I'd prefer one that does it's own thing but still enjoys my company. 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

An unreactive dog would be better, as it cannot be very loud, and while I am ok with putting in the extra work to socialize particularly anti-social breeds, it would be nice if they were at least indifferent or receptive to meeting strangers and visitors. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Yes

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I would like to avoid loud/vocal breeds.

Lifestyle

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Each week-day they would be left alone for ~6-8 hours depending on my classes and work schedule, but my boyfriend has finished school so he works 6am-4pm so he's consistently home in the evenings regardless. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Boyfriend is on the same page for the most part, no major disputes. He will help in taking care of the dog when I'm not home but I will be the primary care-taker.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We would like to have a cat or two and possibly other various small pets later on.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Boyfriend has a 4 y.o. niece who will visit occasionally.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No known restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Metz, France. In the past pitbull and mastiff type breeds have been banned, and supposedly still are, though they're common in the area so I'm not 100% sure on the situation and there's no info online, but to be safe will avoid these breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Moderately cold winters, 20-30F and little snow. Very warm summers 70-80F.

Additional Information and Questions

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Any mix of breeds is ok as well. I'm not too heart-set on any specific breed as I know each dog is an individual and tends to conform to their home lifestyle when brought home at a young age, but still would like to have a feel/expectation for the breed as a whole.

211,[Help] Does this look like Syringomyelia?,dogs,t3_a9uy1f,2,False,False,a9uy1f,"Just took my dog for a walk and my little guy is doing what appears to be a classic sign of syringomelia. He also definitely shows sensitivity around his neck and head and yelps if someone touches him there sometimes...He is 1.5 years old and I got him from a reputable breeder intentionally to mitigate the risks of him getting this condition (his dad is a champion show dog and comes from a good line of dogs).

Obviously bringing him to the vet but since it's late at night was just curious to hear all of your thoughts... video at the link

212,[Fluff] Some Christmas drama courtesy of our pup,dogs,t3_a9h1yf,76,False,False,a9h1yf,"Our 1.5 year old chocolate lab snuck up to the closet where we were hiding the Christmas gifts last night around 11pm. He found a pound of chocolate-covered raisins and ate them... all of them. We had a holy-shit moment as we collectively realized... Chocolate: bad. Raisins: worse! 

Thankfully, we discovered what he'd done relatively quickly. I called our vet's emergency number and the sweetest woman on planet Earth talked me through getting my dog to ingest some hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting, which worked right away. We've been keeping an eye on him, and it's now more than half a day later with no apparent illness, so I think we dodged a bullet.

This dog, man. He's a handful and a half but I just can't stay mad at him, especially on Christmas."
213,[Help] 10 year old dog - Collapsed trachea &amp; enlarged heart advice,dogs,t3_a9opmr,11,False,False,a9opmr,"I'm looking for any advice for my current situation. Our 10 year old family dog, Ozzy (Cairn Terrier Jack Russell Mix), has been dealing with a collapsed trachea and enlarged heart for a little over a year now. That's roughly when the coughing started.

I've watched it slowly progress into something that truly breaks my heart to see/hear. We've taken him to the vet many times, and have been given codeine + a water pill, since apparently he had excess fluid build up. He has moments where he is quiet, but even then, I notice this constant heavy breathing, almost like he is struggling. When he gets into a coughing fit, it has evolved from the standard ""goose"" sounding honk that comes from the cough, to more a sound that I can only describe as similar to when a human has a really ""airy"" and long laugh that comes more from them exhaling a ton/pushing air out. These can last for 5-10 minutes, and he will either pace around, or lay down with belly facing the ground, front paws out ahead, and resting his chin on them. He's recently got into sneezing fits during these episodes as well. 

The medicine we were given, I imagine, stops these episodes from happening more frequently, but any time he gets excited (which is a lot), they start up. We also have a 3 year old Black Lab/Shepard Mix, who is very gentle with Ozzy, but in recent times hasn't been able to play with him because of these episodes. It's difficult because some nights he'll sleep through the night, and other times he'll have us all up with that cough and breathing issues. The water pill also has him going out more, as expected, but he's recently started to have some accidents on the cough, which I'm presuming happen while he's coughing. 

His appetite is still pretty good during all of this, and you can tell his still has energy when we let him out, because he'll run as fast as he can (even though he'll start coughing during this). I guess I just don't know what to do. It really seems to me as if he is suffering more than he is ""calm"". Surgery for him is out of the question, especially for his age. I don't know whether I need to start thinking about having him put down, or do I try to get a second opinion somewhere else? 

I love this dog so much, but I hate seeing him suffer and just want to make sure I'm making the right decision.

Any advice/suggestions from you guys would mean a lot. Thanks!

She’s 10 months old now &amp; her temperament is stubborn, lazy, and loving. Very sweet and interested in smelling everything. She’s almost 60lbs. Makes a clicking nose when outside smelling the ground. Everyone is her new best friend.

We got a puppy pug. He's now 6 months. So often during the day, the older pug will find one of the puppy's toys and pee on it. Which prompts him to think it's time to pee and will pee right next to it.

This will happen even if they've been outside just half an hour before. When they're outside, when one pees, the other will likely pee right on top of that spot. This can go back and forth sometimes up to three times.

How do I stop this behavioral problem in both animals? The older dog showing that it's okay to pee indoors is not acceptable behavior and is teaching the pup very bad habits."

But of you cuddle one of them, he “purrs” and it is LOUD. Our other dog does it too but not as often or as loud. At first I thought maybe we were hurting him somehow by cuddling and he was trying to tell us? But nope. Asked the vet at our annual visit and they said it’s pretty common.

While I know what breed I think would suit me best I'm not 100% sure. Help me choose what breed my future furry friend should be! **

    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * I've owned a dog before as a family pet, (male Corgi cross we got as a rescue when he was 10) so I have no experience with training. This would be my first dog of my own.

    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    * Would prefer to rescue if I can find the right dog for me but am open to both options.

    3)Describe your ideal dog.

    * One that loves people and playing but is also chilled. Easy to train and obedient. Would prefer a medium-large sized dog. I want a dog which will be a great companion above all else.

    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * Golden or Labrador Retriever as I think these fit the preferences listed in Q3 but I'm open to suggestions.

    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * Basic manners is a must. Would like to train it to be comfortable in a crate/dog cage as a place where it's bed will be most of the time. Fetching and returning a ball. Other basic stuff like being well behaved around strangers and other dogs.

    **Care Commitments**

      6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * As long as I need to for the stuff listed above. I would probably want to devote a lot of free time outside of training to playing and generally being with my dog.

    7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * 2-4 hours. Live outside of a city so main exercise would probably be walks/hikes and throwing a ball for it to retrieve.

    8)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * If possible I'd be willing to groom it myself every day and if not then I'd be willing to pay a professional but would prefer a lower maintenance dog which wouldn't need regular hair trimming.

    **Personal Preferences**

    9)What size dog are you looking for?

    * Medium or large

    10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * Would prefer less slobber and barking but not too bothered about shedding.

    11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * Important but not absolutely essential.

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * Both would be fine but snuggly would be better

Will the sex of the dog make a difference to its personality, if so, would you recommend male or female for my preferences?

I also understand that golden retrievers can be prone to some conditions such as skin conditions, is there another breed which is similar in temperament and personality which aren't prone to health issues?

Is there anything else I should know about or consider when it comes to what breed or age of dog?

Thanks!

 1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

No.

 1. Describe your ideal dog.

A big affectionate dog that's up for a long hike but able to relax and nap when we're done. My only complain with the current dog (Aussie Shepherd) is he doesn't EVER turn off. I'll run him 6 miles hard and he still wants non stop playtime all day. It can get a little frustrating. 

 1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Wife is interested in Golden and Labs, I like greater Swiss, Bernese mountain dog, saint Bernard, Irish wolfhound. Again, we'd like bigger, a little calmer, and affectionate.

He gave her to his friend's sister. After not seeing her for nearly two years, he got to see her this week and she wouldn't leave his side.

222,[help] any kennel cough home remedies?,dogs,t3_a9vxx3,1,False,False,a9vxx3,"Hello all,

I’m here to talk about my little guy Benny. The fiancé and I adopted him last Sunday. Sunday he was fine, Monday he was fine, Tuesday he was perfect. Before we went to bed Tuesday night, he coughed out a little bit of flem. We made nothing of it, and got some sleep. Wednesday we woke up, and he had been throwing up white foamy “flem” and it persisted all morning, afternoon, and evening. We have an appointment for him tomorrow. The assumption is that he has kennel cough. He was vaccinated for it early December. When we called the adoption center, they called us over to go pick up antibiotics, which he later threw up. Now we have an appointment tomorrow morning, but we are are obviously very concerned. Is there something we can give him just to get us, and most importantly him through these next 10+ hours? 
We are camping out with our little buddy in the living room tonight. Will probably be up most of the night. 

So far the only thing he has been able to hold down is some chicken. He held it for about 45 minutes. Any times he drinks, or eats his kibbles, he throws up. He’s been throwing up randomly. Now he’s just laying in his little bed next to us. 

We were told not to take him to urgent care considering because they didn’t deem it to be serious enough.

223,[help] my old man,dogs,t3_a9vsot,3,False,False,a9vsot,"I've had my old friend for almost 11 years- ever since I adopted him at 8 weeks at an animal shelter I worked at. He's been a great companion for most of my adult life. 

But just within the past couple of years, there's been a decline in his overall health and personality. He stopped eating for awhile and I started using wet dog food to help entice him to eat his dry. (He's now on a grain free dry mix that he eats with interest) 

He started getting a bad rash during the summer so I thought it was seasonal allergies, but it stuck around. I'm giving him weekly baths with 3 different shampoos to help with his itch (which they do greatly!) Where he chewed most of the hair off on his hind end, it is growing back in. 

He started going to the bathroom in my daughter's room and just recently would pee on the Christmas tree, all while we are home and able to let him out. He basically stopped telling us he needs to go outside. So he has to be in an office when we aren't home. And 10/10 he uses the bathroom in the office which has been a big stress at home. The other night, we were home all day and he was let out many times, but he still went in my daughter's room to poop while we were in another room.

He acts like he can't hear us at all. Walking up to him and brushing past him makes him jump. And he basically ignores us or looks at me blankly when I groom him or pet him. He use to show an expression of love or Joy whenever I sit next to him now it's kind of blank or sad.

It has been stressful the past year or so and we are on a tight budget currently so I can't take my 65+lb dog to the vet and afford the check up.

I guess what I am asking for is advice. Someone asked me if it's time to put him down. But I felt like it was only necessary if he was in pain. I'm not sure if he's in pain. He just isn't the same dog anymore and it's sad with him seeming so depressed and disconnected.

229,[Help] Is my diffuser making my dog sick?,dogs,t3_a9rf5x,2,False,False,a9rf5x,"Hi all. I'm new to this community and I am on mobile fyi.

I got a nice diffuser for Christmas and I'm in love with it! Problem is that I just read that it may be harmful to dogs, I'm seeing conflicting articles online about it. I don't know if it is just from injestion from the oils or the smells that cause them harm (or none).

Now background: My dog puked three times today and yesterday (total not each day). Once in my basement, once in the car, and once in the kitchen. I assume the car and kitchen one was from the car ride, because she gets carsick.  As for the time in the basement: that is not where I keep the diffuser. She has always been a puker because she eats grass and socks (we are trying to get her not to eat them and take them away when we see her have them).

Anyway, I assume they are unrelated to the diffuser, but I need to know because I am an extrenely paranoid person and obviously don't want to hurt my dog. If it is the diffuser, should get rid of it or at least not keep it on near my dog? Thank you.

230,[Help] 4yo dog tore her ACL,dogs,t3_a9p2ir,13,False,False,a9p2ir," My 4.5-year-old doggo has torn her ACL, and my heart is broken for her. She has had a minor limp for awhile that comes and goes and the vet suspected arthritis. Now a few days ago, the limp suddenly got so bad and she refuses to bear weight on it. I brought her in again and after xrays, the vet suspects a torn ACL, as well as arthritis. 

The vet told me I have two options - $4K surgery or strict rest and anti-inflammatories for life. She and I are both very active, and since she’s so young, I feel like the surgery is non-optional. She’s everything to me and it feels so awful to watch her have to lay around all day with no exercise. However, I’m fresh out of grad school, and $4K is going to be such a tough amount of money to come up with. 

Looking for any advice, similar experiences, words of wisdom, words of encouragement anyone might have.

We live in the Twin Cities in Minnesota. I’m wondering if there are any less expensive options out there - maybe surgery through the University? Is that a thing? We’re also struggling with stairs during this rest time - she’s not supposed to be climbing up stairs or jumping on furniture, but she weighs 50 lbs and it’s tough for me to carry her up 3 flights.

233,[Breeds] Is a Silken Windhound or a Windsprite right for me?,dogs,t3_a9plbi,1,False,False,a9plbi,"Formatting is off, sorry!

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first, I have two herding breeds that I got when I was in my mid-20's - I adopted an adult from a show-line breeder and purchased one as a puppy from a working-line breeder.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I'm certain that I'll only be able to get either a Silken Windhound or Windsprite from a breeder, so I'll go that route. I'm okay with either an adult needing to be rehomed or a puppy.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* What I'm looking for in this particular dog is a nice house pet that's ready to play/train/work when asked, but also okay with relaxing when asked. We have a fairly laid-back lifestyle so I'm looking for a dog that will be okay with that. My two current dogs are extremely willing-to-please herders, but that level of biddability is not something I'm necessarily looking for in my next dog. Trainability for basic manners is a must. It would also be really nice to have a dog we can bring to cafes and shops and such.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Silken Windhound or a Windsprite, but I'm not sure about the difference between the breeds. We've been involved with greyhound breed rescue in the past and enjoy sighthounds.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* This dog will primarily be a pet, although it would be nice to dabble in agility or coursing with it. I take agility classes with my current, younger dog, and I'm hoping to compete with her someday. We've actually had quite a few sighthounds in our agility classes, and it'd be nice to try it out with a Windhound or Windsprite, although I'm 100% aware that the training process will be vastly different with a sighthound than with my balls-to-the-wall herder. I take rally classes with my older dog, and we hope to compete someday, as well.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* To be honest, I wouldn't be *that* interested in training with this dog other than basic manners or CGC-type training, and possibly dabbling in agility. This dog would primarily be a companion animal. If it happens to take to agility, I would of course be ecstatic about that and pursue it, but I'm not expecting it to be a fantastic sports dog right out of the gate. 

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* 1 hour of walks or leashed hikes daily. There's a fenced park right next to our house that would be ideal for off-leash running if needed. My current dogs and I hike off-leash almost every day, and we put on a lot of miles during the weekend.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Yes to everything, would be willing to brush briefly daily.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-large. I've fostered greyhounds in the past and found them to be lovely dogs, but too large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle a moderate amount of shedding and barking, but I hate slobber.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* My current dogs are great off-leash, and I walk them off-leash in the woods every day. However, I'm not necessarily looking for that in my next dog and am 100% okay with them being leashed at all times.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine, but snuggly is better. I understand that sighthounds can be a bit aloof, and I'm okay with that.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either is fine.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* My preference is that they'd greet strangers and visitors with friendly curiosity rather than a boisterous, loud greeting. I'm okay with alert barking.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, especially because I have two current, resident dogs. My house is not set up for a crate-and-rotate situation, nor am I willing to manage that behavior.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Human or dog aggression/reactivity, resource guarding, escape artists. Prey drive *may* potentially be an issue (please see below).

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* We have regular, full-time work schedules, so potentially up to 10 hours a day. We already hire a dog walker to come mid-day for our current dogs. We also send our dogs to daycare 2 times a week.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My partner likes dogs and would help with 50% of caring for the dog, except for the sports-related and training activities - I'd be doing all of that.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* So this is the main problem I might be up against. I have two cats, which may pose a problem with prey driven sighthounds, but I'm hoping that raising a puppy or adopting a cat-friendly adult will help with that.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. We have relatives with small children (1-6 years of age). We'd supervise all interactions and would crate/separate when necessary.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope, we own our house.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in the United States. Sighthounds aren't banned here.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* We live in New England; summers here can range from 70-95 F and winters can range from -10-40F with snow and ice. We're willing to invest in clothing to keep a sighthound warm during the cold winter months.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* I'd like to know what the differences are between Silken Windhounds and Windsprites. My understanding is that Windsprites will be extremely close (if not identical) to Whippets in temperament, but my understanding of Windhound temperament is a bit unclear. I've met a couple in the past and they've seemed very typically sighthound in personality. They were a bit aloof, loved to nap, and had gentle, mild temperaments. One of the Silken Windhounds I met was good off-leash, but I understand that this may be the exception rather than the rule."
234,[HELP] What should I pay attention to when choosing a purebred dog? (Concerning the dog's health!),dogs,t3_a9xzwr,14,False,False,a9xzwr,"Disclaimer: I don't condone inbreeding in ANY kind of dog and I think it's horrible how people will breed a dog so it can't breathe (all kinds of bullies and pugs), walk when it's slightly older (German shepherd), and other cruel issues that will hurt the dog in its life. I am however inexperienced and would like to learn from you guys how to best go about getting a puppy that won't suffer in life because of asshole breeders.

&amp;#x200B;

Facts:

I would like to have a medium sized dog close in appearance/character to a border collie. I just love how they look, how smart they are, and how active they are. I intend to get such a dog mostly because it will be an incentive for me to exercise, and I'd love teaching him or her new tricks and keep him/her busy.

It does not HAVE TO BE a purebred dog and in fact I would PREFER a non pure-breed but with a LOT OF BORDER COLLIE in it so it retains characteristics (size, cuteness level, etc, most of this is personal preference, some of it, such as size, is practicality).

As this point I am NOT really considering adopting a shelter dog as my family has had trouble (real, real trouble) with them in the past, and I simply have (learned) too much respect of dogs' teeth to be comfortable with a dog I haven't raised myself. (Feel free to change my mind.)

&amp;#x200B;

All right. I've long thought about getting a dog and will probably think a while longer until I'm sure I want to be THIS responsible (I have a track record of being irresponsible that I'm trying to change). A discussion with my partner last night made me think and research more closely into health-issues purebred dogs can have.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two questions in particular:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) If we get a purebreed dog, what should we look out for? My partner says it's a matter of looking at a family tree and seeing if at some point in the dog's ancestry (although no further back than say great-grandparents) the dog's line was mixed with some other breed, which would minimize the chance of dog suffering from some sort of inbreeding condition. Is it that simple?

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Is it possible to find a breeder who will deliberately mix in a different breed every once in a while to ensure the dogs are as healthy genetically as they can be?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else we should consider before getting a dog? The actual acquisition of the dog might still be some time off, but I'd like to know as much as possible beforehand to prepare for it."
235,[Help] Adult foster dog exhibiting aggression towards strangers,dogs,t3_a9tykx,1,False,False,a9tykx,"I’ll try to make this on the shorter side so I get more people to read it and hopefully a lot of advice (ask me questions if I should clarify). I’m fostering a 2 year old Boston terrier that hates everyone except for a few people (she is very sweet and loving with me, my boyfriend, and a few other select women) and I’m trying to curb this behavior. It’s not just that she’s scared or dislikes other people- she can be downright aggressive. Lunging, growling, barking. I don’t know if she’d actually bite someone and I obviously haven’t tested it. She does it no matter where we are (though I’ve been trying to not take her in public until I know how to handle this), though she’s specifically much worse with men and she’s MUCH worse at home than anywhere else. 

This is something I knew I would have to deal with (she was like this at the shelter too, I actually was only able to take her on because I work there and she really took to me while I was working with her. They would not adopt her to anyone or allow the general public to foster her), but now that I have her I’m not sure how to handle it because I’m so afraid of her biting someone (shelter policy is that if she bites and it breaks skin/needs any medical attention, she’ll be put down basically. It’s harsh) that I don’t even know how to begin working with this. I have some very understanding friends that are willing to help me, as well as the entire shelter staff, but I’m not sure what the best way to go about this is so that I don’t make the behavior worse. I don’t want to make anything worse by trying to help. It’s worth noting she’s extemely protective over me.

237,[Help] Is there any way to get a 15-year-old dog to stop begging for food?,dogs,t3_a9ttes,4,False,False,a9ttes,"My family got an 11-year-old Australian shepherd/cocker spaniel mix named Sarah five years ago, and she’s always loved to eat, which is probably because she wasn’t always treated well before we got her. I’m in college, so I’m not around her all the time, but her begging has gotten gradually worse, and it really gets on my nerves. She’s always getting in our way in the kitchen and whining when we’re eating. It was especially bad yesterday when we had family over for Christmas.

238,[Help] My dog won’t stop barking when we leave.,dogs,t3_a9tavf,10,False,False,a9tavf,"My dog is perfectly behaved when we’re home, but when we leave she gets whiny and starts barking. We don’t know how long she’s necessarily barking, but we have come home after work to find her barking, and we have also waited outside to find out if she’s going to bark, and she did. 

We have tried Thunder shirts, covering the kennel, feeding her in the kennel, giving her a Kong with frozen peanut butter and food, interval training, leaving the TV on, playing music... I’m probably forgetting a couple. 

I’m convinced we need to try the shock collar. The wife is terrified of them and refuses. But she’s also terrified that we’ll get evicted from our apartment if she keeps this up. 

Should we try the shock collar next, or are there more things to try?"
239,[Help] An Aggressive Golden.,dogs,t3_a9ne6b,29,False,False,a9ne6b,"Sorry on mobile. 

Hello, I’m looking to see if other people have had similar experiences and if there’s any tips or strategies anyone could offer. So my sister has a 1 year old Golden Retriever and he can be quite aggressive. When he was a few months old he started to resource guard, take his toys into his crate and growl if you went near him when eating. He’d also pounce on you if you went into his crate to clean. 

As he’s gotten older he’s started to become aggressive in that you could be petting him and he’s enjoying it then he’d turn so quickly and snap at you. He’s caught my sister a few times and he bit a close family friend who the dog has known since he was a puppy, it was so bad she had to get a tetanus shot. 

He’s snapped at my oldest niece for petting him and my sister doesn’t let her toddler anywhere near him without his muzzle on as she’s scared that he may snap at her. 

The resource guarding has gotten better, as in you can be near him when he eats just no touching. He also does lunge for anything thats not his and does usually give it up with no treat. It’s more the petting issue. He does warn you when he’s had enough as he will lower his head and there’s a twitch in his upper lip that if you don’t stop he’s going to attack. 

It’s certainly not what I would say is normal for the breed and he’s not suffered anything traumatic since my sister bought him from the breeder though I cannot for sure say nothing happened to him when he was with his litter. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this or are there any tips anyone could suggest? 

Edit: Just an edit I’ve mentioned in a reply but I should set the record straight. Regarding the muzzling this was a misunderstanding by myself. He wares a halter to help with lead training which doesn’t cover the full mouth it’s a band over the mouth to help control him when he’s out as he’s quite strong and used to pull when he was younger. He’s actually really good outside and there’s never been a problem with aggression or anything of the sort when he’s out walking. "
240,[HELP] How much do Pomeranians shed around the house?,dogs,t3_a9szel,11,False,False,a9szel,"I finally got permission to get a dog but preferably one that doesn't shed much. From my research I understand this breed sheds a lot, however it can be controlled by brushing, baths, diet, etc. This is a breed I'm very interested in and am really trying to find a way to calm my parent's worry about the shedding.

I plan to buy a Roomba to deal with lose fur on the floor and am willing to brush the dog daily for 15-30 min. Of course I'll also give the pom baths as often as the vet recommends and a diet recommended by a vet as well. Is that enough to deal with the shedding? A little dog hair getting everywhere isn't a huge issue but if it's balls of hair or covering all the furniture then it'll become one. I'm not too keen on brushing the dog AND vacuuming the furniture daily to keep my parents happy so if it comes to that this might not be the breed for me. "

**My dog**:

* I've had my dog Roman since he was 8 months old. He is a rescue, pitbull terrier mix (45 lb) and is 4 years old
* He was abused before and so is scared of a lot of things.
* He has bitten 1 of my brothers friends a couple years ago
* He lunges at other dogs and people he dosent know. Once he knows someone thought he is an awesome dog.
* very attached to me get nervous if I leave the house for 10 minutes but seems fine with my work schedule just not when I come back and try to leave again.

**The situation**

My girlfriend and I, who I lived with broke up and so now its just me and Roman. I moved to a new state because I just changed career paths. I have paid thousands for training and his hip surgery. I also pay a lot to have a dog walker come every day in the middle of the day to take him out and hang out with him for 30 minutes. I also cook his meals cause he loves it.

My family are not dog people so I constantly hear how a young professional shouldn't have a dog and I should give him up and so on. Ive been told to give him up and get a dog who is friendly and trained from a breeder.

**My Question**

What can I do? I cant have people over I cant take him to other people's places, no dog parks. How can I make him this happy dog I can take to a barbecue and let go without worrying? Im in the beginning of my career and I cant spend too much money but I am willing to commit time and effort.

Also any advice on how a single person can manage a social life when they live with a dog (also travel once in a while)? Would getting a second dog give him a buddy to hang out with while I'm at work or the gym?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am getting so frustrated and I just wanna hear from some dog lovers who understand that giving up my dog is not an option."

That wasn't good enough she pestered me for weeks to buy a dog and after weeks of bothering me like an idiot I told her yes.(first of many mistakes) She didn't just go to a shelter and adopt one like a normal person she goes and spends $3000 on a French bulldog(Yes, $3000 for a French bulldog in the middle of planning a wedding) She wanted surgery done so she shelled out another $8000 for her surgery and $2000 for boarding/training for the new puppy.  Yes within a month my wife drops 5 grand on a puppy.  She's excited and I'm annoyed haven't met the dog and already aggravated.  When I visit her in Virginia(I was living in Maryland) I finally saw him and he was a cute little thing but I noticed something(first red flag) she always kept him in the kitchen away from the house.  I'm not a dog person by any means but even I understand that you can't keep them in the crate away from everyone all day that's just cruel.  So I gave her some suggestions about how to be a better pet owner.  Then she asked me could I let him outside?  Nothing crazy about that but she never put him on a leash just allowed him unrestricted access to the yard because it was easier that way.  Then every time I visited her she asked me if I could walk, feed, and give her dog potty breaks and would get upset if I didn't. Quick story I don't dislike dogs but after my baby sister was mauled by a great Dane and needed stiches in her foot I've been cautious of them. It didn't help that I was chased by a stray Rottweiler for 6 blocks when I was younger so don't have warm memories of them. Finally we get married and after months of this I get fed up and confront her about it.  Why do you pawn him off on me when I'm around it seems like you don't want to fully take care of him.  She told me that I'm her husband and it's my job to help her take care of him.  If you don't help me with him this is going to cause issues in our marriage now suck it up and deal with it.  As much as I didn't like that answer like a fool I shut up and dealt with it.  I asked her to potty train and house break him before we move in together.  She tells me she will deal with it when the time comes.  Well fast forward to when we finally move in together and he pees on the floor within 24 hours of moving in.  I look at her and just shake my head and she gives me an uneasy I'm sorry.  Then after living with her for the past few months she's pawned 90% of the responsibilities on me. Now she hardly feed him, take him outside to relieve himself, bathe him, train him etc.  He's still not house broken and pretty much sits in a 8x6 pen all day.  I told my wife that I'm not helping her spend 2000 on training if she's unwilling to follow the instructions given to us by the trainers.  The breaking point for me was she got upset about having to take him outside to use the bathroom.

244,[Help]Considering Giving our Shiba away,dogs,t3_a9stdp,3,False,False,a9stdp,
245,[Breeds] Seeking a PTSD service dog,dogs,t3_a9sq1q,8,False,False,a9sq1q," 

I'm seeking a PTSD service dog for my partner, but the dog will be owner-trained (as is the norm in our state) and raised from puppyhood by us instead of being purchased from a service dog organization, so we're kind of ""on our own"" when it comes to figuring out a breed.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, my partner and I have both had many dogs growing up and as adults have successfully raised a Pembroke corgi, who is our pride and joy. We primarily have experience with herding breeds but from what I understand they are not necessarily good PTSD service dogs as they tend to be reactive themselves.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We are definitely going through a reputable breeder so we can properly expose the dog to all situations from a young age. There are no young shelter dogs where we live.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Laid-back, not reactive, not anxious, friendly, easygoing, doesn't require a huge amount of exercise, large to extra large, kind.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* We're thinking a golden retriever is our best bet, but are open to other breeds. My partner has a fondness for GSDs but we feel the exercise requirements are going to be an issue as well as the tendencies toward reactivity.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The dog will be a service dog for my partner with PTSD and will be expected to perform those duties, which will include cueing when my partner is going to have a panic attack, leading him out of the store if he has one, etc.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* We both work from home and already know that our corgi gets many hours of attention each day, so it would be the same with our second dog. He is quite spoiled. :)

1. How  long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of  exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that  include using a dog park?

* We don't want a dog that has high exercise requirements. Our corgi gets a 30 minute walk every day, plus about two hours of more intensive play and training in the backyard (flirt poles, tug of war, fetch, etc.). A dog that needs more exercise than that isn't going to work out for us. Which leads me to greyhounds as a possibility, but we have cats and I'm not sure I'm comfortable having a greyhound around cats (especially cats that are allowed in the backyard, where there's plenty of ""chasing room"").

1. How  much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming  hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you  be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Daily brushing is a norm here. I'm comfortable with grooming at home but don't want a dog that needs frequent professional grooming. Trims at home are one thing.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Large to extra large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Our corgi is very quiet so I'd prefer to not have a barker. Shedding is fine. Slobber is fine within reason.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* The dog should be reliable off-leash in case my partner's hands are shaking and he drops the leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please.

1. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or  entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or  visitors?

* Alerting is good, but not a liability if that makes sense.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, definitely not.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression or prey drive towards humans, dogs or cats. Reactivity.

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Honestly, almost never, because the dog will be with my partner 99% of the time when we go out.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* We are both dog lovers. I will be assisting with caring for the dog and training. We do not have kids, but will be adopting eventually.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, we have a corgi and two cats.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, eventually, once we adopt.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own a house, no restrictions.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* New England, USA. No restrictions.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers are 70-90F degrees, winters are around 20-30F degrees.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* No additional questions."

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I'd prefer a puppy from a reputable breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Friendly, Loyal, Intelligent, Not extremely high energy.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

At the moment I'm thinking of either a Golden or a Lab. They seem to fit what I'm looking for but I'm interested in finding out about more breeds.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

At least the basic stuff but I'd be interested in learning them other cool things as well.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I work from home so I'm pretty much always home. I can interact with the dog a lot.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I'm not the most active person on the planet but I can excercise the dog as much as I need to. Except for breeds like Huskies etc probably.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I can brush the dog every day if that's needed. Cleaning ears and stuff is probably something I'll have to get used to but I'll be fine.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

Preferably a large dog

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding isn't a problem. I'd prefer a dog that doesn't bark too much. It's fine when there's someone at the door or something, but not the whole day. Slobber is also something I'll get used to after a while.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not very important but I do have a big yard which the dog might like. It's unfenced tho and I have cats who are outside sometimes (The cats live in a seperate house on my property with my parents).

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I'm fine with either.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I'm leaning more towards eager-to-please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

The only people that come to my house are friends and family so I'd prefer a friendly greeting.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I live in the middle of nowhere so there's no other dogs here really but if I come across someone with a dog while I'm walking my dog, I'd rather not have a dog that's aggressive.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Nothing I can think of right now.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home so I'm almost always home, except when I go to the store etc. I do like traveling but I'd take my dog with me. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I live alone so no other people involved.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I have 4 cats who live in a seperate house on the property but they do go outside. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No, no children here.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

The Netherlands. I'm not aware of any banned breeds. I'll have to do some research.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: about 26 degrees celcius, with the max around 33 but that's rare. 
Winter: About 0 degrees celsius"

We have not been able to bring her for training because she just barks at strangers and won’t stop.

She is skittish around dogs tho and tries to run away when they approach. When I have new people come over she barks at them for maybe 10 minutes and then calms down but if the new person gets up and walks around the barking starts all over again.

I talked to my vet about this and was told my breed is high strung (that’s putting it lightly). So he prescribed Xanax and trazedone. It hasn’t really done anything as a maintenance medication. I want to taper the meds and get her off of them but in the meantime I’m looking for suggestions.

263,[Discussion] Paracord Dog Harnesses: Concerns with using paracord or these designs?,dogs,t3_a9qdwe,3,False,False,a9qdwe,"[](https://imgur.com/a/K4yY1mc)

I'm thinking of making some paracord dog harnesses for my dogs, as I find the harnesses (especially ones with the front loop) make my dogs pull less. We also don't like the idea of choke collars and the leash pulling solely on their neck. The ones pictured above seem like pretty good designs. I understand the first design isn't exactly a harness, but I like the design of pulling the head down, and looping below the legs and behind the shoulders.

However, I have heard some people say paracord can be too rough on a dogs skin/fur, while some say it's fine. Do you guys see any issues with these designs, or using paracord in general? I love saving money and making stuff on my own, but I also want to double check the opinions with fellow dog owners to bring to my attention of any flaws or concerns with making a paracord harness.

Thanks!"
264,[Help] Dog acting off,dogs,t3_a9qdck,7,False,False,a9qdck,"My dog is a 2 year old Great Pyrenees named Daisy. We noticed the change in her behavior last night. She walked into my room last night, but after a couple steps, she backed up really fast into the corner and would not move from a sitting position. Usually, she'll come in and lie down beside me. She wouldn't move for about 20 minutes. She would whine at me (I was laying in bed) and nervously shift. She only whines at the door if she needs to go outside, but she didn't need to.

My sister picked her up to take her down stairs, but she refused to go. Eventually my sister got her to go into her room and she slept there the entire night. My sister said she hardly moved the entire night. Daisy usually moves around a lot, and she doesn't like to stay in one place for long.

This morning she followed my sister downstairs, and I let her outside, but as soon as she stepped out the door she turned around real fast and came back inside. Daisy's breed is a herding dog, and they love being outside. At this point I thought maybe it was her shock collar bothering her, so I took it off and made her go back outside. She stayed out there for about 3 minutes and then whined to come in.

Now she won't move from her spot by the couch. I'm thinking maybe she's sick, but I'm not sure. I could really use some input.

Update: So I've ruled out stomach problems. I brought her some food and she got up to eat it. "

266,[Help] My Portuguese Water Dog...is a horrible swimmer?,dogs,t3_a9qbzr,7,False,False,a9qbzr,"Hi everyone,

I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog. He's a pretty normal dog with the typical PWD quirks. We spend a majority of the time around water (a large lake mostly) on boats, at the beach, etc. Which was a large reason for getting this particular breed. The one problem we have had is that Max can't really swim. He splashes a lot, doesn't move his back legs at all and ends up vertical in the water instead of horizontal. When I have gotten in the water to try to ""show"" him how to move his legs, he just goes limp and I have to carry him back to shallow water where he can stand. We have tried getting him in the water with other dogs, but it hasn't really helped. Has anyone had any success overcoming a problem like this? Or did I just adopt the Water Dog who can't swim? Appreciate the help.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: He doesn't seem to be afraid of water, he actually enjoys being in when he can touch and seems to forget that he is a horrible swimmer. So, it doesn't appear to be a confidence/fear issue."

269,[Help] Dog poops in one spot in my parent's house (doesn't live there) but doesn't have incontinence issues... We've tried all chemical/cleaning remedies and have resorted to covering it in plastic. Any suggestions to modify the behavior?,dogs,t3_a9qajv,3,False,False,a9qajv,"My dog (10 year old beagle) spends maybe 3-4 days a month at my parent's house, typically during the week since they are retired and it's the closest thing they have to a grandkid.  He loves them and they spoil him. He has constant interaction and access to the outside while he is there and never has an issue if he's just visiting for the day.

If my husband and I need to travel for a few days my parents will watch him during that time. That's when he strikes. There is one spot-always the same spot- that he poops in during these overnight visits. We've tried cleaning it, using chemical repellents, taking him on excessively long walks, etc. etc. but he still poops in that same damn spot!

My mom has taken to just putting plastic down there (he still poops on it). He never does this if my husband and I are there, he doesn't have incontinence issues at our home (where he can stay alone for up to 8 hours on weekdays) or even at my parent's house on single day visits. He never pees just poops and only on over night stays in their house and in that same damn spot. 

We don't think it's the ""new"" environment because it isn't new and we moved houses 2 years ago and he's never had an issue at our new house. They also sometimes take him to their second home a few hours away and he's never had an issue there either.

recently i have been noticing whenever he thinks i’m upset or will be upset he’ll just start pooping while making eye contact! 

sometimes i give him the “the freedom” command, that allows him to explore without having to follow me.  when he goes a bit too far, and i yell at him to come back,  he stops, looks back at me and starts to poop! or if we’re at a dog park, and he gets in a scuffle with another rascal, then i come yell at him, he will put his little ears down, bowing to me, i’ll tell him sit, give him a little time out before i release him again, and as soon as i do, he will go poop while staring into my eyes. 

sometimes we’re walking off leash he’ll recognize someone’s smell and he’ll dart down the sidewalk tail wagging so fast, before he stops realizing the person he smelled isn’t there or is a stranger, then just as i become close enough to see him and am about to yell at him, he will have quickly found a spot and be at the beginning of his poo dance, he does a little 360 spin into a hand stand, balancing all his weight on his front paws, angling his butthole to the highest altitude he can manage before squeezing out little turds.

Since I’ve been considering it for that long, I don’t think it’s just a whim. But I’m still not sure because I’ve always thoroughly consider weed myself a cat person. I grew up with dogs, but all of my adult life I’ve only had cats and I really only know how to take care of cats since my parents took care of the dogs growing up. I know I like being around cats and I’m happy to take care of cats. I like dogs but I’m not sure how much I’ll like taking care of a dog considering they’re more needy than cats in terms of both care and attention. I know getting a dog is a big responsibility and I’m not going to get one unless I’m 100% sure I’m going to keep it for the duration of it’s life. I’m prepared to put in the time to properly train it when it’s a puppy. I’m usually only away from home for 7-9 hours Monday-Friday for work and I do have a lunch break where I can come home to let it out to go to the bathroom if that’s too long to leave it without a bathroom break. If I travel, I take all my pets with me rather than hire a pet sitter or board them at a kennel. Right now it’s just me and two cats. I own my own house so having to okay having a dog with a landlord is not an issue. I have a fenced in yard. I live outside of town so there’s not a ton of car or people traffic. I’m mainly afraid I won’t be a dog person in the sense that I won’t meet all of its emotional needs (since dogs are more affectionate than cats; like cats are more independent and dogs are more people loving). I’m totally prepared for the walking, playing with, training, bathing/grooming, vet costs aspects. Im excited about the aspect of having an animal I can take outdoors with me (on a proper leash/harness and after it’s trained on the off chance it breaks away from the harness) like on hikes and to the beach. I’m worried I won’t meet the dogs expectations in terms of how much love it wants since I picture myself as a cat person and they’re more independent. 

1. Do I sound like I’m ready for a dog? I don’t want to get the dog and then find out I’m not ready. If I get a dog, I’m planning to keep it for life because I know it causes animals pain and confusion when they have to be re-homed because the owner isn’t ready for it and I don’t want to be one of those people.

I want something small (not more than 20-25 pounds), probably a toy to miniature size dog, preferably fluffy (I don’t mind putting in the extra grooming effort that comes with a fluffy dog or paying a groomer regularly if necessary) that is also sturdy enough to go on hikes or to the beach with me, is adaptable (like if I were to travel with it during  summers or if I were to get involved in a serious relationship after I got the dog [adding a new person into the dogs life possibly]), and is good with cats (I have two currently and they’re both young so hopefully not going anywhere anytime soon)."

288,[Help] dog has vaginal discharge,dogs,t3_a9kv2i,3,False,False,a9kv2i,"Hi. Since yesterday, my dog has had discharge from her vagina. She is an unspayed female rescue,about 11, due to anesthesia sensitivity and a bleeding disorder.

The discharge started as kind of grayish and is now clear and slimy/stretchy. It does not smell.

I originally thought maybe she has pyometra, but her behavior is not at all abnormal. She is eating, playing, and walking...the discharge is the only thing off. I can't see vet until they get back Thursday, but just wondering what this might be? I was thinking vaginitis"
289,[DISCUSSION] why do some people put thier loved pets down?,dogs,t3_a9qqd4,15,False,False,a9qqd4,"Earlier today,  I saw a post from a person putting down thier dog.

290,[Help] sister's dog is deathly afraid of me,dogs,t3_a9hlr8,3,False,False,a9hlr8,"Apart from maybe the first interaction with me which I don't recall because I wasn't paying attention to the dogs my sister's dog has been super afraid of me. She'll pee and poop if she gets close to me. Which was a lovely incident to have inside a house. 

They believe she's a Whippet. She's a rescue dog. They have had her for a couple years now so she's full grown.  The more interaction she's had with me the more she seems to try and avoid me. It's been a little over a year of this with me trying various things like petting, giving her treats, putting food in her bowl, trying to give her no indication I'm trying to hurt her, etc..

I've never done anything to or in front of this dog to make her afraid of me. Im the 2nd person she's ever treated like this otherwise she's entirely friendly to anyone else. Im just at a loss for what I could possibly do. Any advice would be helpful. 

Im actually going to be living in the same house as this dog in a couple weeks and it'll be easy enough for the dog and I to avoid each other I think but I'd like it so that doesn't have to be a thing. 

Edit: recently they found a couple dogs that's she's aggressive towards. "
291,[HELP] Bailey likes to wonder...and pee in the house.,dogs,t3_a9kh81,1,False,False,a9kh81,"I've had my dog for two months. She has some quirks that need ironed out but really, I consider myself very lucky. Considering she's had no formal training (starts in a couple weeks) she's very well mannered. 

The two biggest issues we've noticed is her escaping and her peeing in the house. 

**Issue 1:** Bailey has escaped 3-5 times in the two months we've had her. Once a week after we got her, she pushed passed my wife and out the door. It was a rainy day and I chased her in socks. She found her own way back in the front door after a while. And twice today she escaped from my parents yard (a fenced yard she's been in several times). Today she simply jumped the fence. They have a lower 4' chain link fence. 

At my house we have a privacy, board on board,  6' fence. I'm not too worried about her escaping my yard BUT I'm disappointed she can't use my parents yard to run around in as it's much larger (about an acre). 

For Christmas I got a Whistle GPS device for her collar. I've also ordered a light up collar for her. 

She's microchipped. 

**Issue 2:** She's never been house broken (that we know of). However, she seemed to pick up on house breaking pretty quickly. She goes to the door. But, if you don't make it to the door to let her out in a matter of less than a minute (sometimes less than 10 seconds) she'll pee right at the door. 

She's also more likely to have an accident at my parents/in-laws house, despite having visted both multiple times. I don't expect her to be super great about asking to go out at other people's houses but, I figured it's worth noting. "

I haven't been sick since we got our dog over a year and a half ago. So while he was a bit weirded out that his walks weren't as long and mommy was in bed way more than normal, he took it upon himself to make sure I get better.

All day Sunday he didn't leave my side. He would lick my face after every cough and has been super snuggly! When my SO got it too he's been doing double duty and splitting his time between cuddling me and my SO. It's adorable!"

295,"[Help] House trained dog pees inside after seeing puppy pee inside - is it because dog thinks it’s ok when puppy does it, or just not fully house trained?",dogs,t3_a9h8e8,12,False,False,a9h8e8,"So I’m wondering if dogs are smart enough for this, maybe they’re not. My 1 year old dog hasn’t had an accident since we moved house almost 3 months ago (and even then it was 2x in the first week, probably because space was new in combination with stress). Now we are visiting family for the holidays (staying at my parents’ house) and my dog saw their five month puppy pee in the hallway. Today my dog out of nowhere peed in the living room after we recently let her out. Is this because she thinks it’s ok because she saw the puppy pee inside yesterday? Or is she just still not fully house trained?

296,[Help]Dog goes on manic spree of kicking carpet and anything she can.,dogs,t3_a9lpgj,1,False,False,a9lpgj,"Our dog has been having this issue lately where she not stop starts licking the carpet and then anything she can get near. After that she will begin to almost bite the air and lick her lips non stop. She has done this several times in the past.

297,[Help] Was this a near-death experience?,dogs,t3_a9llef,2,False,False,a9llef,"I believe my 11-year-old dog may have just had a near-death experience. It started with uncontrollable movement of his back half, with both hind legs shaking back and forth for about 5-10 seconds. This happened two times within 5 minutes. We thought nothing of this, but later we found him laying on the couch looking near-dead. I don't really know how to describe this, but his penis was clearly swollen and halfway out of his skin, and his anus was pulsating/flexing nonstop. He clearly could not control this, and was laying down unresponsive with his eyes nearly closed. We kept petting him and saying his name to keep him awake, but we all thought he was going to die right in front of us. After a couple minutes his penis went back to normal and his anus stopped pulsating and he was suddenly back to his old self. He is a pretty old dog and has been spaced out for the last couple years, but this was the first experience that I feel may have been deadly. Do these symptoms mean anything? A seizure maybe?

299,[HELP] Convincing someone it's time,dogs,t3_a9jmzw,5,False,False,a9jmzw,"Hello all, 

I'm hoping that some of you can help me figure out how to convince my father to unfortunately, put our dog down.

For some back story, we currently have a German Shepherd, she's 11 and half years old and has had a wonderful life. Unfortunately, over the past several months her physical health has been on a decline and of recent, has gotten to the point where you can't watch her walk. Her back legs have loss muscle, and even with meds, she has been unable to walk very well. My parents have wooden floors which for sure doesn't help. I got a floor rug to cover most of the living room and smaller pieces so she can go to the back door. On carpet, she is able to walk but on wood, it's like ice. In the morning, she is able to walk but throughout the day, it becomes more difficult till the night where she pretty much settles in where ever she lays down since she can't walk, for the night. 

The issue is her quality of life just seems like it isn't what it should be. Occasionally dragging her back legs, sometimes having to stop where she is and lay down till she can gain energy to walk, hardly walk down the two small steps on our porch to go to the bathroom. It all is just so hard to see but my father insists she's doing ok since she hasn't lost an appetite, drinks her water and still very playful. Her mind is there but her physical ability to walk is seriously not ok. I need help trying to sit my father down and telling him it's time, it's very hard to no matter what but I would like any advice any one has that had dealt with the same situation. "
300,[Breeds] Looking for the perfect breed (does it exist?),dogs,t3_a9kz7e,19,False,False,a9kz7e,"My husband and I are hoping to get a dog within the next 3-5 years. We’re both career people and have 9-5 days. While we are totally willing to go on walks and play with our dog, we do want one that can deal with apartment living without being destructive and overly energetic. (That being said, we don’t plan to get a dog until we live in an area with fenced off backyard access where they could freely roam.)

We would prefer there be tendencies toward less barking, being lazy, less clingy, less aggressive. Small-medium is preferable. 

Does any breed fit the bill? If not, any suggestions appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: I’ve owned dogs in past and know that all dogs bark. But I know some dogs howl constantly while playing, when they want attention, etc. while some mostly bark when their guard instinct is triggered. "
301,[Help] Visiting family for Xmas. My large dog pinned sisters small anxious dog,dogs,t3_a9gkuj,11,False,False,a9gkuj,"They met each other yesterday and were doing ok, but my dog (Sadie) apparently went to her dog (cassie) and put her head on top of Cassie’s, which I’ve been told is a sign of dominance?

Cassie didn’t like that and yelped, so Sadie flipped her over with her paws and mouth while Cassie yelped and tried to get away.

We broke it up and Sadie pretty much left her alone after that, but seemed mildly interested in watching her when she would walk by.

We recently adopted Sadie from a shelter where she was a stray so we’re still learning about her, but she has never shown aggressive energy towards us, my kids or my cat, she’s really been a fantastic addition to the family.

She once pinned my moms black lab as well, but that ended quick and now they’re best friends.

My main concern is that my sisters dog is consistently nervous around large dogs, and I’m worried that my dog will continue to pin/ harass Cassie if she keeps projecting nervous energy.

Is there anything I can do to help my dog leave Cassie alone? Should we scold her for it if it happens again? 

Additional info: we are visiting my moms house, she’s never been here and though she knows all the people here we have never taken her on a trip before. 

Thank you for reading this far, I’m new to raising dogs and I want to everything I can to help them get along."

Are there good clickers and bad clickers as far as quality goes? I've had clickers in the past and on occasion the clicker will fail to operate and I will miss a training cue that I wanted to hit. But, something I don't ever see is a discussion on the quality of training clickers. They all seem to be just generic clickers and you generally have no idea what you are getting until you have already bought it. I am looking for a clicker with an accurate, repeatable click point, not a spongy feeling click that is hard to predict.

309,[Help] 2 year old lab has bad car ride anxiety?,dogs,t3_a9ka1b,0,False,False,a9ka1b," Hi guys, so since a pupp my guy hasn't enjoyed car rides, he sits in the back, pants and stares at the door. He has never once vomited or anything of the likes but he seems tense. He will not calm down or sleep at all during a 2 hour or 3 hour drive. I went to the vets and told them about my issue, they said try cerenia, so I did, if it did anything it was it made him worse I think! He was drooling and looking in rough shape, better when he wasn't on it. So Im going to say it's not Motion sickness related? I try now to get him in the front seat to look out which helps  a little but then he'll lay down and get back into the panting and all.

I've currently tried cbd oil which I think helps a tad but is not the cure.

He is a super happy dog, no fears, obedient, I've tried giving treats in the. Car and he loves that but there's certainly something there. My next thing I thinj for a road trip will be asking for something to make him sleep for a few hours. We go on our road trip to see family every other month and they are 3 hours away, so it's not a often problem of course but looking to see if anybody has any other ideas? Googling almost certainly comes to motionsickness but after the cerenia, I'd Guess it's not that at all as it's a. Very effective drug for that issue.

316,[Help] 1 year old golden retriever displaying odd behavioral changes,dogs,t3_a9jd41,6,False,False,a9jd41,"My golden retriever just turned a year old in October, and recently I have noticed some changes in her behavior that are uncharacteristic for her and I want to hopefully get some advice on how I can train her and correct the behavior. For one thing, over the past couple of months, I have noticed that when we go on walks and people approach us after asking to pet her, she is very wary and often tries to stay as far away from them as she can, even after I talk to them and try to show her that there’s nothing to be afraid of. This is not something she did for her first year. She used to absolutely love everyone and want to meet them all. She did have several vet appointments over the summer (spay, eye surgery, hip sprain, small skin rash from swimming) and I’m wondering if that may have had anything to do with her fear of strangers? 

She has also over the past couple weeks been barking nonstop when she goes outside. She never used to do this. She still doesn’t ever bark in the house, but she will bark at anything and everything when she’s outside in the backyard and since it wasn’t something she used to do I’m just not sure what’s going on. 

Another issue that’s been recent is separation anxiety. If I go upstairs or go to the bathroom for even a short period of time I’ll hear her whining for me until I come back, and when I’m not home and don’t bring her with me my family says she just sleeps on my bed until I get back. This is not something that’s been an issue until recently and I’d definitely like some advice to correct this. 

TL;DR My young golden retriever has recently developed fear of strangers, separation anxiety, and will bark constantly when she’s outside in the backyard. What are some steps I can take to correct this new behavior? "

320,[Discussion] Having a large working breed dog living indoors,dogs,t3_a94q7z,134,False,False,a94q7z,"I had an interesting conversation with one of my coworkers today. She has a 4 year old St Bernard that lives outside on a farm property.  

I own a 1 and a half year old Cane Corso mix (110lbs), and I live in the city with a fenced in backyard. 

I don’t believe she was trying to be confrontational, but she made a comment that she didn’t believe it was right to have such a large breed live indoors. She told me “ I wish I could bring my dog indoors, but I can’t. It’s not right. He’s a large dog and he belongs outside.”

I told her I thought my dog was well stimulated, that he goes to daycare 3 times a week, the other days he gets 1-2hr walks at various off leash parks (a lot of them trails, more like hikes). At home he spends most of the day laying around sleeping, or chewing his bone. For 6 months I have had absolutely no problems with him chewing things he’s not suppose to, messing things up, peeing/pooping in the house, anything like that. He has free range of the house while I’m gone. At night he sleeps in his open door crate by choice.

To me, I’ve always learnt that this means you’ve met the needs of your dog. A sleepy dog is a stimulated dog. When I asked her about this she said “he’s a lazy dog, but he’s probably still really bored.”

What do you guys think?! Am I being crazy? Should I be doing more for my dog? I always thought I was doing a good job with him.  I’m not about to move to a farm, but I want him to have the best life he can.

I adopted the sweetest lab/shepherd mix on Saturday from the Portland shelter. She was spry and playful and amazing, but as the day went on, she was throwing up, had diarrhea, and gradually lost all of her energy.

I was very worried about her not eating and being lethargic, but I convinved myself she was overwhelmed from being adopted.

The next morning (yesterday), she had blood in her diarrhea and continued dry heaving. I immediately called a local emergency vet and took her in right away. I knew something about parvo but as a first time dog owner I've never experienced it. The vet took a stool sample and within 15 minutes diagnosed her with parvo. He was extremely solemn and kept saying that things didn't look good. I was a huge emotional wreck. I've been looking for an emotional support dog for about 5 months and basically loved her within 30 minutes. I felt so bad for her.

We called the Portland humane society and they immediately, and without hesitation, told us to bring her into their hosptial immediately. They took her in at no cost. She's currently being treated with IV fluids and monitored in a quarantined unit with her sister who was adopted the same day and also came down with parvo.

I still don't know what to make of it. They say her tail is wagging and she is ""perky"" but still has bowel issues. The vet seems optimistic but I'm still anxious.

So please, please, read up on parvo. A lot of people are getting puppies tomorrow morning and there is always a risk of these puppies being exposed to parvo. It can kill your puppy within 72 hours if you don't call your vet at the first sign of lethargy, vomitting, and diarrhea.

I'll make sure to update this post as I hear more from them...

327,[Help] Popped on couch + vomited undigested food on another couch,dogs,t3_a9f2bg,4,False,False,a9f2bg,"Dog is 6 months old. 

I went downstairs to find dog poop on the couch, a place she's never pooped before in the almost one month we've had her. The poop didn't look any different from her usual poops.

I also found vomit made up of pretty much undigested dog food on another couch. 

This all happened around 4 hours after she ate.

She's in her crate now as it's her bed time. When I put her in, she was a bit more restless than usual, rolling around and changing positions, but as of right now she seems fine.

It's also worth mentioning that we were at a relative's house today for Christmas, and I took her for a walk around the neighborhood. My worry is that she must have eaten something off the ground, but I had my eyes on her most of the time and didn't see anything."
328,[Help] dog experience hair loss and fur turning white,dogs,t3_a9g3uz,2,False,False,a9g3uz,"Backstory,

In June I took my dog (2 1/2 year old female spayed pitmix) with me to Dallas. During the car ride she sat in the back seat and the a/c was blowing near her face. Arrived in Dallas to the whites of my dogs eyes being pink/red. She began rubbing her eyes and keeping them closed. 

Returned to Austin and took her to the vet. Was given medicine for eye irritation. 

Eyes improved.

A week or so later her fur on the top of her head because to have large dry flakes of skin and she was losing hair. 

Back to the vet, she was diagnosed with having a bacterial skin infection.

Was given medicine over the course of 10 days, she improved. 

Fast forward to October...same thing dry flaking skin on head, muzzle and even her nose peeled and is now discolored.

Was taken back to vet and diagnosed with another bacterial skin infection. 

Same medicine and was also given an allergy shot.

Weeks go by and the skin stopped flaking....her eyes are no longer irritated but physical changes have taken place.

They dark hair around her eyes has not grown back, her nose is still discolored, her muzzle is now white and the once flaky spots on her back are now filled with white hair.

She is now losing hair starting on her hind legs. It’s moving towards her tail area. 

I’m at a loss. I plan on taking her back to the vet Friday. I do not feel as though the vet looked into the root cause deep enough at the beginning. 

Any suggestions? Do I try my same vet again or go to a new vet? Her physical appearance is night and day different. No dog that is two years old should have fur that turns white and be losing this much hair. "

340,[Help] I’m at my in-laws’ house for Christmas and my FIL just slapped my dog in the face. I’m upset and I don’t know what to do.,dogs,t3_a9boq0,13,False,False,a9boq0,"I have two dogs. The little one has this quirk where when you lead the older one by the collar, she starts barking at him. I don’t know why, but she does. So we just don’t do that around her. I’ve always hated the way my FIL treats my dogs (yelling at them in German when they know zero German commands, we’re all Americans, and things like that). But today the older one was outside and I guess FIL didn’t want him outside anymore because he went out and dragged him in by the collar. To be fair, he didn’t know this would set the little one off. But I saw it coming so I grabbed her collar to keep her away from the older dog as he was being dragged in. 

Anyways, she starts barking and the older one starts barking back. Then FIL reaches down and slaps him in the face. I said “don’t hit him please” And FIL said “oh sorry.” I told him I could take both dogs. When they get into a bark-off we put them in their kennels for cooldown time. But he wouldn’t let the older dog go. He kept holding his collar as I said “I’ve got this.” Eventually he slipped his collar because he was trying to get to me and so I led him gently by the scruff to his kennel. 

Both dogs were very very wound up for a while. Right now I’m sitting with them in the den, they’re asleep in their separate kennels, and I’m crying and I don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to drive home because I don’t want to be around someone who slapped my dog. But I also don’t want to cause drama and ruin Christmas. "

347,[HELP] severe seperation anxiety with aggression,dogs,t3_a99irr,10,False,False,a99irr,"I’ve posted about my dog Dixon before about this issue. He’s a 3 year old catahoula with seperation anxiety issues. He’s on Prozac currently. He has had instances of getting aggressive (growling, snarling, barking, biting, scratching,etc) when I leave my apartment. I moved recently but made sure to make it a slow move and I took a week off to get him acclimated. Everything was fine. He let me leave for work and most evenings without any issue.

Then last Wednesday my boyfriend slept over. Thursday morning my boyfriend left when I took Dixon out for his walk. Before work I usually try to go for 20-30 minutes. Then we got back inside and I got all of his toys and food ready and he did his desperate “don’t leave me” aggressive thing. 

I know I’m gonna get heat for this but I had to tie him up to my bed so I could get out of my apartment without being bit. I don’t feel good about doing it but I also can’t miss work. I’ve had to tie him up every time I left since that day. I absolutely hate it but it’s the only thing I can do right now that will keep me safe. I understand it is not safe for him but unfortunately my safety is more important. 

I’m exploring seperation anxiety training but it requires that he cannot be left alone during the duration of the training. I’m not sure I can afford five days a week of daycare/dog sitting for a month (or more). I’m also not sure there’s a daycare out there that would take him considering he’s iffy with other dogs. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on what to do until he can start this anxiety training. And maybe some words of encouragement because I’m starting to consider rehoming/surrendering because I’m at my wits end and I’m hating the fear I feel every time I try to leave my apartment. "

356,[HELP] I thought I wasn't a dog person... Turns out I just hate my boyfriend's dog,dogs,t3_a8whm2,288,False,False,a8whm2,"***update***

So I've started letting Louis out more frequently and I don't actively encourage him to drink water at night as I used to do.

He's more manageable now at the very least. Here still complains if left in the cage with no one else in the room but I consider that to be semi reasonable and I work at home so it's inconvenient but not a crippling issue.

He can't be trusted to walk around the house unsupervised because he will still Mark and hide the larger puddles of pee in hard to get to areas. The local humane society was closed for the holidays but once they get back open I'll set a date for his fixing.

One of his major bad behaviors is humping aggressively and uncontrollably for the first few days we were here Dixie barked at him and visibly restrained herself from killing him because all he wanted to do was barrel across the house with his snout stuffed in her crotch. He still does a certain amount of this and I have to imagine this will stop altogether one he's snipped.

We lost his leash in the move so I'll have to get a new one, those of you with specialized knowledge and/or experience I'd appreciate if you have a recommended leash for a 3lb dog.

BTW a lot of you have developed some misunderstandings here. I mostly haven't corrected people because I didn't think it was terribly germane to the subject of dogs or having a dog but I'll at least offer some peace to those of you who appear to have gotten the most excited about the situation.

1. My boyfriend insists that Louis' behavior was better before we moved in together. He feels guilt over the fact that in a four-year period Louis has had to change homes 5 times with Louis not even being 6 years old. His defensiveness is centered around that guilt and the conjecture that that stress of constant moving has caused Louie so much stress that he's regressed and acts now like he did as a new puppy. (I know that can happen to humans but I'm not super sure that's a thing that can happen to dogs).

My boyfriend even goes so far as to suggest that Louis is acting out in retaliation to bad treatment. I may not know dogs very well but I was a behavioral Neuroscience major so I know for a fact that only the most intellectually advanced social animals are capable of calculated indirect aggression of this sort. I no longer argue with him on that point I just roll my eyes and try to change the subject to doing something more productive than hand-wringing.

 
2. We only have Louis because my boyfriend's previous partner neglected them both, to go out and cheat with other men. So he got stuck with Louis in part because he bonded while trying to keep the dog cared for as his real owner ignored him and part because Louis was a companion during bad times. 

3. My boyfriend has trained dogs up to a decent level of behavior before. He owned pitbulls as a child and successfully trained a St Bernard named Bruno up from puppyhood to be very well behaved (or so his relations tell me). Bruno got hit by a car when he was 4 years old, two years before my bf and I met.

4. We both have ample experience with children. He raised his niece as a single father from 15 to 23. I'm satisfied with his ability to impart good values to a human. I co parented my nephew with my sister from the time I was 11. So I'm not particularly concerned

5. This isn't super relevant but a lot of you seem to think I'm a woman. As a 6'2, 270 pound man this is a rare and amusing experience for me.


***Update***

I always wanted a dog growing up, I come from a Caribbean family and we were not particularly close to other animals. what's more, my mother always feared dogs and not without good reason; my older brother got mauled on the legs pretty badly when I was about four or five.

so I went into adulthood knowing that there's a lot I would have to discover if I ever became a dog owner.

As of about 3 years ago I moved in with my boyfriend who already owned a black chihuahua named louie. And I f****** hate this dog. He pees in the house constantly no matter how many times you take him outside, he steals food, is incredibly disobedient, sometimes it will randomly take a s*** in the house. We tried crate training and all he does is whine and bark constantly until you let him out at which point he will choose one or two spots around the yard to pee in and then expect to come back in the house to relieve himself the rest of the way. Worse than that he will start baking in the middle of the night to be let out, sometimes its 3, 4 or 5 a.m. at which point I wake up make sure he gest something to eat &amp; drink, then let him out to do his business.
that wouldn't be so bad except when I bring him back inside our room and put him back in his cage to sleep next to us he just starts whining again, there are times when he'll do this five times a night.
 Worse yet, my boyfriend is a heavy sleeper who never hears him so it's always my job.


from this experience I just assumed that maybe I'm not a dog person.

But we recently started renting a room from my boyfriend's mom and she has a deaf Pitbull-mix, named Dixie. Dixie is objectively, the goodest girl, despite being deaf she always listens to commands, never steals food, always wants to cuddle, holds her bowels or bladder for half a day if she needs to, she's gentle with children, loves to play but isn't rambunctious and is generally a respectful lovable dog on all levels, I give her a kiss on the forehead Everytime I see her. She is a joy to have around and I feel bad whenever people don't make time for her.

So now I've discovered that I don't hate dogs, I just hate this particular chihuahua Louis. The hatred is deep enough that I have actually thought to myself that if Louie dies or gets lost I need to remember not to seem happy because I'm sure my boyfriend will be devastated. The other day I was preparing some candy to take to the old folks home where my boyfriend works.  I stepped away for a second and Louie jumped up onto the furniture and ripped into one of the bags.

The candy is not that expensive so I was only moderately angry about the fact that he made a mess but I actually thought to myself that I wished I had bought dark chocolate instead of cheap milk chocolate for the residents so that maybe he would've just died from eating it without anyone blaming me specifically.

my boyfriend insists that he doesn't need any training and that we just need to get him fixed which for the record we've only had the money to do in the last week or two(we used to have roommates that never paid their rent so money was always tight up until now and we didn't want to ruin our credit by breaking a lease).

I'll happily get him fixed but I doubt that these crappy behaviors are purely the result of having testicles. I'm just barely tolerating this dog as it is and I'd really like some guidance 

I know Chihuahuas live a long time so I'm hoping I can find a better solution than praying for the death of this creature.

My husband and i carry her outside, bring her water and food, etc. She still eats normally, has normal regular bowel movements and has control of her bowels and lets us know when she needs to go outside. She takes joint supplements, a NSAID, and CBD oil. Lately she seems to be in more pain. Panting more, whining more, where we can not figure out what she needs. In past it was typically communication for a need like water, food, outside, repositioned etc. Now she will continue whining after trying to give her all her basic needs. So im assuming its pain. Last few moths she seems more depressed and uninterested in anything that used to give her joy. She was a licker and anytime we were near her she would strain to give us kisses. Those have stopped. We have a wagon and wheel her around the neighborhood to sniff things, she no longer has an interest or gets excited on those trips. How do I know when it is time to say goodbye. Im struggling because her internal organs are functioning fine at the moment. I have tremendous guilt for thinking about this just due to pain and mobility. Is it her time? and I being selfish for holding onto her? What if she's not in as much pain as i think? I always thought I would know for sure when it was time but I have so many doubts right now that I don't know what to do. She will be the first dog I will have to make this decision. lost a dog to cancer in June and he died peacefully at home so mother nature helped me out on that one.

359,[Discussion] How to help my dog be more comfortable in the car,dogs,t3_a97mb8,9,False,False,a97mb8,"I have a 50-lb four year old bully X herder mix who is fearful of the car. I need to drive with her for 500 miles after the holidays (it was either that or leave her at a boarding facility but her high anxiety makes that close to impossible). Normally in a regular vehicle she likes to ball herself up behind the drivers seat (on the floor behind between the rear seat and the back of the front seat). She feels most comfortable there in a very tight space (secure) while being close to us. 

Our upcoming trip will be in a different vehicle (Eurovan) that doesn’t have rear seats or any tight spaces so I’m looking for ideas on how to make her more comfortable. Ideally she would be between the seats in a very tight, secure spot. I’m considering making a small wooden box with three sides she can jam herself into if she wants. A crate is too flimsy — it scares her if there’s any movement or rattling. 

On her own she will try to jam herself under the drivers legs in this vehicle which isn’t safe (brake/gas pedals!) so I’m really hoping to find an alternative. To those of you thinking leave her at home, it’s not possible in this instance (we normally do). "
360,[Help] Time for a second dog?,dogs,t3_a9655j,11,False,False,a9655j,"So my husband and I are considering a second dog. But I want to make sure we are 100% ready before we jump in. I'm looking for any advice, information, and personal anecdotes you can give me.

Our current dog is a golden retriever. He is almost 2 years old. And while he was a tough puppy when we first got him he has turned into an incredible dog. He knows over 30 commands, walks well on a leash, and absolutely loves other dogs! His favorite place is the dog park and he tends to be the most popular dog there. 

We have a pretty established routine down. We take him on an outing every day. Whether it be a long walk, a trip to the dog park, or up to the mountains for a hike. 

We are looking for a slightly smaller breed than a golden retriever, probably around 2 years old, and are hoping to adopt from a shelter. 

We also have had other dogs stay over at our house before (we are Rovers) and our dog has shown no sign of resource guarding or aggression to a dog in his house. In fact he always seems a little sad when they leave.

He’s not aggressive towards dogs even when they’re barking right in his face, and usually at least sniffs them before just watching them run around him. Should I try to socialize him more?

She's super sweet mellow 6 year old lady, I have absolutely no clue what breed she is, current owner is pretty clueless also. She looks like a mix of ACD, Golden Retriever, Corgi.. She was found as stray few years ago and scooped off from streets. The current owner has had her for 2 years, but their work situation changed and the dog is home alone \~12h a day so they gave her up for adoption. I'm adopting through [getyourpet.com](https://getyourpet.com) site and so far the experience with it has been very good.

But, aside from that, my dream has always been having a bunny too. Are there any dog&amp; bunny owners here? What should I look out for? I was thinking of maybe a baby bunny would be better so they could get used to the dog and not be afraid of it. Ultimately I'd love them to be buddies, both free range. I'm fairly sure the dog is fine, based on the owner's description she's just the sweetest, never shows teeth and is all about pleasing hoomans.

366,[Help] Training advice for new puppy,dogs,t3_a97tfn,4,False,False,a97tfn,"Hi all,

My gf and I adopted a Siberian husky puppy two weeks ago and we’ve been having a blast with her. She’s incredibly smart and doing really great with the introductory training things. She’s actually the most chill puppy we’ve ever seen and we are frequently told that.

The only issue we’ve repeatedly had since getting her is when we have to leave and cannot take her with us. 

For example, every time we leave to get food or go to church things which take less than an hour and a half to two hours, she soils her crate and we always come back with her whining. 

On the other hand, she sleeps through most of the night. We started taking her out every 2 hours when we got her but now she can sleep for 4-5 hours without needing to potty during the night. Granted she knows someone is in the same room as her at these times. But she’s never had an accident during the night or whined except for the first night we had her. 

I don’t think this is a separation anxiety, as I’m sure she’s still adjusting to everything and wants to be with her “pack.”  Thoughts? 

She gets plenty of attention and exercise during the day. 

What are your guys’ recommendations on how to improve this? I’m wondering if it’s a simple as leaving progressively longer starting with just a few minutes then coming back. For kennel/crate training we did the suggested letting her get into it on her own time. She will get in on her own it when prompted with a treat. She’s on a consistent feeding and potty schedule outside these random times when we need to leave the house for a short time. 

I’ve also wondered if that above solution is the case, if we leave the room for, say 5 minutes, and she whines so we need to wait until she quiets or has an accident or return and just reduce the attempted time we try to leave until she’s never whining? Most would say not to budge until the whining stops, but I’ve also seen some say having an accident voids that and you should attend to the dog and the accident. 

Thanks for the help! Open to any suggestions and methods. "

She went back in and I waited until she was sleeping and shut the door.

Anyways, it’s now one in the morning and we have a very large outdoor deck that I kept seeing her under but every time she spots me she books it back to the woods. I just checked again to see if she went into her crate because it’s 25 degrees out and she must be cold! And what do you know, she sees me from the other side and books it again towards the woods. 

I’m at a lose. This dog is clearly not going to listen to a recall or come close to us at this point. How do we catch her? Help!

While looking for the owner, a family told us the puppy was abandoned by someone who drove away.  We went to 4 different shelters, but no shelter was able to help.  We were told abandoned dogs are common in our area and shelters are overwhelmed.  They did check for a chip, but there wasn't one or a collar.

We ended up taking the puppy home and got the puppy checked out by a vet.  The vet estimated the puppy is around 10-13 weeks old with relatively good health besides being underfed.  We think the puppy is a boxer terrier mix.  We've seen no behavior issues so far.

We're trying to find the owner, but we don't like our chances.  Original owner finding dependent, we'll likely end up keeping our new furry friend.   However, we both work full time and weren't expecting a dog yet, and neither of us have had a dog since we were kids, so we're not studied up, and we want to do right by the puppy.  As it stands, the puppy will be alone from roughly 730-12 and 1-4.  Is there anything we should look out for or try to do? Is a dog walker appropriate for a puppy that young?

379,[Help] My 8 month old puppy is choosing to not be potty trained.,dogs,t3_a96ket,13,False,False,a96ket,"Ok little bit of context: about 7 months ago I adopted a puppy from someone’s back yard. She was in bad shape but we got her fixed up and she’s been a great addition to our family. We already had an older dog who is perfect, never barks, perfectly house trained, and just a lovely dog. When we brought the puppy home we started crate training her; she was in the crate during the day while we were at work (we would come home and take her out on lunch) and then she was in the crate at night while we slept. She only ever had two accidents in the crate right at the beginning, but then never again. So clearly she knows how to hold it.

When we first got her we were living in a small studio apartment, and it was making potty training very hard. She would get out of her crate and pee on the floor right away, before we even had a chance to take her out. So we got the idea to use a pierce of turf outside on the porch. And it worked perfectly. She stopped having accidents inside and would go out to use the turf. We still took her outside regularly but the pad was there if she ever needed it in the middle of her outside trips. 

So about a month ago we moved into a new house with a huge yard, we haven’t got it fenced in yet, but it’s made walking both the dogs much easier. However this is the issues: since moving the puppy has almost chosen to not be potty trained. She just pees now whenever she wants and it’s driving us crazy! We’ll be in the kitchen and she’ll just walk in and pee right there next to us, after having just been on a walk 10 minutes before! She’s also started pooping on the new back porch and peeing out there too! I’m worried she now is confused about where to pee and when. But she knows how to hold it so I dont understand why she just pees whenever she feels like it?! She’s a very smart Aussie mix and I’m worried she’s choosing to disobey. Please help! "

It's a great feeling when I see pets return after staying with us for their first time, and even better when they're actually excited!! 

I was looking through our business page at all of the clients being excited to see their animals having a good time, and was just really happy to know that the pictures that were posted weren't staged or fake - the animals were truly having a good time.

381,[RIP]GoodBye Malka,dogs,t3_a8yf1u,5,False,False,a8yf1u,"A furry friend came into my life, many years ago, who changed my life forever. She taught me invaluable lessons and accepted me no matter what. I knew she was genuinely happy to see me every time I came home and I am a better man because of my time with her. She died in my arms last night after a full life and on her own terms, comforted by the ones she trusted, her family.

A little back story. Malka was a lab-mix born a little shy of ten years ago, we think. As she was rescued from an abusive home, we never knew her exact birthday. She was beaten and abandoned when she was only a pup, left without food and water for over a week. She was on death's door when they found her, besides being emaciated, she was ravished by parasites and most of her hair was falling out. We met her 8 weeks later, her health revived, her hair grown in but she was scarred. It was evident. she was the most skittish dog I'd ever seen, scared of everything and everybody. There were 5 other dogs at the foster she was with, and she was always the last one to eat, last one to come in and obviously anti-social. But when I saw her nine years ago I knew. As she peeked her head out of the house, all I could see were her ears, and they were magnificent! They were tall, and she  maneuvered them masterfully, so much that we would learn to gauge her mood from them. When they were fully extended, at full alert, she had the passing resemblance to a bat. I knew this ridiculous creature needed my love. What I didn't know was it was I that needed her love far more.

A couple days later, paperwork completed and adoption approved, she finally came home and what a handful. The representative from the rescue told us she was unadoptable and said ""when"" you bring her back instead of ""if"". Looking back, I think his words gave us an extra resolve to show him wrong, to show him that she was not damaged beyond repair. He was dropping her off at our house with the foster and as Malka saw the only human she'd learned to trust walk out of her life she let out the most heartbreaking howl I had ever heard. It was long and loud, filled with the pain only she knew. We had to keep her leash on constantly for an entire week, even in the house, to keep her calmed. She needed to be in the same room as we were, but didn't want to be too close. I had to carry her down 4 flights of stairs to do her business because she was petrified of the elevator and had no idea how to navigate the steps. She slept at the foot of our bed, but wouldn't get in, she followed us everywhere around the house but always at a safe distance. She was a mess, but she was our mess.

Besides the howl, Malka was uncommonly quiet, no barking or growling or even crying. She didn't vocalize at all for almost a year, until a day I will never forget. She was sitting on a day bed she had commandeered overlooking the parking lot of the apartment complex and we heard something. We didn't know what it was, it was totally unfamiliar and it was coming from the dog. It wasn't quite a bark, but it was something. We hadn't known if she would ever have a voice and here we heard her learning to speak again. We now believe she was beaten for barking and it was at this point that she trusted us enough to know we would never hurt her. Over time her bark became commonplace as she warded off the delivery drivers, let us know when she had to go or sassily talked back. It was about this time that she began sleeping in bed with us, whether we invited her or not. She started out staying down by our feet, but it didn't take long before she started to sneak in between us as we slept. Some of my fondest memories involve her rolling around on her back, squirming and knocking the pillows off with her nose.

After much time, work and love she finally felt safe and her role as protector really started to come out. When we took her to dog parks she always stayed close to us, and would aggressively bar her teeth at any dog she thought got too close to her Mom and Dad. She wouldn't eat until we both got home from work and was always at the door to greet us. If we were sick or upset she was always right there to comfort us and she showed her gratitude every single day. As the days went by the haunted look in her eyes started to subside, but would sometimes come out when she felt threatened. Thunder and vacuums, fishing poles and broom handles along with a myriad of other things were terrifying to her. Taking her out of her comfort zone could be challenging and getting her nails clipped at the groomer could be a herculean feat. She loved vacations but hated getting there and would cry and whine the whole way in transit, but when we arrived she would be so happy to be with us no matter our destination.

Malka, I hope your new destination is filled with open fields to run and squeaky toys to play with. You will never be forgotten.

His name is Ghost and hes 1 year and 6 months. at the shelter he was the only dog who wasn't barking, and he seemed very timid. But when we got him out in the training room by himself he opened up a bit and was a pretty sweet dog. His papers say he likes women, but men need to approach cautiously because he spooks. I'm a 6""4 male and he initially cowered away but after kneeling down and letting him approach hes perfectly fine with me. But it makes me think maybe he came from an abusive home before. Here are my concerns I have now:

He knows his name, he perks up when you say it, but he just does not come. Hes house broken, but doesn't appear to know commands. When i try to get him to go outside or get off the bed so we can try and feed him, he just sits there. Gently pulling on his collar or coaxing him doesnt work. Being more firm and pushing him, he hunkers down and resists hard. We practically have to lift him off the bed to get him to come.

He doesnt eat. It's only the first night having him, but I made a bowl of his food that he ate at the shelter and he ignores it. Doesnt respond to treats either. Lady at the groomer tried to give him 3 types of treats and he just sat there looking happy.  I'm chalking this up to stress and nervousness, but am concerned all the same. 

He pants. A LOT. And drools. A LOT. In our cozy front room (he loves our couch) its about 72 degrees. He pants. In our room, we have the fan going and it's closer to about 50-55 degrees. He pants. All the while, slowly dripping drool. 

He strikes me as an old soul. He seems very content and calm. His tail wags when you pet him and he has no problem with you sitting next to him. But he gets timid when hes not laying on the couch or the bed. Hell wander around sometimes and if I pop into the room, he b-lines back to the couch or bed. We try to encourage him and pet him and baby talk him so he knows hes loved but he doesnt seem to respond well. Frankly, I'm worried he might be a little bit slow just because of how calm and retreated he is. Not that that would change how we love him at all. 


We have a German shepherd beagle mix and a German shepherd doberman mix and he acclimated very well to them. No problem sharing the bed with them and no aggression. But he doesnt attempt to play with them, or interact with them at all really. 


So that's the list of concerns I have. This is my first adoption that has been like this. What do I chalk up to ""new environment nervousness"" and what do i need to look deeper into? Also an advice about this breed would be awesome. Hes the biggest, and longest haired dog I've had so it's a bit new "

386,[Help] Should I keep my Beagle in this situation or not?,dogs,t3_a95pm5,5,False,False,a95pm5,"Hello.

Our last dog died 4 days ago(17 years old). She was mixed breed, a small, but very hardy dog. As long as she had food, a bit of affection and a short walk, she was happy. We used to keep her outside, free to roam the yard. Lived most of her life together with her mom, which passed away in 2009. 

The vet which took care of her said that he's got a dog for adoption which might suit us, after the old one died. I expected something like a mixed breed, or a puppy stray dog, but it was an 11 month male Beagle, quite a nice one actually.

So, I've adopted him and having him for 3 days. I took him for walks, played with him, bought him some toys, all the good stuff. 

However, big problem. I'm still living with my parents for a while, and they will not, accept having him indoors. So, whenever I'm not walking him, or playing, he is mostly alone in the backyard, and I can tell he's not really enjoying it, as he is always ''asking'' for attention, or scratching the doors and stuff. I have tried to make them understand that this is not a dog that can be left outside, but they cannot comprehend, for the sake of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:

&amp;#x200B;

Will he get used to this lifestyle? Is this unhealthy for him?  (especially during winter) 

By this I mean being solitary a significant amount of time of the day. He's got a nice cozy shelter, but I feel that is not enough, during winter.

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I just give him away to somebody whom I can trust, and which will accept keeping him indoors, and be most of the time in his company?

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, I'd keep him, because I like him. But in the end, if that's not healthy for him, I will not, and I will give it to somebody I can trust. 

Keep it, or give it away?"

I can’t tell if he’s playing me for a fool so he can get tastier food, or if he’s in legitimate pain. 

I’ve wondered for awhile if he’s having an issue with his teeth. His breath is atrocious, and there was a strange crunching noise in his mouth about a year ago. I took him in then, and numerous vets told me that it’s too dangerous to put him under anesthesia to check his teeth, he probably just has dirt in his mouth, and any issues would likely resolve on their own. He does like to chew on sticks and dirt when I’m not looking, so I went with it. He was eating with no issues.

He’s had TPLO surgery on his knee and no one mentioned the risks then (2016), so I’m confused why it’s an issue now. The earliest I could get another appointment is Jan. 2, but I want to be prepared when I go in. Anyone have any advice?

410,[HELP] Dog has bitten me 3 times,dogs,t3_a8vqaf,17,False,False,a8vqaf,"About a year ago we adopted a retired hunting hound from our local shelter. We quickly discovered that if anything woke her up, she would attack it. She bit me in the face about a month after we got her. We didn't want to get rid of her, as its obviously just because she was never a pet before. We also think she may have been abused by her last owner. 

We've hired 2 trainers, the first one thought we needed to earn her trust, and gave us some exercises to do with her. Hand feeding her, talking to her in certain ways, etc.  She got better for a while, until one day I was vaccuming the house and she jumped off the couch barking and snarling and chased me into the sunroom. She jumped against the doors a few times and snapped her teeth at me a bit before walking away. (The doors are glass so i could see her)  I was so scared that I just stayed in there till my husband got home. 

So we talked to our vet, she put her on Prozac and had us start doing desensitization exercises. Giving her people food when scary things are happening (like the vacuum or thunderstorms), waking her up gently from far away by talking to her, taking her for more walks in more varied locations, etc.  This Also worked for a while but she started slipping back into the aggression slowly just growling and barking but not attacking. 

We hired a 2nd trainer, who everyone said was great. That trainer insisted the dog saw us as other dogs, not as her people parents, and tried to get us to be more dominant with her. Correcting her when she did wrong, not allowing her on furniture, us controling inside/outside/play/nap/kennel time, no more people food. This broke the dog. The dog started snapping and growling again, but not biting so we stopped doing what this trainer said. 

It's been maybe 2 months since we stopped that and the dog seemed pretty much back to normal until last night. We were all sitting on the couch, me, my husband, and the dog watching a movie. I'm not sure what triggered it, maybe a loud noise in the video, or maybe I moved slightly, and the dog bit me twice on the arm. No warning growl or anything. 

I've called every other trainer in a 2 hour radius and with the exception of one lady who uses shock collars, which we are unwilling to do, everyone says they can't help. I really want to help this dog, but I'm at my wits end. I don't know where else to turn, I'm scared to be alone in the house with her, I know it isnt her fault, but after being attacked 3 times I just can't trust her. 

I made a new account for this because I know I sound like a horrible person, but I had no where else to turn about this. Does anyone have any advice on what to do?!  How can we help her?  Can she be helped?  Should we just rehome her?  I love her, but I'm scared to death of her. "

My boyfriend and I rescued a dog 4 days ago. Luna is one and a half, so smart and incredibly sweet; kisses and cuddles right off the bat!

She’ll be doing fine on the leash, like she knows what’s expected of her, and then she will *very suddenly* act frantic and run as far and fast as she can against the leash, over and over and over. Jumping at its end. Even if we stand still and wait for her to come to us, she won’t come she’ll just keep jumping against it, over and over again. Then (like she’s done it before) slips out of her collar OR harness and runs right to the elevator. (Our apartment has a rooftop area with a dog park, thankfully her slipping out hasn’t happened on the road yet). We don’t know what do to.. Obviously we’re afraid to walk her out on the street because she slips out of her stuff so easy, no matter how tight we set it. We don’t know her breed (their guess was border collie but honestly she could be anything..), we will take her to a training course but it doesn’t start until January 8th. What do we do in the meantime? Suddenly freaking out on her leash is really her only major issue."
416,[HELP] Is there anything else I could have done?,dogs,t3_a8vfuc,14,False,False,a8vfuc,"So I'll start by saying I am absolutely obsessed with my puppy and I only want what is best for him. He is close to 7 months now, he's a cocker spaniel mix and he is about 20 lbs. He will likely be a little over 25 lbs fully grown. I have put an immense amount of time, effort and resources into training and socializing him.  


Part of the effort I put into socializing him is walking him and taking him to the dog park. For the most part, this has been an incredibly positive experience. The park is just one big fenced in area - it is not separated into bigger and smaller dog areas. They only dedicate a single hour on one day of the week for 'small dogs,' though in my experience no one is ever there. So for the most part, we will take him and he plays with all of the dogs.  


This has never been a problem in the past. He LOVES other dogs and from what I have noticed actually prefers playing with bigger dogs. I find he can be a bit too rough with smaller dogs and his energy scares them away. So this morning my puppy and I came there bright and early. We were the only ones there, so I started working on his recall, which went really well. A while later another medium to larger sized dog came in and my puppy and it started playing. Another couple of dogs came in (all medium-large in size) and my puppy loved it. He was having fun chasing and being chased by the other dogs, sniffing lots of bums, you know regular dog things.  


At this point, there was probably about 5 dogs in total including my puppy. That's when another medium sized dog came in and immediately started being kind of pushy with my puppy. He would growl and chase him around and then bat him and roll him over and then trample him a bit. This made me so sad to watch and eventually two other dogs started joining in and my dog was being chased/batted/rolled over and trampled by 3 dogs.   


At this point I'm trying to grab my dog and take him out because I can see the dog that's just come in has actually started biting my puppy a bit. I'm calling my puppy and his recall has improved, so he's trying to run over but then the other dogs keep chasing/trying to bite him. The dog's owners aren't doing anything, just standing there watching/talking. Finally my puppy runs to me with his tail between his legs. He is obviously terrified and I feel like such an asshole.... I take him out of there and check it for any sore spots and he's okay.   


We walked home no problem, but I felt so guilty the entire time. I feel so stupid for going into the dog park when it wasn't the small dog hour. I should have just waited... It just usually isn't a problem. I take him to the park multiple times a week and that has never happened.   


Is there anything I could have done differently? I have thought of a potential solutions in the future:

1) I only go during the small dog hour, even if there aren't any other dogs there we can work on his recall. Will also call the city and request to have more small dog hours implemented, or even suggest having the park split into two sections for small and big dogs.  


Or should I just continue going to the park as usual? I feel so bad I do not want my puppy to have a negative experience/association with other dogs. He is such a sweetheart and literally loves every other dog. "

418,[Breeds] Looking for medium energy dog for family with children ages 5 and 7 - Help Please!,dogs,t3_a8vdoj,20,False,False,a8vdoj," 

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes, this will be our first dog.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We would prefer a rescue.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

We are a family with young children - ages 5 and 7 - so a child-friendly dog is a must. We would like a medium energy dog who enjoys playtime but is also able to calm down and enjoy hanging around the house with the family. We would also prefer a dog that doesn't shed or slobber a lot, however this is negotiable.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We were originally interested in golden retrievers and labs because of their reputation for being family-friendly dogs, however we are open to any breed/type.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

We would like a dog that can easily be walked on a leash and can follow basic commands.

**Care Commitments**

1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

My husband works from home, so although he will need to be working he is okay with having the dog around throughout the day. In the evening, I am fine with taking time to walk the dog and play with it.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

We have a medium sized fenced-in backyard that the dog will have access to, as well as 1-2 walks per day. We are okay with occasionally taking visits to a dog park as well.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We don't have much experience with dog grooming, but are willing to try to learn to do it at home.

**Personal Preferences**

1. What size dog are you looking for?

We are unsure on what the perfect size dog would be for our family. It's not a huge factor for us.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I do not want a dog that is constantly barking. I would prefer to not have to deal with a large amount of shedding and slobber, but that is less important to me than the barking.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

This is not something that we consider largely important. It would be nice, however our yard is fenced so the times when this would be necessary are minimal.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

We would like a dog that enjoys snuggling but is also fine with doing its own thing.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

An eager to please dog would be good for the children, however we are also fine if the dog is slightly independent.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

We do not want a dog that is going to bark at or be aggressive toward house guests.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, we do not want a dog that is aggressive in any way.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

The biggest factor is finding a dog that will not be aggressive towards the children.

**Lifestyle**

1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

My husband works from home, so the dog will not be left alone for long hours. However, he will be working and won't be able to be playing with the dog during that time, so the dog will have to be able to be independent enough to tolerate that. On the weekends, the dog may be left alone for a few hours (3-4) occasionally.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

No one in the family has owned a dog before. Both adults are willing to be equally involved in caring for the dog, but we are looking for a dog that is good for a first-time owner.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No, we do not plan on having other pets.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, we have two boys ages 5 and 7.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No, we are homeowners. There are no dog restrictions in our HOA.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in a town just south of Nashville, Tennessee. There are no laws that we are aware of that ban certain breeds.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

A typical summer day is usually around 90 degrees and a typical winter day is usually around 45.

**Additional Comments**

We have been looking into golden retrievers and came across this dog in particular. Any comments specifically regarding him would be especially appreciated.

However, now I have a new problem... I might be allergic. I have had minor allergies to trees and grass but these are the most severe allergies I have ever had. They started about a week after I got him and it feels like the worst cold ever along with super itchy red eyes. I went to the doctor for an allergy test to be sure and haven't gotten the results yet but I don't know what else it could be. I grew up with dogs and I am around friends and family dogs all the time and have never had any issue.  Could I suddenly become allergic to dogs? 

I am currently taking Allegra and Sudafed but its doing very little to help. My doctor suggested giving him up if I am allergic, but I cant even imagine doing that. Is there anything better I can take or other things I can do to prevent my allergies from being so severe? I gave him a bath the day I got him and just gave him a second one.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was at work when we got a call and I answered, it was my mom screaming and freaking out, going on about how my dog was dying and his flesh was falling off, my boss immediately recognized my panic, I must've paled. I couldn't think, she just said, ""Go"" and I booked it. I rushed to my house, picked him up, and sped to an emergency hospital. According to my mom, he was crying in pain and suffering. I didn't even have a chance to look at him as they just did a tape wrap around him with a towel.

I hate my mom.

The whole car ride there he was perfectly fine. In fact, I realized he was a little too fine and started to calm down, once I reached the emergency hospital. I brought him down from the car, brought him inside and no one was panicking. I didn't' understand anything. The vet removed the towel and.... There was some pieces of skin missing, nothing to go call me to work about screaming, yes it looked mildly displeasing, but the horror, the panic, the disgust, the unnecessary drama, my mom is a fucking idiot. The money that I had saved up, now half of it is gone, because of her stupidity. Because she's an idiot. I hate her. I hate her so much right now.

The vet told me **not to give him surgery and to let the flesh rot off. He kept insisting it was a burn.** I have an appointment for Wednesday for a surgery and now I'm being encouraged not to let him get the surgery. I'm going **insane**. It's been three months of this nonstop, I haven't been sleeping right, I've skimmed on eating just to save up for his vet visits, I haven't even been able to finish applying for the colleges (I need to do portfolios), I haven't been able to do anything but work and take care for my sick dog.

When will it end? When will he be okay? When will my dog just be healthy again? I don't think I can keep doing this for another two months, I'm so tired, it hurts to think about euthanizing him but if the vets aren't going to help him, what difference will it make? My mom kept going on about how he was suffering and crying, and the only reason why he was crying is because people came over and he didn't want to be in quarantine, he wanted to go say hi and play outside. That's why he was crying. I just don't know what to do anymore, I honestly don't. No one is helping and the vets still haven't given him a proper diagnosis this is beyond frustrating...

423,"[Help] My dog never takes medicine, she smells/tastes it despite her NEEDING it tremendously",dogs,t3_a8vfmh,24,False,False,a8vfmh,"Hi all,

My dog has been having severe arthritis issues this winter to the point where she is having a very hard time walking. We've been to a couple of vets and I have a friend who is a veterinarian and knows what she is doing, so she's been helping me out a lot. Long story short, we've been giving her meds in the past for her seizures which so far, knock on fake wood, she hasn't had any more.

But now that her arthritis is acting up, we've been giving her CBD Oil and Gabapentin mixed in with human food (because she will NEVER eat it with her food, for some reason). She's the type of dog that doesn't eat that much food, always been that way. But she needs to take this Gabapentin and CBD Oil (both liquid) in order for her to start walking better again. We even try just inserting the meds straight into her mouth but she will get extremely anxious and either shake her head to get it out or maybe even nip at us, in an extreme case. 

What the hell do I do... I need Lucy to take her meds. Do you guys have any tips/tricks for stubborn dogs when giving meds?"

425,[Help] Can't seem to teach my dog anything,dogs,t3_a8wa7k,6,False,False,a8wa7k,"My golden retriever of about a year and 2 months doesn't seem to respond to action + reward.

Throw the ball again, and she will look up at the ball, and not go for it, instead staring at my hand where she expects a treat. It's not like this is the first time I've tried to do this - it happens very often, where she will stop doing the trick once I give her a treat.

It seems like pretty basic dog functioning that upon a reward for a behavior, the dog will continue to do that behavior for the reward. It doesn't seem like my dog picks up on that idea, though. Any help?

431,[help] my dog went balistic when she saw another dog,dogs,t3_a8yq6k,1,False,False,a8yq6k,"Story:

So I've had my dog for several years now and I feel she's very well trained if not a bit stubborn at times (which personally I like, she knows when I'm serious about a command and knows when she can pout) and is very kind and gentle to everyone she's met- however recently she's been basically throwing a fit when she sees another dog outside the window which results in her ""weeping"" (whining + small barks resulting in a weep weep sound) and running around the house. I believed this was just excitement cause there was another dog outside the house and maybe it's territorial maybe she wants to meet the other dog outside but yesterday I took her on a walk at a park where you're SUPPOSED to have a leash on your dog but of course someone didn't and so this little jack russel looking dog runs over and starts jumping around before being called back. My dog has encountered this before and usually just tries to play and jump too but this time she absolutely freaking lost it, whipping around in the leash pulling harder than she's ever pulled, and basically screaming (that bark+whine thing)

Problem:

Now obviously she was extremely excited and wanted to play however I have a intense fear of letting my dog play with other dogs just randomly because she's not a small dog and could do some damage but at the same time she's not a big dog and could be dealt some damage- I want to take her to a doggy daycare center to socialize her more with other dogs but I'm terrified that she's either going to hurt or be hurt since previous attempts to have her play with a dog have resulted in her acting very afraid regardless of the size of the dog and even one time snapping at the other dog in a warning type of way.

Tl;dr

Dog is socially inept when it comes to other dogs and had begun freaking out big time when she sees another dog. I want to socialize her with other dogs but I'm scared (due to helicopter parent and previous experiences) that she will get hurt or hurt some other dog. What's the best way to help her learn 1) not to freak out when seeing another dog 2) relax more around/be not socially inept with other dogs"
432,"[Help] well, the behavior came to a head yesterday, in probably the worst way possible.",dogs,t3_a8yjkw,7,False,False,a8yjkw,"As I’ve posted about recently my dogs behavior has drastically changed over the course of the last month.. this is due to me moving a lot, and a schedule change, so I’m sure she is a bit confused and just wants to be comfortable. Well yesterday she had the worst day she’s ever had. I hope it was just one bad day, but her recent behavior makes it seem like she’s constantly in defense mode. 

Basically what happened; my roomate and I, and his niece were outside playing with my dog, off leash, as we were playing fetch. She was being her normal self, just playing fetch, exerting a ton of what I’m sure is pent up energy, when his other niece lets her dog out of the house, it’s a little spaniel looking dog, even though we told her specifically not to. at first my dog completely ignored him or maybe just didn’t even notice him. Well, as soon as she noticed him, she darts straight at him, he immediately gets scared (of course, my dog is 100 + pounds, I’d be scared too) and snaps at her as she goes to sniff his butt. She snapped, grabbed this poor dogs mouth and that was that. He didn’t die, thank god, thank god she didn’t grab his neck or throat, I ran over and wrapped around my dogs neck, she immediately let go, though I did have to hold her down. He just got stitched up and seemed okay even after the incident. 

As for my dog, I took her to the vet right after because she has never showed that display of “aggression”. I’m just kind of at a loss because I don’t know if it was true aggression or if because she’s been defensive if it was reactive. She was sort of in this mode when I took her to the vet, but obviously completely fine when being handled by the vet. 

After the vet I took her to where she grew up and where my friends still had their dogs, she was completely fine with them just like always, they literally gang up on her, bite her and hump her, literally doesn’t care at all, doesn’t do anything but play with them. Then took her to my dads where there’s another dog that’s kinda like her mom. She was a little stand offish with my dads dog, but to be fair his dogs kind of a bully. 
 
After talking to my vet and explaining how she was vs how she’s been lately, I think it came down to this; as a puppy and even up till like 3/4 months ago, she was very submissive, I’m talking she’s the dog that lays down if another dog is any sort of vocal or tries to be dominate. Almost like a person fed up with being bullied my vets guess was she realized that standing her ground is better than letting other dogs be the boss. This is magnified by the fact I just moved, she’s not comfortable there yet and she has anxiety. I think this comes down to anxiety, and lack of exercise( I work a lot more than I used too ) = her lashing out. 

My thing is, I don’t trust her now. I don’t trust her to go to a dog park and enjoy herself anymore, because she seems like she’ll react to anything badly. This is a dog I’ve taken to off leash parks since she was 10 weeks old, and now I can’t. I’m not putting her or any other dog in that situation. I guess my question is does anyone have any advice on how to get back to the point of letting her run with other dogs  without worrying? Do I just go for it and show confidence when I go there that I believe in her, and that this just happened by circumstance? Do I take her but muzzle her? Again this is a dog that was sooo submissive to other dogs not even 2 months ago. And if you’ve been in this situation please let me know. I love her, I know going to the park and running makes her sooo happy and I don’t want to take that from her. "

I've cooked his food, etc. But it always comes back. The vet said the next step would to be ultrasounds to look for tumors or something else... but I'm wondering if it is worth it at this point... which sounds awful I know. But as frustrating as this is for us, I know it is so much worse for him. He doesn't want to poop on the floor. He doesn't want to need to go out urgently every couple of hours. It probably is painful. I know all of that. But other than this issue, he is pretty ok and that is what makes it so hard. I thought the decision, when the time came, would be more clear. I didn't think I would feel like I was doing it for selfish reasons (not wanting my home filled with diarrhea and not wanting to spend thousands more). I'm so torn. I know he's not as happy as he used to be... but it's not like he's unable to move or go for walks etc. I also know the decision is mine and no one can make it for me. But... some advice and shared experience would be appreciated. Sorry for the long message and any typos... writing this with tears streaming down my face. My boy... my good, good boy. "

440,[help] isolation distress - undoing my behaviour,dogs,t3_a8u7zd,3,False,False,a8u7zd,"Hi. I have a 3yr old staffy that is very friendly and loving. I've had her 2 weeks and in that time it's been a bit of a ride.

1st week I increasingly left her alone because I had work. She seemed ok although peed and pooped 2 times during the night. After the 2nd time I made her sleep in a crate, which she seemed happy with (lots of snoring).

2nd week is the start of time off work, and this is where I think I've messed up. Initially just gradually increased time together. Got her groomed, going to the vets, walks, training (got her to understand a clicker, whistle, and get to stay, kinda). However, I started noticing she would sit at the door and stay there when I left the house (my heart sunk when I saw this). I put a camera in the house and I noticed she'd pace around the house looking for me, staring out the window, sitting at doors, some whining, rarely settling down and now peeing on the carpet. I thought wildlife videos on the tv would help, not really.

I've started to desensitize her by opening the door whilst she's there and not. The door handle seems to kick off her whole panic. I thought it was my keys. She's gone from running to the door (on door noise) to sitting up in the sofa. I'm doing this a lot listening for her reaction and then making myself present (by sounds). I've also stopped getting her out of the crate when I get out of bed, I do something else, ignore her, then come back a few minutes later once she's settled down. I'm also reigning in my affection and acknowledging her i.e trying to get me to give her belly rubs .

Thankfully, she is mostly calm by herself when I'm in the house, even if I'm silent. It's the act of leaving the house (by the rear door, not front I've noticed). She's almost an angel when on walks.

This is mostly just a dump of thoughts as I'm stressed out tbh. Hoping for a bit of support or tips. I've also just noticed I can hear her snoring whilst I've been upstairs in my room with her on the couch.

441,[Help] Large dogs as emotional support animals (flying),dogs,t3_a90ere,5,False,False,a90ere,"Does anyone have any experience with large dogs (90+ lbs) as emotional support animals, specifically flying with them? How does this work if the dog is too large for a carrier/too large to fit under your seat, or is too large to fit sitting in front of one single seat? Do I have to buy her a seat? I have a large (100lb) dog I have registered as an emotional support animal, but I have no idea the logistics of flying with her. Airlines all have pretty vague policies, so hoping someone here has actual experience! Thank you :)

442,[Help] What should be done about a dog that keeps biting people?,dogs,t3_a8rv9l,8,False,False,a8rv9l,"So this isn't about my dog, but my friend's families'. A few days ago I went over to his house, and when I walked through the door the dog immediately went crazy barking at me. So his mom calms the dog down and I don't think much of it. I've been barked at by many dogs, whatever. So later in the night I walk upstairs to grab some stuff, and I open a door coming up from the basement. Immediately this dog jumps up from its bed and starts barking and running at me. I jumped back a little and kind of got in a defensive position as I had never met this dog and didn't know anything about it. The dog bites into my leg, and I start bleeding pretty good with a nice puncture wound. Luckily his mom got the dog away from me and put it in another room. I later learned I'm the third person bit by this dog, including someone who had come to paint the house. This post is mostly just me being curious, as I don't intend to sue them or anything,  but what should they be doing/what are they doing wrong? It seems to me like they shouldn't just let a dog walk around that has already bit 3 people, and taken a pretty good chunk out of me for seemingly no good reason. Thanks in advance"

My family has owned three dogs, all Brittany (Spaniel)s. A few years ago we had to put the first one down. He lived a good 14 amazing years. Today, my best friend only lived to be 9. The last three weeks he has been slowly declining, cancer was spread throughout his body and his kidneys were failing. The last few days he has refused all food and was getting so weak, so he was sent to Heaven this morning...

Throughout this all, I’m so thankful of the memories that I have with him. I’ve never seen a dog with a personality like him, and there’s a giant hole on my life now. My best friend is gone, and I feel angry with myself. Being at college, I can’t see him as much as I used to be able to. I wish I could’ve been there more for him, taking him on walks and giving him good boy belly rubs. It’s never easy. I wish I could give him one last hug and kiss, and it kills me knowing that I can’t do that. I just pray and hope he knows that I love him so much and that he loves me too. 😭"
444,[Help] Shoes for a senior dog who is slipping on hardwood,dogs,t3_a8tbr1,13,False,False,a8tbr1,"Our little guy (11 year old, 6 lb, Chihuahua Terrier) went through a few weeks of refusing food while adjusting to a medication 1-1.5 years ago and lost a lot of muscle mass in his back legs.  Since then, he’s able to walk easily on carpeted surfaces but we have hardwood in the kitchen, for example, that he clearly slips around on.  His back feet start to migrate out, like Bambi on ice.  He doesn’t whine or anything, but I can’t imagine it 1. Feels very good or 2. Is good for him long term. But he has **always** loved being in the kitchen with us and seems truly happy, I honestly feel it would affect his happiness if I, say, gated him off to only carpet.  Has anyone ever had “shoes” for a little guy like him? I see lots of shoes for outdoor use but they look a little bulky and seem like something that wouldn’t be really very appropriate for indoor use. If those are the only option, I’ll try them, but wondered if anyone who has had experience with senior dogs with similar leg problems might have a recommendation. The only obstacle other than finding them is actually getting him to *wear* them. He can be fussy, but I wonder if he’ll realize they help him? Any help/suggestions greatly appreciated!"

452,"[Help] advice for ""rescuing"" neighbor's neglected German Shepherd",dogs,t3_a8pfxl,9,False,False,a8pfxl,"I've been renting at this house for a year and half, and there have been dogs next door.  No one has lived there, and someone is squatting now (possibly a relative, but there's no power).  Recently the city cleared (scraped) out trash from the backyard, including cars and boats, a full meat freezer, tires, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I've started feeding the one German Shepherd that is left.  I saw him digging through trash one day and couldn't take it.  The way he looks and how he has been eating the past few days i'm sure they're not feeding him.  I did see someone drop a styrofoam takeout box in the paint shed where he stays occasionally.  He doesn't see very well, he's very skittish with sounds, and wary of people.

The family i live with has had some stand-offish conversations with the owner of the house, in the past.  We are a white family in a mostly black neighborhood, and they've been resentful when we suggest they change things.  For example, in response to complaints about smells, rats, and mosquitoes, they said ""no one uses their backyard around here"".  Not to mention concerns about the dog getting out, which it does all the time.

453,[Vent] My neighbor sucks.,dogs,t3_a8cn91,1,False,False,a8cn91,"My neighbor has a pitbull.  She's a very very sweet girl and very loving.  She's horribly neglected though.  I offered to purchase her for 250 dollars, planning on rehoming her, but he refused.  She's on a 10 ft length of chain and no one ever plays with her, or pets her aside from me.  Our yards are not fenced and we're very close together.  My dog Lulu and Skye (the Pit) play all day if I leave Lu out.

Often, they forget to feed Skye.  I know, because -I- feed her and put her bowl in a specific place, upside down so I know if it's been moved at all.  They always feed her in the same place so if the bowl's moved, I know they've fed her.   They often don't fill her water bowl.  I do.

She had no shelter, no house.  I got a dog house and helped her learn to use it by giving her treats in the dog house.  I make sure she gets a little love, but it's hard because she's so desperate for attention and love that when I get close, she jumps all over me and scratches the fuck out of me, even in long sleeves and pants.  Her nails need to be cut, badly.I'm trying to save to buy a house with a  yard, and if I do, I'm going to simply take her and leave.  People say to call animal control, but they won't do anything because she has shelter now, and food, even though it's cause of me.  If they did take her, she'd be labeled aggressive because she's a pit and all of them in the parish are.  I've called pit rescues, and none will take her because the owner will refuse to surrender her, and because if I steal her and they take her, they can lose their non profit status.   I've been searching for a home for her, but no one wants pits and the one shelter who would take her, even if I took her, said they won't take her in because 'pits don't move'.

&amp;#x200B;

I also am afraid to start crap between the neighbor and me, which could result in him moving Skye to a place I can't get to her to help her, or worse.  I'm afraid my own dog would get hurt. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I woke up at three and heard a dog crying, and assumed it was Skye who has a very baby sounding bark.  It was about 3 am.  She was okay, so I went back to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got up at 7, I realized they had a tiny pit puppy in a carrier outside in the 45 degree weather and she was covered in shit and dog food and pee.  I brought her inside and bathed her, then let her play on my floor for about an hour. I fed her and gave her water and then wrapped her in an old towel and put her back.  They finally came out to get her at about 11.45.

&amp;#x200B;

If she's there in the morning, I'm taking her and bringing her to the shelter.  She's a tiny, beautiful puppy and someone will take her home.

458,[Breeds] For funsies with potential to be an actual thing,dogs,t3_a8l4lt,36,False,False,a8l4lt,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first. I've trained Cairns, a terrier mix, a dachshund, and two Standard Poodles. Quantity-wise I have a dog prepared to take his TKA test. Quality-wise all of my dogs have had great manners and enough basics to make them wonderful companions. 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Breeder, but am keeping an eye on some rescues. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Smaller than what I currently have. Trainable, but doesn't necessarily have to be the most trainable or biddable. Either less active and cuddly or more independent if more active. Good around children. Playful. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My random list of possibilities somewhat in an order: Cairn, Boston, Bichon, Miniature Poodle, Papillon, Miniature Schnauzer, Maltese, Yorkie, French Bulldog. But I'm definitely open to other options. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* CGC, Trick Dog, and then I'd try whatever else seems to fit the dog. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 10-20 minutes of training daily with 30-60 minute sessions once or twice a week. Interactions and play would be on and off while I'm home. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30-45 minute walks daily alternating between training walks (usually on the shorter end), sniffy walks (usually on the longer, and long line walks (a mix of sniffy and distance training). Playground workouts are also a big hit with my current dogs and would be something I continue. A lot of big moment tricks if possible (Louis loves his daily push ups). No dog park, but we'd occasional visits to my parents' house to play in their yard with their dog(s). 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm fine with whatever - especially with a smaller dog. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* &lt; 25lbs, but there's some wiggle room.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Preference is very little shedding. But could handle a smaller shedder. Barking is fine. Not a fan of slobber. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I'm fine with either. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A little bit of both would be great, but would lean towards eager-to-please. However, I'd also be fine with ""able to be motivated with food/toys/games/etc"" 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Bark with a knock. Indifferent to happy when they enter/meet.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Leash reactive? Yes. General DA? No.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* n/a

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 3-4 hours at first and then eventually 8-9 hours

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Louis and Owen would love a short sibling. [They have many short friends](https://i.imgur.com/oqYCtsg.jpg) 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Louis and Owen, 2 and 1 year old Standard Poodles. Other than tank pets, that's about it. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes 

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No bans

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Hot, humid summers and mild-cold winters with some bitter days interspersed. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Once I went to a dog show to inquire about dachshunds and ended up with information for a Cairn breeder. My mind is easily changed. But I also know my limits; Dachshund to Cairn is one thing, smaller dog with me on the fence about shedding to Golden Retriever isn't going to happen.

460,[Discussion] Dog looks uncomfortable during group play at kennel.,dogs,t3_a8seu6,4,False,False,a8seu6,"Dropped my 9 mo. pup at the kennel yesterday as I will be away for the holidays. She's only ever socialized with other dogs while on a leash, and she has always been jumpy and over-excited when she sees them. The boarding service offered to help socialize her a little more with group play sessions with other dogs. I said yes because they're a really great place and I trust their staff.

I'm watching her group sessions through the webcam and she seems so uncomfortable. The rooms starts with a few dogs and builds up to about 30 dogs. The whole time she's kind of off by herself, walking around alone, or standing by the door. Yesterday she seemed okay with other dogs coming near her, didn't really engage much though. Sniffed a few butts but otherwise kept to herself. Today she seemed to walk around a bit more but when I checked in again near the end she was very obviously dodging dogs that came close to her. 

I know that the staff wont let anything dangerous happen, but from a personality perspective what does this mean? I really thought she'd enjoy these sessions because she seems to want to play with dogs when we're out for a walk, and usually she's the one that ends up getting too up in their faces with her puppy excitement. She seems like a brand new dog here.

Her tail isn't tucked but you can tell that she gets (happier?) when she's near the trainer and by the door because her tail will pop up and start wagging. Why is she more comfortable seeing dogs on leash but scared off leash? Isn't it usually the other way around? "
461,[Help] Four year old dog still acts like a puppy,dogs,t3_a8pvds,15,False,False,a8pvds,"I've had my dog for three years now and I've kept hoping and kept hoping that she would calm down with age, but she hasn't. I walk her for an hour every other day and thirty minutes the in between days. She plays with toys, eats a lot of food. Has my girlfriend's dog to play with on the weekends. All of this but she is so stinking hyper. Whenever we go on walks she will want to just take off sprinting every ten seconds, so she won't stop tugging on the leash. She chews up anything she can find if I try to leave her out of her cage while I leave. This has led to me having to crate her one hundred percent of the time I'm not with her. When I bring her over my girlfriend's house with hardwood, I cannot leave her out to walk around because she just runs and slides everywhere so she is either outside or in a crate. She basically won't move anywhere without running if she can't help it (i.e. on a leash).

I've considered hiring a trainer because I do not know how to do it. Any ideas on where I can start trying to be a better dog owner and make my dog happier and less confined all the time?"
462,"[HELP] brought senior dog home today, immediately had to return him. feeling so shattered and guilty.",dogs,t3_a8qv8v,15,False,False,a8qv8v,"So, we've been waiting a month to bring this 11 year old male puggle in to our home. We were so excited. His owners assured us he loved dogs, has never had any bad history with dogs, and was just a generally well behaved and great dog. We did have a meet a greet where him and my 5 year old female puggle got along reasonably well - nothing super concerning and nothing that prepared me for today. I now know he was on a sedative during that meeting - another story for another time.

He was dropped off and after spending one on one time outside with him, I had my mom go get our female so we could take them for a nice walk together. The male immediately started doing what I like to call a ""beagle scream"" when he saw my girl. He grabbed everything he could off the street, including poop, had a master grip, and growled and held on to my finger when I tried to remove food from his mouth. I had to ask my mother for help getting him to release me. Also showed teeth to my girl a few times.

Long story short(ish), we got them both back home and he was a bit of a terror. Screaming unless someone was petting him and getting angry when my girl came in for pets. As he was being vocal and grumpy, my girl was respecting his space when all of a sudden he snapped and tried to bite her right in her face - I've worked with 80+ dogs at once and have developed very quick reaction skills, so I managed to prevent any harmful contact. I know that spats are comment during the adjustment period, but after he snapped things just spiraled and both the dogs were freaking out being completely unfriendly and he even growled at me while we were alone in my room together (after spat, figured we would separate and reintroduce on another walk) when I stopped petting him. All of it was just too much and I knew deep down it was not the right fit nor was it something I could handle long term.

I called M, said it was not the right match for the dogs. M became very rude and angry with me, saying she would not come get him - I told her the environment was not ideal for us or the dogs and that I would be bringing him to her home for her to collect. She said I was greatly inconveniencing her, I apologized. When we got there (my mom and I) she refused to look us in the eye or even turn her body towards us and slammed the door in my mother's face as she tried to explain and apologize.

463,[Discussion] Has anyone ever adopted a dog before meeting it? Or driven out of state to adopt a dog?,dogs,t3_a8s8z3,14,False,False,a8s8z3,"This could apply to dogs from breeders, as well. 

I understand why rescues want to send dogs to different states if they believe it's going to get a better chance of finder a good family. The group I volunteered for had dogs all the way from Puerto Rico and if a dog had to be returned for whatever reason, it would stay with a foster in-state. 

My only concern is adopting the dog you won't get to meet until after you adopted it. What happens if something unfortunately happened and things don't work out? Does the dog get transported back to it's original rescue or does it stay with a foster? 

Also, would you ever adopt a dog from somewhere outside of your own state? Would it be worthwhile to widen our net? I seem to have better luck finding compatible dogs out-of-state, but my family is worried about something not working out and the driving distance. "

466,[Breeds] Help us choose our future dog!,dogs,t3_a8q4pe,12,False,False,a8q4pe,"**Introduction**

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, my partner and I have both grown up with and still have family dogs (his family has had five different dogs and three for me). But this will be the first dog we own independently.

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Either, I've been struggling with the ethics of breeding but for our ideal dog I am open. 

Describe your ideal dog.

* Friendly, we don't need a guard dog (but don't mind if they think they are) and we would like to have children and other dogs in the future. We love the mixture of cuddly and playful dogs who want some down time but also enjoy playing fetch. Prefer someone trainable (the smarter the better) and we are not fans of barkers. 

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Shar-pei, French Bulldog (we love French Pitbulls or French Staffies)- size, cuteness
* Great Dane (not right now), Lab, Cane Corso- we love big dogs, but they're unrealistic right now. We've both owned labs and loved them (personality, intelligence, playfulness, etc...)

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience/manners, fetch. Beyond that, tricks would be awesome but not required!

**Care Commitments**

How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 20+ minutes of training daily plus 30-60 minute sessions once or twice a week as a puppy
* 20-60 minutes of play, walk, exercise daily
* Lots of interacting and hanging out :)

How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* 20-60 daily minutes of walk/exercise, fetch, tug of war, and dog parks are our exercises of choice. If a dog can swim, even better! (We are willing to dedicate up to 60ish minutes for the right companion, the 20-60 is our willing activity time daily) 

How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We don't mind brushing weekly but much more than that we aren't too interested in. No problem bringing a dog for haircuts but not every week. We are willing to clean ears, brush teeth, and things like that if the dog requires it.

**Personal Preferences**

What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium size (possibly small/medium but not tiny)- My partner plays basketball professionally abroad for 8 months a year. This means we will travel via airplane at least twice a year with the dog (probably not more) and so we are looking for one that this would be reasonable for. We don't mind a medium size dog since it would only be twice a year but nothing large right now. 

How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* We could handle a small amount of shedding but would prefer less or none, minimal slobber and minimal barking.

How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* That would be ideal

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly or in the middle, but we love a good snuggle.

Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A bit of both, but an eager-to-please dog would be fun.

How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* No barking, and visitors shouldn't feel afraid of our dog. We don't mind if they're skeptical but friendly would be fine. We also of course don't mind if the dog barks in an extreme or overly exciting situation.

Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, we would like a dog-friendly dog and plan on getting at least a second dog when we settle down.

Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Constant ""Yippers"" are a no

**Lifestyle**

How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 4 hours at first and then possibly a days work maximum but I currently work from home anyways.

What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* N/A

Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* None currently, but we would like more down the line. Since they will be the first one living with us and having the house to their self, we don't want them to be too territorial (we have also found in our research that certain breeds can be socialized to avoid this trait).

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Eventually but not as a puppy

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We will be renting in the future but we don't know of any breed or weight restrictions and are willing to work to find rentals that will accommodate our dog

What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Barcelona, Spain currently, there are restrictions that just require registration/licensing and lead laws. (Off-season/summer in New England- no restrictions)

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Mild winters in Europe, hot summers in New England (we have the potential to go anywhere in the world for my partner's work so we would prefer a dog that is adaptable to weather)

He has been with us for about 8 months and has always been great at the dog park and loves going and running with the other pups. Today, however, he was around a cluster of dogs when a couple dogs started picking on a berenese mountain dog puppy (maybe 6 months old). Remi got a bit excited when this happened and jumped into the fray and started chasing the pup. He then pinned her down and had her neck in his mouth while she was whimpering. 
I rushed over and grabbed him by the collar. He didn't really resist this. The pup is completely fine but I felt awful. He has never done anything like this before. We left immediately after and Remi didn't act like anything was wrong.

469,[Help] Dog suddenly sleeping with me,dogs,t3_a8kdf9,10,False,False,a8kdf9,"My dog is a 4.5 Year old pit mix and I’ve had her for 4 of those. She’s never been one to sleep with me. When I first got her she’d start out on my bed but eventually move and go somewhere else. For the last three years the routine has always been I go to bed and she stays on the couch. She’s always been welcome on my bed but she’s always preferred to come stand by my bed until I get up. 

There has been a big change for me in terms of jobs which is going to require a lot more travel and she’ll be staying with my parents at those times (they’ve always kept her for me and it’s like a second home for her that she loves) but I haven’t started traveling yet. But that will begin in about a month. However starting this last week when I’m not traveling I’m working from home so I have been home more. 

Anyways a couple of weeks ago I had a bad cold and spent a couple days in bed and that’s when she’d start getting in my bed to sleep around 3/4am and now she does this nightly. I’m ok with it but I’ve just noticed she seems more cuddly and seems to follow me around more.  She’s also started getting on the bed more during the day. 
This week while I’ve been working from home she seemed to need more attention than normal and was following me around a ton. I should add prior to my position change I would work from home some days and that never seemed to throw off our routine - I just do it daily now. She normally is the type of dog that just goes and does her own thing and isn’t one to be underfoot.  Usually when I work from home she spends most of the day in the backyard sunning herself and just checks in periodically. 

Her appetite is still good and we go on daily walks and her energy level seems the same and she doesn’t seem ill but her sudden desire to be more cuddly and have more attention have me slightly concerned. I’m not opposed to it - and I’ve enjoyed our morning cuddles I’m just concerned I’m possibly missing something."

472,[help] Dog goes to sleep right after stress/fear?,dogs,t3_a8raiy,3,False,False,a8raiy,"Hey r/dogs!

This is my first post. I just adopted my first puppy a couple a days ago. She's a 9 week old boxer mix. She sleeps a ton which I know is normal for a pup. When she's awake she loves to play and seems to be a very happy pup. 

Yesterday, I took her to the vet to give her a new-adoption check up. Of course, with all the other dogs there she got a little worried but was still calm and observant. When it was time for us to see the vet, we put her on the table and she seemed sleepy out of no where. She just laid down and got all ""soft"". This worried me and the vet said she was concerned if she continues to be this lethargic. She gave us some antibiotics and pain meds for her recent spaying and asked us to collect a stool sample for her because I mentioned her stool is somewhat soft. 

Here's the weird thing, as soon as I got her home, she was normal and playful. 

Today, she's been her normal self. She ran around and played a lot. Until I had to give her the medicine. She did not do well with it, and spat it out with every trick in the book. So I ended up having to manually give her the pill by placing it on the back of her tongue so she would swallow it. Immediately after, she walked away from me, laid down, and went took a nap.

Thank you in advance!"
473,"[Help] dog beyond terrified of baths, pooped out of fear",dogs,t3_a8r6ls,6,False,False,a8r6ls,"My 75 pound dog has been terrified of baths since he was young, and he’s now 5. I read online about putting treats in the bathroom and then in the tub but that doesn’t work; he will just stand by the door and bark for the treats (steak) all night. He gets so scared during the bathing process that he will ignore food, even his favorite (peanut butter).

Since bathing him in the tub was a nightmare we tried bathing him outside and that worked a bit better but still was horrible and also only works in warm weather.

Then we started bringing him to a self-service dog grooming station. It takes two of us with one person holding him and he tries to escape and shakes the whole time. It’s so sad and brutal. I was pregnant so we couldn’t bath him for like a year since I didn’t want to get injured and now we have a baby so taking him to the self service station isn’t going to happen, not to mention last time we did it was the worst time yet since he now recognizes the parking lot and starts freaking out and trying to escape before we even go inside. 

I asked the vet for anti anxiety meds and we tried to bathe him in our bath tub today but the meds didn’t work. He actually pooped out of fear and we actually never got him in the tub at all. My husband tried to pick him up but he made himself really heavy and kept trying to wriggle away. Then he pooped and we gave up and bathed him with a wet towel, which also terrified him.

Can anyone offer any advice? I’ve tried reading things on the internet but nothing I’ve tried has worked. Of course I don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on baths but I would if anyone knows of any trainers who specialize in baths or bathing companies that work with dogs who hate baths. He was really dirty this last time and it unfortunately results in less pets for him because I hate my hand coming away all brown and greasy. "

476,My dog was attacked and killed by a neighbor's dog [vent],dogs,t3_a8hfhr,34,False,False,a8hfhr,"Ever since I could speak, I've always wanted a puppy/dog and I begged my mom for one incessantly. She always said no but I guess finally caved since she saw how badly I wanted one. My wish came true one Friday when my mother stepped through the door at 10 pm after dog-searching the entire day. She had a small, white and brown, shih tzu-maltese mix in her arms and I was ecstatic. We were attached at the hip since and I played with him everyday. I remember on bad days where I would be in my room crying and he would hear my sobs through the bedroom door, burst in and lick me to death.

&amp;#x200B;

Today at around 11:30 or so, my mom went to go walk him. I usually walk him up the street of our neighborhood because he has some favorite spots there but since my Mom was walking him, she took him downstreet instead. According to my mother's account, she was mere blocks away from bringing my dog home when she saw a young woman open her front door. A large pitbull burst through and quickly sprinted up to my mom and my dog. He bit into his neck and proceeded to maul him as bystanders got out of their cars and tried to help get the pitbull off of him by beating it with a bat or prying its jaws open. Nothing worked.

My mom came home and told me the news and I was in shock. I could hardly register it but once I did I began bawling. My mom drove me down to the neighborhood where it happened and as we were entering the neighborhood, the police were just leaving. They took my dog's body and the pitbull who attacked him. I've been told the pitbull will be euthanized but I'm not sure.

When I arrived, the young woman, who I presume is the owner apologized to me and a man that was standing with her tried to justify it as a ""dog fight"" despite it hardly being a fight. A pitbull randomly attacked my dog and according to witnesses and my mother, my dog just couldn't put up a fight. He didn't stand a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's about 10 hours later and everything seems to be back to normal which is jarring to me. Nobody seems affected by the fact that our dog was killed but me. My brother briefly showed emotion, slamming his fist on the railing when my mom told him what happened but shortly after reverted back to playing video games from morning to night as usual. My dad came home and gave my a hug to comfort me but is watching TV now, like normal. My mom refuses to take any legal action to hold the pitbull owners accountable for what happened. This confuses me because my mom speculates that this was an act of sabotage and that she has been watching us peacefully walk our dog for a long time and set her dog out on ours on purpose....but yet won't hold them responsible for it. This event by all accounts has been swept swiftly under the rug. My mother even offered to buy a new dog of the same breed and gender and name him the same name but I swiftly denied the offer.

I feel like I need closure somehow. I wanted my dog's body so I could atleast bury him close to home but I don't know where they took him. I want the owner to be held accountable for what she did but my mom won't take legal action and her account is the only one that holds any real weight because she was actually there.

I'm just incredibly confused and torn. My dog was an old dog so he was calm and sweet. I've always imagined he would die of old age in his home, surrounded by people who love him so the thought of his final moments on earth being that of suffering tears me apart. I didn't get to say goodbye to him. It hurts me to know that I'll never see him again. I really could use words of comfort and advice on how to move forward right now..

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes, this will be our first dog.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We would prefer a rescue.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

We are a family with young children - ages 5 and 7 - so a child-friendly dog is a must.  We would like a medium energy dog who enjoys playtime but is also able to calm down and enjoy hanging around the house with the family.  We would also prefer a dog that doesn't shed or slobber a lot, however this is negotiable.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We were originally interested in golden retrievers and labs because of their reputation for being family-friendly dogs, however we are open to any breed/type.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

We would like a dog that can easily be walked on a leash and can follow basic commands.

**Care Commitments**

1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

My husband works from home, so although he will need to be working he is okay with having the dog around throughout the day.  In the evening, I am fine with taking time to walk the dog and play with it.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

We have a medium sized fenced-in backyard that the dog will have access to, as well as 1-2 walks per day.  We are okay with occasionally taking visits to a dog park as well.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We don't have much experience with dog grooming, but are willing to try to learn to do it at home.

**Personal Preferences**

1. What size dog are you looking for?

We are unsure on what the perfect size dog would be for our family. It's not a huge factor for us.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I do not want a dog that is constantly barking.  I would prefer to not have to deal with a large amount of shedding and slobber, but that is less important to me than the barking.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

This is not something that we consider largely important.  It would be nice, however our yard is fenced so the times when this would be necessary are minimal.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

We would like a dog that enjoys snuggling but is also fine with doing its own thing.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

An eager to please dog would be good for the children, however we are also fine if the dog is slightly independent.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

We do not want a dog that is going to bark at or be aggressive toward house guests.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, we do not want a dog that is aggressive in any way.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

The biggest factor is finding a dog that will not be aggressive towards the children.

**Lifestyle**

1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

My husband works from home, so the dog will not be left alone for long hours.  However, he will be working and won't be able to be playing with the dog during that time, so the dog will have to be able to be independent enough to tolerate that.  On the weekends, the dog may be left alone for a few hours (3-4) occasionally.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

No one in the family has owned a dog before.  Both adults are willing to be equally involved in caring for the dog, but we are looking for a dog that is good for a first-time owner.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No, we do not plan on having other pets.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, we have two boys ages 5 and 7.

482,[Breeds] Right dog for me?,dogs,t3_a8n0so,10,False,False,a8n0so,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* It will be the second family dog, we have had a black lab before.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescue or reputable breeder is fine.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* A dog that will motivate us to go out on decent 2-3 mile (at least) walks each day, but will calm down and enjoy being petted in the evening.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I'm interested in labradoodles and airedales because I like their ""scruffy"" look and their faces have character. Not necessary, though

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Sit, stay, paw, come over here, fetch, (basic commands), and maybe a simple trick.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I will be at school for most of the day and my parents will be at work, but we can devote time in mornings and afternoons.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* We can exercise the dog around 30 mins to 1 hour on a work day, and closer to 2 on a weekend

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We're willing to trim the dog and things like that every 1-2 months

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large size dog. But not too big, like great dane big. Preferably medium size.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* My mother was tired of the shedding when we had our old dog, so not too much shedding, barking is fine as long as it doesn't just bark randomly (barking when we get home is completely fine), and slobber should just be ""not too much"".

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Kind of important, but we wouldn't do it often anyway.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Definitely a snuggly boi

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* If someone was knocking on door it'd be fine to bark. I'd like the dog to greet them kindly. But I'd not like it to be too friendly. It's funny, our old lab was so nice to visitors but when there were intruders the dog chased them away. Like a sense that someone is bad.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Our social circle has dogs, so no.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* A lot of shedding

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Around 6-8 hrs a day because of us being at work/school

* Our family has similar preferences, they will basically just be walking it and stuff.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We do not have any other pets.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Our social circle has children from ages 6-10 so we need it to be friendly with children.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Not sure what this is. We are not renting property, if that's what it means

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* United States, and I'm aware of the unfair rottweiler restrictions in some areas.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* In miami it can get anywhere from 50º at the very lowest to around 100º so the dog should be able to handle that (it will have access to shade and a pool, however.)

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Unfortunately, getting an older dog won't be an option for us, as we kind of want to raise the dog so we'd want a puppy (don't know if that's relevant but OK)

483,[HELP] When can my puppy go outside into the world?,dogs,t3_a8ox5g,14,False,False,a8ox5g,"I have been adviced by my vet that my Puppy should not go out due to the risk of getting ill without the right vaccination.

She was born on 13 Sept 2018.

She had to get first full vaccination and second on

19 Nov 2018: with Nobivac L4; Nobivac DHP and Nobivac KC for Dogs.

19 Dec 2018: with Nobivac L4; Nobivac DHP

&amp;#x200B;

Now the vet is saying to wait 1 more month for the third shots which I assume will be the KC for Dogs. Not sure.

My question is does it really take 3 months of vaccination to protect your dog from going out into the world, interacting with other dogs and so on?"
484,[Help] Dog has had diarrhea for 2 weeks...,dogs,t3_a8l4ia,14,False,False,a8l4ia,"First, let me say that she has been to the vet. She went last Saturday, had a fecal sample taken (also pooped everywhere after that) and the vet couldn't find anything wrong. He thinks it may be stress. We did have a baby 7 months ago but she's been fine up until now so I don't think that's it. We're going back to the vet xin an hour.

We have a 9 1/2 year old English bulldog. Shes always been quite healthy despite her breed, we've managed her diet and weight well and she's always had a cast iron stomach even after getting into the trash and litter box over the years. She does have food allergies including potatoes, barley, oats, venison, duck and eggs. Potatoes are her biggest one. I can't even remember any time that she's had diarrhea at all, let alone for a prolonged period.
Well, shes now had it on and off for over 2 weeks. We fed her boiled chicken and rice with canned pumpkin for a few days. She was at the vet last Saturday, was prescribed some meds (metrinadozole, fortiflora and one I cant remember) and started to seem better. She wasn't pooping as often but they were still soft. We reintroduced her food Thursday night (about 1/2 the usual amount mixed with white rice and pumpkin) and now she has it again. Shes been eating the food (natural balance lamb and rice) for months now with no issues. It started on a previous bag so I don't think we bought a bad one.
I know the vet said there wasn't anything apparent but there has to be something wrong for her to be this sick for so long. She's older....there has to be something. She's now peeing in the house too because she's been having poo accidents. 
Had anyone ever had this happen? We are going back to the vet today in an hour. Should I ask about prescription food? Should I ask about other tests? I don't know what to do....

Help please!

Update: Vet ran bloodwork and thinks its IBD. We're going to treat her for it and see if she improves at all by next Saturday. She's on prescription food for now. If she doesn't improve with steroids and the new food, he thinks it could be something else but we will take it one step at a time. "
485,[Help] My GSD (9moF) bit my husband today.,dogs,t3_a8ockm,17,False,False,a8ockm,"DH (32M) and I (30F) bought a GSD bitch 4 weeks ago from an elderly mother and daughter. When we came to pick her up, she hadn't been walked in a week. They really underestimated the time and energy a pup like her needs.




Anyway, we have 2 boys (8 &amp; 3) and she is incredible with them. Knows exactly how hard she can play with each of them and has the patience of a saint.




Unfortunately, she goes batsh*t insane at every passerby and every dog that wanders into her line of sight. Apparently, the older ladies that had her before never socialised her. But, we've been working with the local dog walkers to try and get her used to other people and dogs. So far, she's been doing really well; has taken a liking to a local Aussie Shep, and the older ladies in the group even loaned us a Thundershirt for her nerves :)




But we had an incident today. She was on her lead, playful but not overexcited, and an off-lead dog came straight up to her with no owner nearby. During the tussle, she got her teeth around something and went for it. Unfortunately, it was DH's hand. Not a bad bite, but enough to draw blood.




This is where I need some advice. What do?! She needs socialisation but she goes utterly nuts as soon as people move in an unpredictable way or if they even look at her. She has no tolerance for any other dogs (but ducks and cats are fine 🙃) She's just so nervous and scared of EVERYTHING.




How do I help her?

490,[help] dog is limping,dogs,t3_a8ndr4,0,False,False,a8ndr4,"Juliet, a 5 year old pit mix mix, has been favoring her back right leg for a week now. She has had limps before, I'd say once or twice a year on average in a 4 year span, that the vet diagnosed as a inflammation or a ligament issue.

I decided to wait and see if the limp would get any better before going to see the vet this time. She has shown signs of improvement but she still favors the back right leg. I'm going to taker her into the vet to make sure everything is ok.

494,[Vent] Sister's Inappropriate Treatment of the Dog,dogs,t3_a8ky0w,1,False,False,a8ky0w,"Background: I moved in and began renting from my dad and stepmom a year and a half ago in order to finish school. I have my own room, but due to family dynamics, I can't be completely independent, such as buying my own food and feeling like an actual tenant. As such, I've begrudgingly became involved when they bought a cockapoo puppy from a breeder shortly after I moved in. I didn't really want to become attached because I know how my family is with dogs.

The main reason we got Bo was because my younger half sister, who is 12, was desperate for a dog. Right off the bat there was no training invested in this puppy, and he still has regular accidents in the house (we got him 09/01/2017). My little sister became very attached and was convinced for awhile that Bo was her dog. That meant trying to change his name (tried calling him Bear, Bo-bo, or Bobby during that period where we were trying to teach Bo his name is Bo), wanting to involve him in everything (I have a picture of her taking a bath with the dog), and treating this poor dog like a baby. She would hold him like you would a human child and feed him treats or just carry him around. It's obvious Bo is obviously uncomfortable being cradled but my little sister thinks he's a toy? He has a relationship with her that's mainly reward driven, because my little sister is NOTORIOUS for feeding him from the dinner table. Every time I stand up from eating dinner, I can see her with a hand under the table letting Bo eat or lick from it. My parents don't really discipline her in this regard besides telling her no, which doesn't seem to mean much.

The biggest infraction is the way my sister touches Bo. Although I think I've shamed her enough from doing this because I haven't seen it recently, my little sister inappropriately pets Bo on his groin and genital area. Bo likes belly rubs, what dog doesn't? Except my sister takes this as it being okay to sort've finger and touch Bo on his penis. It is *incredibly* disturbing to see her do this. I'm not sure if this was intentional or if she did it absent-mindedly, because she seemed to pet this part of his body the same way as his ears or back, but maybe with some childish fascination. 

Regardless, she doesn't seem to understand the severity that it is not an appropriate place to touch the dog.  I am worried that this may have some impact on how the dog acts, especially around women. He reacts far differently when I come home vs. my brother or dad. When I go to pet him hello, he will be... physically excited (boner) and usually pees out of excitement. I don't know if these problems are related. I've tried to control him by making him wait before I pet him, but I am hardly home and worry about what else my little sister could be doing to him."
495,[Help] Almost 2 year old Yorkie Poo acting sluggish after vaccinations.,dogs,t3_a8oj4r,7,False,False,a8oj4r,"So, I posted yesterday for a sore on my dogs left front leg which he got prescribed some ointment for and while he was at the clinic today we got him up to date on his vaccines (DHPP + Lepto) around 0900 this AM.

Unfortunately the vet is closed now and he was acting perfectly fine when we got home and was being his old nuisance self like running off with tape while I was wrapping Christmas presents.

But over the past couple hours he’s just been acting very sluggish like depressed almost. He’s completely alert and all, but won’t eat any of his treats, and whimpers when I try to pick him up, so I’m guessing he’s kinda sore. Otherwise, was able to get him to take a few bites of bread earlier and a small bite of yogurt.

Meanwhile I’m gonna keep a very close eye on him or at least try calling the on call vet to see if they have anymore recommendations.

I will be introducing my rescue mutt (maybe red heeler/golden mix?) Jorah to the mix. Jorah is okay with other dogs when I'm not around such as at daycare, but seems to feel the need to protect me from most (not all) other dogs who come too close. My concern is that Lemmy and Jorah won't get along and we will have to keep them separated in the already pretty small house, which definitely isn't the ideal situation. My parents live on about half an acre, so the yard is nice and big. Lemmy and Lulah play together outside and I'd love to see Jorah added to the mix to have fun, too.

Jorah met Lulah and Lemmy on Thanksgiving when my parents came to visit in their RV. This happened in neutral territory. Lulah and Jorah were okay after an initial squabble. Lemmy and Jorah continued to snap and snarl at each other for most of the visit (the dobies stayed in the RV and Jorah stayed at my house). There were a couple of times that Jorah and Lemmy had good proximity and they were fine, which I hope means they will learn to get along and live together.

Só a lot has changed since my last pup.  Grain free was the responsible choice, especially Canadian-sourced foods like Acana and Origen.

I also want to avoid big brands that, I believe, skirt as close to as cheaply made as possible.  If GF is no longer safe that’s fine; I still don’t want to feed Purina or Hills which have all kinds of bullshit in their feed.

What are some good brands and solutions here?  My pup does have allergies to some of the fillers in food, so her current brand (a limited ingredient diet from Go!) has helped a ton with itching and biting herself.

She's a gremlin, the way she plays stresses out my timid and polite older dog. Demon growling and biting. My older dog is too shy and submissive to tell her no.

We recently went round Alfi's house with Roxy and they got on great, although Roxy did briefly guard a hoof that she found, growled at Alfi and Alfi backed off and left her alone until we could remove the hoof. No further problems occurred; they played a lot as they usually would when we meet at the local dog park, and both were pretty good at communicating ""dude, calm down"" when the other wanted to play and they didn't.

However, we figure things might be trickier in our own home. We've had a few other dogs briefly in the house and Roxy tends to get very stressed and reactive. I feel this will be better with Alfi, but is there anything we can do to make it easier? E.g., have Alfi explore our house when Roxy isn't there, etc. (And the ""obvious"", like remove any items that Roxy might guard, no feeding in the same room, give both places to go if they need space/rest.)

For the record, the long term idea is that we might be able to dogsit for each other, for various reasons. Thanks for any advice!"

On to my question: I was walking my dog with a friend, when I saw a person with a large dog walking towards us. I crossed the road and distracted my dog with treats to make sure she did't freak out. 

My friend suggested that crossing the street was rude, since the person might now think that I was avoiding them for some reason.

I train my puppy to go toilet using a puppy pee pads which I intend to move outside eventually. 

The success is that he uses the pads a lot more than he goes places he shouldn't. I think it's because of this spray I use on the pads to make them more attractive for him to use. I think the failure is because he is only using the pads because of the spray and not because of me training him correctly.

When ever he uses the pads I try to give him a treat and provide positive verbal reinforcement but when I try to go near him he moves away

We filled out an application and were in contact with the foster a few days later. We met him, he barked at us twice and came inside our house. We met him in our house which I think was part of the issue.

Prior to the meet we asked the foster how he was with strangers. We were assured he was timid at first but totally fine and loved to give kisses. Our biggest requirement was that he was good with people. My wife has had a bad experience in the past with a larger dog (big bite on the calf and scar) and wanted to make sure this aspect with strangers wouldn't trigger the dog. Since all this checked out she agreed to the adoption. 

Two weeks in and my sister in law comes over and the dog unleashes hackles, does a charge, and doesn't let her move from the wall. I am mortified, I can call him back no issue, but cant get him to stay. I finally crate him and do an oh-f@ck.

I contacted the foster and she tells me he did best starting in his crate and it was a ""better"" experience. ""Come again?""  Turns out the foster's husband was intimidated by the dog and so they deceived to get him placed. Had my wife known this she would have never agreed to adopt him. We wouldn't be in this situation at all. 

Add on that we told the foster we need a dog walker 2-3 days a week and were told it wouldn't be an issue. Now I am scared to leave him in the hands of a walker until he is more socialized with people. I've rearranged my work schedule to be home in the afternoon to let him out and walk him. He did fine in day care, but I can't do that 3 days a week.

All her fears have come to the surface and she is afraid to touch the dog. He didn't recognize her one evening and barked at her while running towards her and she broke down in tears. I have a great relationship with the pup and love him to pieces, but I can't do this to my wife. 

I travel for work from time to time and I don't feel comfortable leaving her with him. He senses her fear and becomes uncontrollable. I can work with the dog, but like I told my wife I can't give her a guarantee that he can fully diminish his fear of strangers. I've become the mediator.

I feel like a complete failure and sick to my stomach because I love that pup, but I love my wife even more and can't subject her to this. Now I don't know what to do. The foster won't take him back on account of her husband. The rescue has yet to respond. He is an amazing dog who would do well once socialized with people, but he needs someone who can guide him and isn't intimidated by him. 

I just need advice. I made a commitment to the pup, but I also have a commitment to my wife.

515,[Discussion] My 11 year old golden retriever's grain-free diet related heart problem is better after 6 months of heart meds and taurine supplements!,dogs,t3_a86iko,205,False,False,a86iko,"Long Post Warning, but I think it’s worth posting about and want to be thorough!

*Note: I’m using the veterinarian’s exact diagnosis throughout this post, as she would email me all her notes every time we would go for a checkup.*

TLDR: My 11 year old golden retriever was diagnosed with congestive heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which turned out to be due to her life long grain free diet and the critically low levels of taurine it caused. After six months of medication, taurine supplements and swapping her to dog food that is not grain free, she now has a healthy heart and is off all of her medication and supplements! And, she's got more pep in her step then she's had in at least a year!

Edit: spelling

Edit: thank you for the gold!

—

Our 11 year old golden retriever Lilly has been a happy and healthy gal her whole life,  say except for a rock swallowing incident when she was about 4 years old and a few bad earaches that turned out to be due to a thyroid problem that’s been managed by medication for a couple of years now.

These last 6 months, though, they have been pretty tough. After a few, what we thought were minor issues and a few vet visits, we were hoping we were yet again being overly cautious when we took Lilly back to the vet in June. She had been coughing, had lost a lot of weight even though she was eating (being picky but still eating, nonetheless) and just seemed off… Unfortunately, it turned out that we weren’t being overly cautious. Something was wrong and our vet wanted us to take Lilly to the local emergency/specialty clinic right away. We knew she had quite a bit of fluid around her heart, but by the end of the night the admitting ER vet was discussing everything from potential cancer to even putting her down. We decided the plan of action would be to drain the fluid and see what we were up against and go from there.

Here is the exact diagnosis from Lilly’s specialist, at the clinic:

*Based on today's evaluation, we have diagnosed Lilly with congestive heart failure secondary to a heart muscle disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM. In Lilly’s case, the degree of changes to the heart are severe, and congestive heart failure (retention of fluid) has developed. After diagnosis of heart failure due to this disease, the average survival is about 3 months, though some dogs do not respond well to therapy and some dogs live well for much longer times (even years).*

Three different medications (Lasix 50mg, Enalapril 10mg and Vetmedin 10mg)/ three pills, twice a day was what we were sent home with. That, and the best-worst-case scenario we could have got. It wasn’t cancer, and at least we could try to keep her feeling better, and pray for the best outcome. 3-6 months (which was average) left with her was not what we were wanting, but at least we wouldn’t have to put her down right away. We were going to enjoy whatever time we had left with her.

Next check up comes a few weeks later and this is where it gets interesting. (If you’ve hung in this long, keep going) Lilly had perked up and was doing well on her meds. Our doctor at the Specialty Clinic was pleased with how she’s doing, and we end up discussing Lilly’s diet- specifically if she was on a grain free diet. She was her whole life, up until about March 2018, and I only stopped the grain free diet because I thought she was getting picky in her old age, so I was trying anything to get her to eat… Here again is her specialist’s exact notes at this visit:

*Lilly’s case is very interesting in the fact that she has been on a grain free diet historically. As discussed today, there has been a trend in veterinary medicine with grain free diets and development of dilated cardiomyopathy, particularly in Golden Retrievers. Although the mechanism is not known as to why this is starting to occur, if low taurine is identified, supplementation with taurine would be recommended. With taurine deficiency related dilated cardiomyopathy, the prognosis may be improved with supplementation. We have sent taurine levels out today to investigate if supplementation is needed for Lilly.*

Here’s the thing- we had Lilly on a grain free diet because we thought that’s what we were “supposed” to do. Only the best for our girl, right? You’d have to be living under a rock to not see all of these grain-free pet food commercials. It seemed like the responsible thing a pet owner should do for their 4-legged companion, but after speaking with the specialist she suggested we stop feeding Lilly AND our other two year old golden retriever grain free food right away. She let me know that there’s not been any studies showing grain-free is any better than food with grain in it, and unless your dog has some sort of legit reason to not eat food with grain it in, there’s really no benefit from doing it.

When Lilly’s taurine level panel came back, it was pretty alarming. Normal range for a dog is 60-150 nmol/mL (whatever that means). Critical level is less than 40. Lilly was at a 15!

Specialist’s exact diagnosis:

*I am so happy to report that Lilly’s taurine levels came back at a critically low level, indicating that this may be the reason for the dilated cardiomyopathy. I would like to start supplementing her with 2000 mg twice daily of taurine and would like to recheck echocardiogram in 3 months. Typically in taurine-responsive DCM, we expect a generally longer prognosis than in idiopathic DCM and our best hope would be to able to reverse the cardiac changes and be able to wean the cardiac medications and just maintain on taurine. Lilly's grain-free diet has already been stopped (important as this has been recently implicated in possibly causing the taurine deficiency).*

6 pills in the morning and 6 pills in the evening, supplementing with taurine and taking 3 different medications for her heart.

Three months later Lilly went to her normal (amazing) vet, for her normal yearly check-up and things seemed pretty good! She was tolerating her meds well. We were happy. Normal vet was happy and after getting her check-up results, Specialist was happy. They told us to keep it up and we would check her again in 3 months.

Last week Lilly went in for that six month check up. I’m not going to lie, we were nervous. We had made peace knowing that if these test results did not come out the way we were hoping that we had 6 incredible months with Lilly, where we really got to love on her and learn from her, but we were praying for not just good results, but great results. Still, in the waiting room, I was nervous.

I couldn’t have possibly imagined how that visit would go, but miraculous is a great word to describe it! After 6 months of supplementing her with taurine and giving her the heart medications she wasn’t just doing good, she **is** doing great!!!

Her specialist’s exact diagnosis:

*We are beyond pleased to report that Lilly's echocardiogram is now normal, with the diet change, medications and taurine supplementation. Her cardiac ultrasound now shows a very normal heart. Therefore, we can discontinue her cardiac medications and taurine and continue her current diet. Her prognosis is now great and she does not have any residual evidence of heart disease. Wonderful news for sweet Lilly!!*

No more congestive heart failure!!! Our girl has a healthy heart and we are beside ourselves with joy and praise and thankfulness for answered prayers!

This has been a long post, but it’s been a long six months. As many of you surely know on this sub, there is now an FDA investigation into a potential connection between diet and cases of canine heart disease. The internet, like always, is fuuuuuuuull of opinions. I not only have an opinion but have first-hand experience, and it’s worth sharing. This happened to Lilly. This is not just a post on the internet now, my girl went through this.

&amp;#x200B;

I would bet that all of y’all on this sub love your dogs like we love ours and I want everyone to know what happened here. Maybe this will help someone else, if not about choosing what type of dog food to buy, then giving you something to consider if your dog is having these type of heart issues, then perhaps it would be worth getting a taurine panel ran. But, beyond this, don’t get caught up in the latest and greatest, just because everyone else is doing it. You got to do what is right for you and your dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry to ramble, but thanks for reading. If you have any questions, I'll be glad to try to answer as best that I can- if not tonight, I'll check back tomorrow and as needed.

517,[Help] Just adopted 1 year old shiba. How can I be a good mom?,dogs,t3_a8jhgk,2,False,False,a8jhgk,"Hello! Long story short, our previous tenant abandoned his 1 year old shiba inu and my family has decided to adopt it. I've been watching videos and reading articles on how to care and train for a puppy, but it's a bit overwhelming. Some facts:  
1. He's about 1 year old  
2. Never trained  
2. He's an outdoors dog but we'd like to transition him to being an indoors dog.   
3. I don't live here, so it'll be my dad training and taking care of the dog once I leave after the holidays. He primarily speaks Chinese, so if there are any Chinese language resources (trainers, videos, meetups in the San Francisco Bay Area) that would be great.

I'm basically starting at square one as I've never raised a shiba puppy before. I'd love some advice on:  
1. How much time should we expect to spend on training, socializing, and exercising at first, then per day after he gets the basics down?   
2. How to train and socialize him. Do it myself, hire a trainer, what basic things to start with. Anything particular to shibas I should know?   
3. Living situation - inside garage, inside house, in crate, in pen?  
4. Day to day what's your routine? Also how often do you get them groomed, go for a vet checkup, to the dog park, etc?  
5. Any other shiba specific things I should know or watch out for?  
6. Any recs for food, treats, toys, bed, etc.   
7. What to do with the pup when everyone's at work to keep him occupied/not anxious?  
8. Name ideas! :)   
9. Any resources - puppy classes, youtube channels, trainers in the area, podcasts, blogs, books  
10. Diet  
11. Cost - how much should we expect to spend?

I'm don't live in the Bay Area at the moment, so my dad will be the one spending the most time with him and reinforcing the training after I leave. We'll see how that goes and if he's not able to do that, I might take him up to Seattle with me.

Sydney showed up in a rural shelter near us, marked ""urgent"", on a weekend when my partner was out of town.  She was a scrawny little ragamuffin, but I'm so glad I saw past that and trusted my instincts.  Her personality just sparkled, even in the concrete cage.  It took her one day to win over our other dog, and about one month to wrap herself around my partner's heart.  Her first photo album is [here](https://imgur.com/a/BT1k8).

Since then, she's earned her Canine Good Citizen title (unpracticed, on her first try, by the skin of her teeth!), eagerly traveled on all our ski trips, and turned into a happy [little camper](https://imgur.com/Rc0i6y8).

we have another dog who has no issues with separation or house training.the one with the problem is maybe 5 or 6 and had spent two years in the shelter before we adopted her. she has minor issues but the peeing is the worst, she is ruining our carpet. both of us work from home which I think makes our leaving more stressful. it doesn't matter if we just walked her or if we restrict water, it doesn't matter if we are gone 5 minutes or 5 hours, she will pee. I'm afraid forcing her into a crate will cause more issues and separating the dogs will probably not go over well. they have really bonded. "

She seems happy and healthy as usual, but it seems like an awful lot of blood.  I'd rather not go to the vet and pay a ton of money getting her checked out.

Does anyone have experience with dogs in heat that knows how much blood is expected?  Without the diapers she licks so it seems like less blood, but with the diapers she can't lick so I'm thinking it just seems like a lot of blood to me.  Is this normal or should I pay a vet to check her out?"

533,[Help] Visiting Family for the winter break. How to prevent my dogs from regressing on their crate habits? and not cry in new situations?,dogs,t3_a8hrb0,3,False,False,a8hrb0,"Hello,

So I'm visiting family for the winter break and I brought my dogs with me and their crates. We will be staying at my families home where there are two other pugs here. 

The dogs get along ok. Not perfect they tolerate each other. while supervised, but when my dogs want to start playing the pugs don't like and they all start getting feisty. The problem I'm fearing is that when we all go out, I don't want to leave the dogs alone with the pugs in case a fight breaks out. So I will be keeping them in a separate room and in their crates while we are away. The thing is that any time that I'm away and the pugs are walking around. My dogs begin to cry while in their crates. 

My dogs used to do this when I first got them, but since I live alone in an apartment, when I left my apartment and left them in their crates they would just go to sleep and relax, but with other dogs walking around outside of their room they get agitated and want to be let out, so they cry. I'm afraid that they will regress back and start crying in their crates when I leave when I'm back at my apartment. If they do regress then that will cause a lot of noise complaints.

Is there a way to prevent this? I'm thinking that a solution is just to keep the pugs in another room, where they can't walk near my dogs while they are in their crate, but there will be time when I leave the house and family members and the pugs will still walk around the house, and I don't trust the dogs to just walking around freely in the house without agitating the pugs or vice versa, so ideally I'd like to keep them separated unless I'm personally supervising them. Unfortunately, I don't think my siblings want to supervise my dogs while I'm away.

Any suggestions or solutions will be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!"
534,"[Help] Dog has constsnt discharge. Not too sure what it is, niether does the vey.",dogs,t3_a8e7bv,14,False,False,a8e7bv,"Was wondering if anyone else has come across this issue and knew what this was 

My adopted dog (a little over a year) has consistent vaginal? discharge all the time.  It's kind of cloudy and stringy (it all wants to stay together in one piece) and it really smells.  Almost like metal.  While constant it gets worse at times in terms of frequency and then becomes less frequent.  I wouldn't call it cyclical bit it changes in how often it happens.  It gets really bad some weeks. Other dogs seem really interested in it and like to smell it (gross).

I do notice that sometimes she has the discharge start before she needs to go out to pee.

I've been to my vet multiple times and they don't know what it is.  They confirmed that it's sterile and not an infection and it's not hurting my pup.  It's just kind of gross, gets  on everything and I would like to stop it if possible.  It can't be great for her- and she is constantly licking it/eating it.

It's not a UTI or stump pyometra.

Anyone have this issues before?  Any suggestions on what it could be/ how to fix this?

538,[Discussion] Couple from which we got our dog 2 years ago trying to invite themselves over. Extremely inappropriate or am I overreacting?,dogs,t3_a87n61,32,False,False,a87n61,"My partner and I got a mixed-breed puppy in March 2017. I emphasize mixed-breed to make clear we didn't get it from a breeder, this was just a middle-aged couple whose own dogs had had a ""happy accident"".

Now, when they came to hand over the puppy (we even paid for it, signed a contract etc.) the wife was quite emotional - cried, even. They have eight other dogs at home and Just got this litter of three - if it had been her way I'm sure she would have wanted to keep them too, but I suspect her husband had the last say. Since they came over to visit us to see if the pup would be getting a good home, they now knew our address. 

Since then, the lady has continuously attempted to contact us and arrange a visit several times per year. At one point, around our dog's first birthday, she called and asked if she can come over and bring him a toy. We said it's not a good idea. She said ""Oh but I'm in the neighborhood, it'll only be a few minutes!"". We said we're going to see family and are getting ready to leave. That was the end of it, or so we thought. 

My partner's sister came to pick us up and as we got into the car she said ""X was just here asking if I lived here and could let her into the building. I said I'm just waiting to pick you up and she flustered and said 'oh you must be Y's sister, you look so alike!' Then she gave me the present for Pup and left.""

So apparently she thought we were lying/hurried over regardless and was looking for a way to get in and catch us at home. I freaked out. But anyway, after that there was radio silence for a while and I thought she got the message that this isn't her dog anymore and she should back off. Until a few months back, when she tried to call my partner again, several times. Then texted him, asking if we could meet up. He didn't reply.

Yesterday we got a Christmas card from her, her husband and ""the doggies"". Nice gesture if it had come from anyone else, but for me personally now it just makes my blood boil. I'm having nightmares that this woman will somehow, some day, make her way into our building, knock on our door and kidnap our dog once we open. I'm overexaggerating, I know, but I am kinda angry, so forgive me.

539,[Help] Scarf and barf solutions?,dogs,t3_a8engn,7,False,False,a8engn,"Anyone who's dealt with scarf and barf before, what solutions did you find that worked?    

I have a ~2.5 year old lab/pit mix.  I've had her for about 2 years.  For these 2 years I have fed her the same food throughout.  Always one cup in the morning and one in the evening.    

Over the past ~2 months or so, I have been coming home multiple times a week to her vomit which is primarily whole pieces of her food still in tact.  It started out infrequently but seems to be happening more often now.    

I called my vet and they said it sounded like classic scarf and barf.  My dog definitely would eat her food as quickly as possible and was not chewing most of it.  I bought a ""puzzle"" bowl per their recommendation and it has slowed down her eating considerably.  However, she is still not chewing the majority of the meal - she just picks up a couple pieces, swallows, repeats.  Then a few hours later she starts drooling, vomits, and then drools for hours afterwards.

Anyone have any suggestions on how to get her to chew her food instead of swallowing?  I considered changing her food but I don't think that's the issue as she was fine eating this food for almost 2 years.  Also, it seems to be the morning meal that usually ends up coming back up, not the evening meal.  Though the problem has still happened a couple times after the evening meal.  Other than this, she seems fine.  No noticeable changes in behavior or discomfort, she still seems like herself and is always up for some play and attention.

Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.  Thanks and happy Holidays! "
540,[Discussion] TIL what a low battery chirp on a smoke detector can do psychologically to your dog,dogs,t3_a8fp9v,4,False,False,a8fp9v,"My dog Timber has anxiety that he’s on medication for. He gets very nervous sometimes and shakes but what I experienced today seemed very abnormal for him. 

I put him in his kennel before I left for an appointment this morning. I got home about 2 hours later and we immediately went for a walk. He was fine our whole walk. But upon arriving home, he was glued to my side, panting excessively, and shaking very hard. I sat down on the couch and he wanted to be on top of my lap. This went on for an hour or so before I ran to the store to get dinner. The behaviors continued when I got home. 

I decided to call my vets on call number. They advised me to sit with him for a half hour or so and if the behaviors didn’t settle to call back so that he could be seen. While I was sitting there, trying to calm Timber down, I heard the smoke detector in the hall chirp. I immediately ran to pull the battery out. And my dog is suddenly fixed! He is fine now and cuddled up at my side.  

I feel SO terrible that he had to listen to that chirp all day and I couldn’t help him sooner. I found articles about this exact situation and apparently they’re called noise phobias. This is something that has ever even occurred to me! Has anyone else had this issue with their pups?"

542,[Update] [Help] No solution | Sick Dog,dogs,t3_a8h4ls,1,False,False,a8h4ls,"My original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/a5es23/helpvent\_sick\_dog/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/a5es23/helpvent_sick_dog/)

&amp;#x200B;

I took my big boy last week to the vet, his side issue wasn't major and there was nothing too much to stress about. Just his eating issue which is now solved. Two days ago I woke up with puddles of blood over the house, this isn't an exaggeration, there was blood on the walls, on the floor, all over him, and I was just lost and confused and angry, I didn't understand what was going on. Last week, the vet had given him a steroid shot and antibiotics, and somehow instead of bettering his condition it got way worse and caused whatever was is infesting his side to rupture. I rushed to the vet with him gushing blood nonstop.

&amp;#x200B;

They did **nothing**. They gave me more medications racking up to 300$ which he can't start until he finishes his current antibiotic. They did a culture and we wont know anything until after Christmas. They want me to come in early in the morning tomorrow for a check up, I have no money anymore as the last two visits have been 600$, I have no way of paying anything. I'm in massive debt from trying to obtain solutions for my buddy for over 3 months now. I've spent over 2k trying to find out what's wrong with his side and no one has been able to give me an answer. To this day I have no answer. I'm a college student, I work as seasonal with minimum wage; I come in put on a smile no matter how much I'm suffering from my personal life and work extremely hard in hopes of getting a regular job there and have some kind of financial income. I keep picking up any shift in the hopes of saving my dog, I don't even care if I work there 5 days straight double shifts, it just means I have more money to put towards my pet. My family is in major financial trouble, we even lost power yesterday and we had to scrounge up the little money we had to pay the electric bill.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the vets have decided they don't want to operate on him since I've brought it up last visit and kept asking for an estimate, according to them it's because the problem is so large, there's no way to connect the skins back together, since they have to remove **more** than 8x8in of skin. I don't know how the vets could've let this get so bad, I don't understand how they don't know what's going on. They tell me not to clean him, not to leave him outside, he's wearing a cone to prevent him from licking his side, he's frustrated and I understand that he is, I'm frustrated myself. I don't want to give him up, I've lost literally any hope in my life for him. I'm scared of tomorrow, I sincerely have no desire for it to come.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm doing something wrong because I'm doing everything people tell me today, get a job, pay for the problem, work more hours, more money. Go to a vet, problem solved. Go to school, everything will get better.

&amp;#x200B;

Things only keep getting worse and worse and worse, and I just can't. I don't want him to get euthanized, but I don't even have money to help him, the vets have drained the last cent and my own mom says I'm being irresponsible and that he's a very sick dog that needs help to drop him. It's like she's ignored everytime I've taken him to the vet?? But I've done as much as I possibly can and more than any rescue is willing to do. I can't make a solution appear out of thin air?? I took him to the vet and the vet doesn't know the answer, what more could I possibly do!?

&amp;#x200B;

I've called the ONLY TWO vet dermatologists in town and they are ALL booked until January, they don't accept emergencies and the one time they were willing to bring me in, was 220$ at the door just to see the doctor, after that it was whatever examinations, tests, etc they would want to add. They estimated over the phone over 600$. I had less than 7$ in my bank account, and my credit cards were already maxed. I wanted to curl up and scream my life out. I don't know what else to do, there has to be a solution. There just has to be, I wish I just had it right in front of me."

But over the course of a few months, she became really clumsy - occasionally bump into things, miss the bottom stair on her way out, things like that. Took her to the vet for a whole workup, and everything came back fine. Eyes, ears, bloodwork, all good. No nausea, vomiting, or other functional problems at all, but she seems to have gradually gotten more unstable. 

Like she'll attempt to jump on the couch and fall straight back or shake her head and have to pause before she moves to keep from falling over. She's only fallen all the way over a couple times, she usually just leans to the side for a sec till she can correct herself. As long as she is walking/running in a straight line, she's good. It's sudden changes in direction, elevation, or going from lying on her side to standing straight up that are problematic. She doesn't have any head tilt at all, but the nystagmus is pretty pronounced. 

Everyone I've talked to so far has said old dog syndrome till they find out how young she is. Others have said a possible tumor or lesion. I guess I was just wondering if anyone has had a young dog experience old dog disease symptoms and what the outcome was. Can younger dogs have persistent vertigo (BPPV) with no underlying cause like humans? The way she acts honestly reminds me of my dad and aunt who've had vertigo their entire adult lives... just runs in the family."
547,[Discussion] Suddenly Really Anxious about a Board and Train,dogs,t3_a8entz,41,False,False,a8entz,"I’ve been looking forward to sending my bullmastiff x pit to a specialized trainer for a board and train (10+ days) to learn some advanced tasks and become solidly public-ready CGC-style (*again*—he backslid when I started graduate school and didn’t have time to train as much). I scheduled it way back in early June (because that’s seriously how booked this trainer is; he’s currently booked through August), and I’ve been super excited ever since, and I’ve been putting back the money for it for a couple months.

However, now that he’s supposed to leave in a week, I’m freaking out a little. I’ve only been away for him for a week once and maybe for 2-4 days a handful of times since I got him four years ago. He’s my shadow, and I spend a LOT of time focusing on him and his wellbeing daily. I can’t imagine him being gone for potentially up to two weeks.

I guess I just wanted some support because I’m becoming increasingly anxious and have even considered canceling several times (although I won’t). For the past week or so I constantly catch myself delivering hypothetical monologues to my trainer regarding his extensive list of commands and care etc. I think I’m slowly driving myself nuts worrying about this even though I feel confident he’s going to have a blast and come back as lovely as ever.

Edit: Since I specifically asked for support but instead received mostly skepticism, I guess I should jump into the details I decided not to bore you with.

Firstly, I’ve been seeking a qualified trainer in my area for years, and I’ve finally found him. As I mentioned in my post, this trainer is a specialist who specifically trains working dogs. His day job is training K9s for local police stations, and in his private business he works with everything from the average house pet to PPD, search and rescue, and hunting dogs among other working types.

I strongly believe in board and trains and I know many people, from those with pets to those with mobility dogs, who have successfully used board and trains as part of their dogs’ training process.

I am fully aware of the methods my trainer uses, and his methods align with my training philosophy, including e-collar and prong collar training. I believe in balanced training, and while I use clicker training, shaping, that sort of thing, I do not agree with dogmatic positive-only trainers. So yeah, I’m not worried about my trainer sneakily using “aversive” training methods. He is only one man; this is not a multi-trainer company but rather a personal business.

I not only know people who have worked with this trainer but also had the good fortune to run into him while doing a PPD session with a client and his GSD. I am well versed in the characteristics of ethical PPD training and the telltale signs of bad PPD training that causes dogs anxiety/stress/fear.

My dog has a very strong foundation in everything I want proofed by the trainer. There is nothing I hope he accomplishes that is a new concept to him. I used to train him over 20 hours per week, and now I’m down to about 8-10 hours a week. I am aware that there is no use renovating a car to mint condition only to let it rust in the yard. And the trainer does work with clients before and after the board and train. I’m not just dropping him off and picking him up.

*The only anxiety that I am experiencing is that of knowing my dog will not be with me, because I will miss him, and he is an integral part of my daily life.*

Thanks for your concern."

Let’s say you’ve been seeing someone and are really hitting it off. You each have your own dog(s) at home, but when you try introducing your dogs to one another, they don’t get along at all. If things got more serious with this person, say to the point of wanting to move in together, what would you do? 

For the sake of clarity, I’ll say that this hypothetical occurred to me after I and a guy I’ve been seeing casually introduced our dogs to one another when he stayed over for a night, and we basically just quarantined each dog to one half of the house with an elaborate system of baby gates and closed doors! I have a 4lb F chihuahua and he has a 40lb F boxer, both dog aggressive— you see the issue. The prospect of moving in together or anything is so distant and improbable that it’s not worth actually worrying about, but since this is my first time dating since getting my dog the logistical issues are quite new and interesting to me.

I have a 10-year old Maltese male who’s always been pretty bad with the groomer...any groomer. He whines incessantly, he has urinated and defecated and he has been known to growl.

Well, we’ve had a reversion. The last two times he went to the groomer he acted a complete FOOL. He snapped at her, pissed everywhere, just a mess. She couldn’t even finish.

Is it normal for “senior” dogs to have this type of behavior regression? What can I do? He has to be groomed; even if I bath him regularly, I can’t cut his hair (it seriously looks like r/fuckmyshitup when I do lol).

553,"[Help] Holy unit of measurment, Batman.",dogs,t3_a89eg9,31,False,False,a89eg9,"Hi, guys! First post here! 

Yesterday, I brought home my first dog. I've fostered a lot of dogs in the past but this is my first time figuring out issues without a rescue backing me up. And boy howdy, she has some issues.

She's a 4 year old bulldog who is SEVERLY overweight, has next to zero social skills, and has lived up to this point in either a kennel or run. She has diarrhea, and was being fed probiotic pills like treats (they gave her 3 while I was talking to them). She was being kept outside and smelled so bad that I had to ride home with the windows cracked.

I've got an appointment set up with my vet for after Christmas. We stopped by the office to introduce her and make the appointment, and the main thing she was concerned with was her weight. She weighed in at around 67lbs.

So I need a little bit of advice.


How much should she be eating a day? Should I wean her down to a smaller amount slowly? She was being fed 2 cups of food, 3 times a day.


How fast should we increase our walks? She can almost make it around 1 city block before she starts getting tired right now.


My vet advised rice water and pumpkin for the upset tummy. How much of this should I offer her? How often? If this doesn't help, whats the next step until her appointment?


Do you have any tips for socializing her safely? Or anything else that I might find helpful?"
554,[Vent] My cousin bought a yellow lab and literally never walks it,dogs,t3_a7ybfw,117,False,False,a7ybfw,"Need to rant a bit about shitty pet owners.

So I've come home to see the fam for xmas and today my aunt tells me that my cousin (SC for shitty cousin) never walks her lab puppy, not even once a week. SC is always working/going to uni/interning and isn't home most of the time, so she says she doesn't have the time to walk the puppy. The poor pup was shut in a cage for the majority of the day until she outgrew it, now she gets to roam around my cousin's bedroom (which is the apartment's living room) and the covered concrete courtyard... so \~40m2 of space with no sunlight. ALL DAY. EVERYDAY.

SC bought the puppy on a whim, never trains her (although she said she's trained the puppy to not need walks?!) and has no plan to spay the puppy because of the cost. I think the puppy has been taken out in total about 5 times and she's now about 8 months old.

I've just been pissed about this for the pass few hours and thinking about what I should say to SC when I next see her. Welcome to suggestions

EDIT: SC lives at her own place with two flatmates, doggo is locked out in the courtyard these days when nobody is home so that's where she does her business. SC can definitely afford vet bills/a dog walker, but doesn't want to fork out it seems. My aunt isn't her mum, so there's only so much she can do/say, SC is going on another 3 week holiday in 2 months and my aunt's already offered to dog sit for free.  She and my uncle loves dogs so the doggo will at least have some free air and walks with them.

I would help her rehome doggo in a second, I'm just don't think SC would want to part with her because she's cute, quiet and doesn't make too much of a mess. There's only so much I can do because I live overseas for work and I hardly come home. The ideal scenario is that SC steps up, I'm just afraid that she'll agree to everything I say, promise to do better, do jackshit in reality and I'm a 9 hr flight away do anything about it. "
555,[Help] What breed - for second dog - is right for us?,dogs,t3_a8fvp7,2,False,False,a8fvp7,"1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Second dog. Wife grew up with dogs her whole life. I grew up around dogs but never had my own till we were married. Currently we have an Aussie Shepherd, one year old, male, neutered. 

 2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

No.

 3. Describe your ideal dog.

A big affectionate dog that's up for a long hike but able to relax and nap when we're done. My only complain with the current dog (Aussie Shepherd) is he doesn't EVER turn off. I'll run him 6 miles hard and he still wants non stop playtime all day. It can get a little frustrating. 

 4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Wife is interested in Golden and Labs, I like greater Swiss, Bernese mountain dog, saint Bernard, Irish wolfhound, Mastiff. Again, we'd like bigger, a little calmer, and affectionate. 


 5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Hiking above all. Long car rides - often times to more hiking. And must be a good family companion. 


Care Commitments

 1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We have opposite work schedules so the crate/alone time can be minimized. 

 2. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

We have a fenced in yard, access to dog parks, tons of great nearby dog friendly hikes and trails, and I currently get up early to run my dog before work. On days off I usually take him on an adventure. 


 3. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Yes yes and yes

Personal Preferences

 1. What size dog are you looking for?

Big. Like 90 pounds or more

 2. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and slobber we're not overly concerned with. The house is already full of dog hair and our current dog is a kisser. Barking we'd like to keep down if possible. 

 3. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

He/she needs to be okay at a dog park

Dog Personality and behavior

 1. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly

 2. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I want a companion

 3. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

I'm okay with protective behavior, but not aggressive

 4. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I'll avoid it if at all possible

 5. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Aggression is my biggest concern. Regardless of gender we will get the dog fixed, but yeah. I Don't want an attack dog

Lifestyle

 1. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Worst case scenario, 6 hours in a pen or gated off area. 

 2. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My wife and I are a team effort, 50/50

 3. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

Current one male fixed one year old aussie shepard. Possible more pets in future but no concrete plans now. 

 4. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Children within the next few years

 5. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Home owner

 6. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

US/ North East

 7. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Cold and sad / hot and moist"

Most places wouldn't even respond to me, as I have a normal job, and would be a single dog parent. I'm assuming most didn't think that was ideal, but I was allowed to come see you anyway.

I got you when I had finished working on the movie The Incredibles 2, and took a few days off to go [meet you](https://imgur.com/NctPube), fall in love with you, and take you home. I remember being so nervous, I didn't have a crate to put you in, and I didn't have a harness to keep you still while I was driving, but [you just sat there, watching the world go by, completely happy and perfect.](https://imgur.com/jM81rbH) I had never taken care of anything else on my own. I've almost always been alone, and you fixed that.

You adjusted to my life so fast. You didn't bark, you learned how to use the doggy door in a matter of days, and you were so easy to take care of. You had walks every day, by me and a dog walker, and you barely pulled, but you slammed on the brakes all the time to stop and sniff everything. You had so many beds, [a bed in every room](https://imgur.com/Tl89iVZ). So many treats. I put my heart into you and you always just gave me as much love as you could. [You would fall asleep on me](https://imgur.com/pcLVSqu), and I'll never forget how I would let a big sigh out before going to sleep and you would always do the same. Just a deep breath before bed. Just like me.

There were some tough times, you had a bad case of [puppy warts](https://imgur.com/Yzk1zS0) that scared the hell out of me. You got over that, and then had urinary issues, which pills fixed, and then allergies, which pills fixed, but of all things I wish I had known the state of your kidneys.

We did so many things together, so much of my time and life over the past 10 months has been dedicated to you. I made you [puzzles and toys](https://imgur.com/xLJ3YWo).

I pushed you away and couldn't figure out what was wrong, so you went to the vet the next day. They did xrays, and poked and prodded, and gave you pain killers. They assumed you strained yourself running around at the beach, and I believed you would get better with rest.

But then you started yelping and screaming whenever you had to get up. You trembled and shook. And I thought you were just being a wuss. I've had sore muscles, and you just suck it up! But it got harder and harder for you to get up off the ground. The vet saw you again and prescribed different pain killers. You had such a hard time this last week and I became so frustrated. I was so scared that I would have to deal with a dog that gets sick every 2 months. This last week I watched you slowly die and I was so selfish and scared. You wouldn't lay down because it was so hard to get up. You would just come by and stand next to me, and [put your head on me.](https://imgur.com/q4pSMSD)

I took you to the neurologist yesterday to get an mri done because I wanted more than anything for you to get better. I never considered that your kidneys could have failed. They said it was congenital, and there was nothing I could do. I wish I could have shown you the love I had for you over the last week instead of assuming it was a small speed bump in your life.

563,[Help] Bigger dog constantly biting smaller one,dogs,t3_a8eewx,0,False,False,a8eewx,"Hi. I have two dogs, both very young  (oldest is about 20 months old). One is mixed  (Lab + unknown, probably) and the other one is a Dobberman. Neither are neutered.

Although he is younger, the Dobberman is considerably bigger and stronger and he seems to constantly leverage this power into one activity: biting the Lab. He closes his jaws around the Lab's neck and bites him into what I assume is submission. Sometimes there is humping involved too.

Almost every interaction I see between the dogs is pretty much defined by this. They playfight and then the Dobberman bites the Lab. I pet them and the Dobberman bites the Lab.
This behavior bothers me a lot because it seems to be negatively affecting the Lab. He often seems to not enjoy it and will try to run away or fight back, but will pretty much invariably end up being bitten. When I get out alone with him (to the vet, for example) he seems much more happy and lively than he does at home.
I have a strong suspicion the Dobberman is doing this out of jealousy, because he seems to try to keep the Lab away from me and my family and to ""punish"" him for being petted or given attention by biting him. I try to always be fair and distribute attention equally between them, but this is not enough for the Dobberman.

I am at loss about what to do (and whether something should be done) and would really like a little help.

I bought the intranasal type of bordetella vaccine and tried more or less ""shooting"" it straight into my wiggly little dog's nose, but to my dismay, a good portion of it ricocheted out and got all over my arm. I may have gotten a little in after that, but I'm guessing maybe 1/3 of the total vaccine ended up in his nose, if that.

My question is, do I need to go buy another and give him a part of a second vaccine? I'm kind of lost as to what to do next.

Also, what is the best way to get the liquid into a dog's nose? My dog was not having it, hence why I tried to get it all at once.

570,[Discussion] Adoption process frustrations,dogs,t3_a8b5i9,22,False,False,a8b5i9,"We've been trying to adopt a dog for more than two months and are starting to get really frustrated.


Neither of us are first time pet-owners (we have cats, and have fostered dogs) and by all means our application doesn't seem to be the issue here. I don't know if it's just my luck, the rescue foundations near me, or the time of the year, but it seems that none of the rescue organizations care about responding back. I've been in touch with 3 organizations near me and 2 in other states and it takes days, sometimes weeks, to get any kind of information from them about a dog who I think might be a good fit and would like more information on. When they do end up responding it's usually a one-line unenthusiastic email about the questions I've asked with no interest in a follow-up, or the dog has already been adopted so I have to start the process all over again. Two shelters have said that they'll get back to me about another dog because they have my information and I've been through the application process and gotten approved, but then...nothing. Silence. I have to keep prodding to ask them to respond to my last email or phone call. I understand that people who work there are volunteers taking time out of their day to find the perfect home for these pups and are overwhlemed with all the responsibilities, but I'm getting so frustrated that I'm thinking of giving up.


I assumed working with a shelter or dog adoption agency would be easy but this process has been dragging on for way too long with what seems to be a one sided attempt at adoption. It seems I'm the only one who is excited and invested in giving a home to a dog. Is this normal and am I being a nuisance, or should I make more effort into getting in touch with the shelters/try my hand elsewhere? This is my first time adopting instead of fostering so I'm super confused why this is so incredibly different and difficult than fostering. Any advice would be really, really appreciated. Thank you!"
571,[Help] Does my aloof dog like paw massages?,dogs,t3_a8b1jm,2,False,False,a8b1jm,"She technically belongs to my parents. They adopted her as a puppy thinking she would be a small lab mix. Turns out she’s mixed with some Great Dane. She’s 8 years old, big, beautiful, and kind of aloof. Never been much of a cuddler or very affectionate unless she hasn’t seen you in a long time. Aside from that she doesn’t show a lot of love for her people. We love her just the same. 

In the last few years we have noticed she does something kind of odd. When we’re sitting down she’ll paw at us pretty persistently. Again, she’s big so you can’t exactly ignore it either. We give her pets but  that doesn’t seem to be what she wants. Food is in her bowl so that’s not an issue. The only thing that seems to stop her is holding her paw and kind of squeezing it a bit...like a hand massage for her paw. Obviously she will stop (because her paw is in our hand) but she genuinely seems to enjoy it. When we stop, she’ll paw at us even more aggressively. 

Does my dog like paw massages? Is this totally weird or does anyone else’s dog like that? Is she trying to tell us something else?

We have never had any issues with them before, both my pets have had surgeries there and they have always handled all the issues well.
However my dog recently got a bath and a shave there as she got lots of gross stuff stuck in her fur, and she came back itchy and distressed.
She felt discomfort in one ear and had a few missing patches of fur, as well as a lot of redness around her face and her underbelly.
We didn’t think too much of it as we thought it was just from the gunk pulling on her fur before. However the next day we saw she had scratched her chest raw and had lots of dandruff-like bits all over her.
I was worried it was dermatitis or something like that so I immediately scheduled an appointment. They did blood tests and skin scrapes and when they came back, they said it was probably an allergic reaction to the bath they gave her and that I should just wash her again at home with a special shampoo they gave me. 
I thought they would apologise for not spotting the problem when we went to pick her up after her bath, or some form of compensation, like the shampoo on the house. Instead we got charged about €100 for the consultation.

I have a Maltese who's recently gone through Luxating patella surgery. She's about 3 weeks post op and tonight we noticed dark red marks appear on the inside of her leg, kinda like bruising. She's about 2.5 years and 4.5kg

She's been a nightmare to try and keep relaxed. She constantly wants to jump and run even in crate confinement. She's actually knocked over the pen we've been keeping her in while trying to escape. This was just 2 days after the cast came off

To be fair, she's calm for the majority of the time. For the most part she's just lying down relaxing. The problems come when the door bell or phone rings - she gets overly excited and jumps. 

Today, the doorbell rang and she jumped a few times. We picked her up to stop that and we noticed these marks appear on her leg. She has no (apparent) pain, she can still walk like she has been and it seems like nothing's wrong. 

She's going to the vet tomorrow (well, in 9 hours) but just for peace of mind, we're hoping it's just some bruising but we don't like that it happened right after jumping. 

Does anyone have experience with this surgery, and what could have happened to cause a bruise/internal bleeding like that? Keep in mind she seems absolutely normal like nothing's happened.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I've never owned a dog before, but I have some experience looking after them. I've done a lot of research though, and will do more once I've decided on the breed.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Either is fine. I just want it to be the right one for me.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Loyal, intelligent but not too stubborn, quick to learn and quick to obey once trained.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Vizsla has always been dear to me, but from what I've heard, they're only sold to homes that hunt.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Advanced obedience, some agility as a hobby. Running off-leash so we can go hiking together.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2 hours on average.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours. Dog park a few times a week, hikes and swimming whenever possible (summers are short here), agility once a week and long walks daily. I don't have a yard though.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'll do the nail clipping and such myself as needed, but I prefer dogs with shorter hair that only needs to be brushed maybe once a week and are easy to keep clean and stink free.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium. I prefer bigger dogs, but they're not always good for apartments.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I can handle, slobber is a no-no. I want a breed that either barks very little, or can be trained to not bark.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Doesn't matter that much.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More eager to please.

* Preferably not by barking. Can either be friendly or aloof, but not aggressive.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Preferably not. Will have to get along with my sister's smaller dog, as they'll be spending a lot of time together.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* High prey drive. I don't want the dog going after my cats, or any wild life when off leash.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* There's always someone in the house, or I'll take the dog with me.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* No preference, walking and playing with the dog occasionally.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have two cats.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, whenever I'm visiting my family. The kids are old and respectful enough to handle dogs with care, but obviously can be loud and energetic.

580,[Help] Anyone has experience with Pyometra surgery recovery?,dogs,t3_a889v5,3,False,False,a889v5,"My pitbull girl is 13 years old and she had an open pyometra surgery 5 days ago. I was extremely worried for her, but everything seemed to be just fine. The day after she was almost back to her normal self, eating, peeing, wagging her tail... I made sure she got plenty of rest and she never tried biting her stitches or anything. It seemed almost too good to be true (because the infection went for a long time unnoticed and they took 6.6 lbs of infected uterus out of her) - now it is day 5 and she's off antibiotics and all of a sudden she seems much worse.

581,[Help] Family dog is aggressive towards me when other people are around,dogs,t3_a8bpnp,3,False,False,a8bpnp,"Sorry that this is so long, I didn’t want to exclude anything that might be helpful. The dog is almost 3 years old, spayed female border collie mix. We just had her to a new vet that we really liked three weeks ago for a full checkup including bloodwork, she’s perfectly healthy. We didn’t switch vets over this but the old vet brushed this behavior off basically saying ‘that’s how dogs are sometimes’. The new vet told me to try taking more of a primary caretaker role with her – being the one who feeds her, walks her, etc. I already did that for the most part but started doing it 100% of the time, telling my husband and daughter not to do anything for her and to come get me instead. That really isn’t making difference though.


She’s been doing this since we first got her when she was around 6 months old. She has gotten better, in the beginning it was a lot more frequent, 4-5 times a day. Now she only gets aggressive maybe a few times a week. She’ll start barking at me, charging at me, and then biting me. She doesn’t bite with full force, but hard enough to leave bruises and sometimes break the skin. Sometimes it’s for no reason at all, I might have just walked past her. Other times there’s a clear reason like if I take something from her or tell her no if she’s chewing something *but* I can do these things 9 out of 10 times with no problem, 10/10 times when we’re alone.


The things I’ve tried:

- The first thing I tried was firmly saying no and offering a variety of toys to bite instead. She has zero interest in any of the toys when she gets like this, nothing distracts her. 
- My husband doesn’t like crates since he has seen his dad and sister abuse crate training. So for the first 6 months I’d consistently put her in the spare bedroom for a 15 minute time out. This did not help at all. Of course she’d be fine when I let her out, but she would do it again two hours later like the punishment never happened. 
- Then I tried picking her up and sitting down while holding her on my lap until she calmed down, repeating no and stop the entire time. She would usually settle down in 5 minutes or less this way. But would do it again the next time the mood struck her. None of these “time outs” seem to condition her at all, it’s just a temporary fix in the moment it’s happening. 
- I thought maybe it’s a dominance thing, maybe she wants to tell me that when others are around she and them are above me in her hierarchy. So I’d stand up, not back away from her, and firmly repeat No! Stop! She knows these words and obeys them any other time. With this she normally continues for a minute or two until she sees it isn’t going anywhere then slowly winds down, ending up hiding behind someone while growling/grumbling at me.
- I’ve tried ignoring it. If I walk away she chases me and bites. If I sit down and do something else she’ll charge and pounce at me, biting progressively harder until she gets a reaction and then resumes the barking/charging tantrum until she tires of it like described above.


I spend the most time with her since I work from home except for 10-12 hours a week. One of my first thoughts was that being part border collie she just needs more exercise and mental stimulation. For the past two years I’ve taken her jogging with me almost every day, she has a very large fenced yard to run in any time she wants, she has two other animals to play with, we take her out to play fetch or football, she goes with us anytime anyone is running an errand so she’s out seeing new things, we are pretty outdoorsy and she is with us anytime we’re hiking, camping, fishing, whatever. She has puzzle toys, all kinds of regular toys, we teach her tricks to keep her mind busy, she’s very smart and learns quickly. This is her normal life, it’s not boring. And she’s usually pretty happy and otherwise mostly well behaved. 


When I’m the only person home she is perfect. It’s when anyone else is around that she acts out. It would make sense if it were just certain people, but it’s everyone that she knows – my husband, our daughter, friends and family who visit, anyone she’s familiar with. Everyone has tried to discourage the behavior but it makes no difference. No one is doing anything to positively reinforce this – no pets, no attention, no “oh it’s ok”, nothing. Sometimes she’ll stop if my husband tells her no, but sometimes not. We live in the middle of nowhere, the closest trainer is a 2.5 hour drive each way, that’s not feasible. And from the facebook page I saw (they didn’t have a real website), it doesn’t look like they’re even a professional. They had no certifications or mentions of their training. 


I have never hurt this dog in any way at all, no one in my family has. We love animals. We don’t know exactly what the first 6 months of her life were like since we got her from a shelter, all they said was that a nice older couple dropped her off because they couldn’t handle her. I didn’t see that as a red flag, a lot of times older people can’t handle puppies, especially energetic breeds. And she obviously passed the shelter’s behavior tests so she must not have been doing this with them. I don’t know if there’s something about me that reminds her of something she doesn’t like or what. I’ve heard that border collies will “herd” people but from what I understand of it I don’t think that’s what she’s doing. If I’m doing something to trigger this I don’t know what it is because I treat her the same way as I do when we’re alone and she’s fine then. I thought she’d eventually calm down, I thought with everything we do as far as keeping her busy and happy combined with getting older she’d eventually get better. And she has a little, but I’m starting to think she’ll never completely stop. She just terrorizes me. Only me. And only when other people are present. "

586,[Help] Tips on walking two dogs together,dogs,t3_a89fu8,6,False,False,a89fu8,"Hi,

We have two medium-size dogs, a five-year-old male Brittany spaniel/blue heeler mix and a female three-year-old pointer mix. I've done a lot of work with them individually on loose leash walking. And, one-on-one, they are pretty good. But it is hard to walk them together. One will see something and want to stop or mark or see another dog/person and want to interact. They also get a little competitive with who is in front of the other dog, and they react to other people/dogs/animals on the walk differently than if they were alone.

They are not small dogs, so it requires a lot of energy to keep them in check on a walk together. Any advice? I have been taking turns walking one in the morning and the other in the evening and swapping who goes when, but it takes a lot of time. And, always, always, the dog who is left home is upset. My husband can walk them both together, but he is able to keep them at a moderate jog -which minimizes chance for distraction--the whole time. I am not as fit.:-( Are there strategies for walking multiple dogs that are different from walking a single dog by your side?

587,[Help] My dog has been having paw problems for over a year,dogs,t3_a8b28h,4,False,False,a8b28h,"My Febe is a Maltese, and she’ll be 11 in February. For the past year and a half she has developed a nasty habit of licking and sometimes gnawing at her paws. It’s not even a specific paw; she alternates between the four. Because of this, the fur on her paws start to thin and her skin gets dry, flaky, and generally inflamed. Sometimes she even chews them to the point of bleeding.
We’ve tried many things. This includes numerous visits to various vets, and for the most part they just brush it off as allergies, but it’s rare that they actually attempt to fix it. One vet gave us medicine to give to her daily, and it seemed to work for about a week before she started at it again.
We purchased lil booties for Febe to wear to prevent her from chewing, but they’re a little loose (she has tiny feets) so they always manage to slip off. 
My dad read somewhere online that it helps to give her a little spoon of coconut oil every day, and we’ve been doing that for about a week, but still no change. We’re also concerned about the coconut oil because you know how those home remedies can be. I don’t wanna make her sick.
I love my Febe more than anything in the world. I completely adore her and I’m worried! I don’t want her to be in pain. She just won’t stop chewing her paws.

Thing is, my dog pooped about 20 minutes earlier and I definitly picked it up, as I ALWAYS do. There's no way she took a poop where he claimed she did as my eyes are always glued on her and she takes foreeeever to find a good position to poop, so I would've definitly noticed. She didn't even pee, so I have no fucking idea how he thought she took a shit.   


I tried to reason with him like ""Oh sorry, you must be mistaken, my dog didn't poop, I would've picked it up. Sorry for the misunderstanding."" But he continued to scream in my face saying that he watched me and to pick up her damn shit. I said to him if he was so sure to please show me where it was and I'd gladly pick it up but he just continued to scream at me. I was seriously scared. What the hell should I pick up if she didn't poop????    


He went on about how he wants to kill all dogs and their owners and how disgusting we all are. I slowly took off in the other direction being scared shitless and not wanting to be screamed at any longer for something I didn't even do. What should I have done in a situation like this? What would you have done? Do I need to be afraid of the safety of my dog? Should I look for another route to walk from now on?"

Maybe it's because I'm just now getting off antidepressants and can feel things much more strongly, but I can't stop crying. He was my best friend, and often only friend, for such a long time.

Sometimes I think I'll never love anyone or anything like him.

Tears are literally pouring down my face right now. I just don't know how to get past this. He was such a good boy and I miss him so much and want to see him every single day and it never gets any better.

I know it's something I have to work on though, my boyfriend has been very sweet and supportive for the past year-and-a-half. He even helped me bury him. But I understand he expects me to stop crying about it, and I should. I just don't know how.

591,[Help] Anyone have experience with tooth root abscesses?,dogs,t3_a87spk,4,False,False,a87spk,"Hi everyone, my 12 year old Chihuahua/Pom mix has had swelling under his eyes on and off for over a year now. His cheek would swell a little bit and then burst into a little pus mess. The first time it happened we figured it was just a bite from something? So we cleaned it up and it seemed to go back to normal. But now it seems his cheeks are always pus-y. 

So I looked it up and I believe it might be because his teeth are infected. I found that infected teeth can push against the dog's cheeks and cause the swelling followed by eventual burst with pus coming out. 

I'm pretty sure that is what my dog is suffering from but I'm not positive.  To be honest, it doesn't seem to bother him at all. He doesn't show signs of discomfort. We can pet his cheeks and head and he won't pull away. He still eats food normally. But it is pretty gross and I feel bad for him. 

I can't seem to find a price anywhere online for how much treatment is. I am going to bring him to the vet as soon as I get paid. Does anyone have experience with tooth root abscesses with dogs and can share some insight? Also, I'm not even sure if thats for certain what we're dealing with. Any insight is appreciated!"

I was so proud of how my newest pup’s training was going, and at 10 months felt he had exceptional recall.

I was mistaken.

After only 20 minutes out he found a huge soft pile of poop and started rolling! He was a bit ahead of me and the path was icy, so I called him back. He looked right at me, then back down at the poop, and calculated exactly how long he had until I reached him! He got a few more rolls in before I caught up to him. He was a disgusting mess!

At least we got to cross another training milestone when he got his first ever bath when we got home...

Looks like we’ve got more work ahead. I’m a little hurt that a pile of poo was more valuable than me 😪"
595,"[HELP] Please recommend me a healthy dog food brand. I recently learned that a) my dog has an enlarged heart, and b) the potential connection between diet and heart disease",dogs,t3_a84orb,55,False,False,a84orb,"Edit: breed is a shih-tzu.


We are currently feeding our dogs Orijen (by Champion Petfoods) senior dog food which they have been eating since 2015 or possibly earlier.


In regards to heart disease... In 2017 the vet mentioned that my dog had a low-grade heart murmur. Fast forward to last month. She started coughing a bit and when we took her to the vet, we learned that she has a grade 3 heart murmur now and the radiograph shows an enlarged heart. She is currently on some heart medication. I believe one of the medications caused loss of appetite and heavy breathing but did resolve the coughing (Furosemide). She is on Vetmedin now and has regained her appetite and breathing normally!


As for diet... I recently learned two things:

1) The current FDA investigation about the potential connection between DCM and diet containing peas, lentils, other legume seeds, or potatoes

2) Orijen, which I always thought was a high-quality locally-made dog food (I'm from Canada), changed their formula and moved their plant to the US in early 2016 or late 2015. Based on some posts in this subreddit, apparently the new formula uses less meat and more peas/lentils/legumes for protein which I have noticed in the ingredients list.


I am not saying there is a connection between Orijen (by Champion Petfoods) and my dog's enlarged heart but I want to be safe than sorry and avoid those ingredients. (Though I have found some news articles about this brand and heart disease, i.e. https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/investigations/-we-were-in-tears-heart-disease-toxins-among-growing-fears-in-boutique-dog-foods)


Please recommend me a good dog food brand! I have been reading as much as possible on dog nutrition and there is so much misinformation out there still. However, I have learned some things like grains aren't bad for dogs, sites like dogfoodadvisor are misleading, and homemade dog food may lack a lot of nutrition which is why I want to stick with store-bought dry dog food.

596,[Help] My dog bit my Girlfriend. Unsure about what to do.,dogs,t3_a86r8n,4,False,False,a86r8n,"Two days ago our dog Frank bit my GF when she called him away from his bone to pet him. She told me she was giving him some scratches when he randomly freaked out and bit her on the face. **She has since been to the ER and everything is fine.** Frank is a 2 year old Male Flat coated retriever. We got him from the pound 4 months ago, besides all this he's a very smart and intelligent dog. He knew the standard sit, stay , don’t piss in the house when we got him. He was very sweet and non aggressive but since we got him he has shown signs of protectiveness. A little with me and a lot with my GF. 

This is not the first time Frank has bitten before. **He bit me on the face** for laying down on his tail (by accident) and **bitten one of our close friends**. In that instance our friend had entered the door, Frank had given them the sniff test and was walking around just doing dog stuff and our friend felt un-easy, they turned away from frank then he bit them on the leg. 

Before he bit my girlfriend and I, we started taking him to dog training classes and even got a personal behavioral trainer, he was doing great. 

Once my GF parents find out about the bite they will demand that we either **give the dog away or kill him.** 

He’s generally a great dog besides all of the biting. My girl and I are unsure of what to do. Is there any hope of getting him to stop this shit or do we have to bite the bullet and give him away. 

**TLDR: Our dog that we have had for 4 months keeps fucking biting us and our friends, we don't know what to do, but we still love the dog.**"

He’s very anxious in general as he has undergone multiple surgeries as a puppy to ensure a healthier life as he grew up. 

My dog’s name is DJ. Every time I pick up the leash and collar, he goes NUTS (in a good way)! His tail wags uncontrollably, he runs to the door, and bursts to the sidewalk when I open it for him. 

He does what every normal dog does on our walks: He looks around, he sniffs the trees and what-not, he focuses his attention on nearby dogs. But for some reason, his tail usually doesn’t wag while we walk. I know he loves to walk because of his reaction before and after. But it seems like he’s just a little nervous while me and him walk. His tail isn’t COMPLETELY in between his legs, but his tail is typically down and somewhat hunched inward (sometimes - not always). It could be because he’s an anxious dog in general - He doesn’t like aggressive behavior from other dogs and he’s extremely gentle.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience about this. He’s an amazing dog - my best friend! It’s just weird. Why would he love walking, yet act anxious on the walks? This isn’t a serious concern as he’s been like this for as long as I’ve known him, but I’m new to reddit and wanted to see if anyone wants to talk about it. Thank you!"

607,[HELP] Advice for reducing barking,dogs,t3_a863kt,2,False,False,a863kt,"I just moved into a triplex and my dog barks every time someone comes into the building. I was trying to just call him to me with treats and make him sit in his kennel or come to me on the couch, but that has stopped working and he is barking with a lot more intensity than before. He no longer barks every single time someone comes in, but the times he does he is really barking, sometimes growling also. 

Honestly I think part of the problem is the people in my building seem to have a lot of short term ""guests"" who just come in the main door, go to their unit, knock and then leave again within 5-10 minutes. Some times they'll have people coming in and out like that for a couple hours. This also means that hes barking when they first come in the building, when they knock and then when they leave again and it is pretty disruptive. 

My neighbors have already complained to the landlord about the barking and I feel lost for what to do since a lot of the advice I see is to ignore it or call him to me but that's not working anymore. I'd really appreciate any other thoughts or advice.

608,[Help] My dog is obsessive and has severe seperation anxiety,dogs,t3_a87mbl,0,False,False,a87mbl,"I rescued my grandmother's dog, and she is roughly 10 yrs old.  We don't know anything about her past, but she has always had a rather fearful side to her which we believe could be from abuse based on how she reacts to certain movements.  I am only watching her temporarily, most likely for another month.
She has grown extremely attached to me to the point where I personally don't believe it is healthy.  She cries if I just go upstairs, she cries at night because she wants to sleep in my bed with me, she cries when I leave as well. When I am holding her she growls at my dad when he comes near.
She reacts very inwards towards others and becomes very stiff and alert.  She does not care to socialize at all with other dogs either. She also does not really know how to play. She just wants to be with me 24/7. It's one thing for her to be a lap dog but is it normal for a dog to be this obsessive? What can I do to help with her severe seperation anxiety? This issue has really put strains on my daily schedules as well as my sleep.
Many people say to just wait until I take her back home but she is not as happy when she is not with me and I want her to be able to live a happy life with my grandmother.  She does love my grandmother more than others but she is obsessed with me.

For some reason, I am nervous to leave our dog with an inexperienced dog sitter but we don’t have many options due to the holiday. Our last sitter fostered and boarded dozens of dogs and was also a vet at banfield animal hospital so I felt more comfortable leaving our pup with her.

We are leaving him for 4 nights. Has anyone had a bad experience on Rover? Any professional/experienced dog sitters in this subreddit that could lend some insight?

618,[DISCUSSION] My dog keeps urinating on the floor.,dogs,t3_a86hoq,6,False,False,a86hoq,"My dog Cassie (half Golden Retriever, half Border Collie) is a bit older than three months but not four months old yet. She seems (fingers crossed) to be fully housebroken for poop.

However, she will still pee on the floor. No signals or anything, she just squats and goes. It's completely healthy-looking urine, no blood or cloudiness or anything, and she doesn't seem to be in pain so I doubt it's a U.T.I. I also doubt she's incontinent because she doesn't pee in her sleep.

I don't think it's psychological either. She doesn't really seem nervous when she urinates on the floor and while she sometimes does it while excited, I doubt being excited is a necessary condition because she pees on the floor plenty of times when not excited. There is no apparent pattern, it's just random; she seems to be past the ""peeing thirty seconds after drinking"" stage, too.

So why do you think she urinates on the floor and how do we stop it (we're already taking her out heaps of times)?"

620,"[Help] Senior deaf dog, is her time nearly up?",dogs,t3_a84kgq,7,False,False,a84kgq,"My family has a beautiful collie/springer spaniel cross who is around 14 now, we rescued her at 4 months old. In the last few years she has gone deaf, has many benign cysts, and has bad arthritis. She's been on steroids for a few months for the arthritis and it has made a big difference in her walking, but she's still incredibly stiff after lying down, and we've had to cut her walks to 15 minutes as she's just not able for more. In the last six months she's developed fecal incontinence, which is quite difficult to deal with, for her and us. She also had an episode of paralysis in her rear legs last week, but I held her up until she managed to walk it off. 
All of this is devastating to watch. I don't think she's in pain, but it's heartbreaking to see her unable to live as she used to. I'm thinking it might be nearly her time, but I don't want to give up on her just because she's old. I suppose I would like advice or reassurance from any of you? "

623,[Help] How do I get my dog certified to become a therapy dog?,dogs,t3_a863hn,4,False,False,a863hn,"My newest dog is 5. He’s a sweetheart and he’s very calm. I think he could go to hospitals and cheer people up, or a nursing home, or sit in a library with kids reading to him. I’d like others to be able to enjoy him. How do I make this happen? And he sheds a lot. Would that disqualify him from going to hospitals?"
624,How do I get my dog to stop barking. [Help],dogs,t3_a82xmi,3,False,False,a82xmi,"Hello, this is my first time posting on this sub, so if this should instead be moved to another subreddit, lmk. Also very long so tl;dr at the bottom. 

So in our family, we have had 3 small dogs at different times. Our oldest, a Yorkie terrier, has been with us for 12 years and is extremely sweet. Around 5 years ago, we got 2 other dogs, both Pekingese. We gave 1 to a family member, and kept the other as a gift for our kids. The Yorkie has always been extremely friendly, and didn’t mind the new member, while the Pekingese has always been very docile, so was fine living with the Yorkie. After being with us for 4 years, someone broke into our backyard and took our Pekingese while my family slept. Our Yorkie has always been very fast and agile, so he wasn’t taken, but the Pekingese, being very docile, was probably taken without much resistance. 

Fast forward to the next day, our kids were heartbroken, because their dog was gone, and were very distraught. Both dogs were chipped, but after several weeks of making signs and calling local shelters to no avail, we gave up. Very quickly we decided to get another dog, and we adopted from a friend a Pomeranian. 

This Pomeranian was a puppy, only around 6 weeks old, and was never very aggressive towards our Yorkie, as our Yorkie wasn’t aggressive towards it. While raising it, I was the primary caregiver; bathing, feeding, and taking this dog for walks. While on walks, he was never aggressive towards dogs we encountered, simple looking at it and continuing walking. 

During the next few months, we’ve had several parties, and during some parties we had a recurring guest who liked to bring her dog as well. Whenever that dog was near our Pomeranian, our Pomeranian would bark NON-STOP. Never getting near it, but continuously barking at it from a few feet away. That other dog is was very friendly as well, not barking back or going near it, but our dogs constant barking was annoying, so we simply separated them and that was it. This happened a couple times afterwards, but we did the same thing. 

Now, fast forward a couple more months, approximately 6 months since our dog was stolen, to this week, and we get a call from the next town over, saying they have our dog. We rush over the next day, and our Pekingese is there, a little fatter then he left us, but it was him. Our kids were ecstatic about this news, as was I. On the drive home, in the back of my mind, I had the thought of how the Pomeranian was going to handle the new dog, and became a bit worried.

Upon coming home, the Pekingese was very happy, wagging its tail and running around, obviously overjoyed to be back home. I was the only one home, so I brought him to the backyard where the other dogs were, and let the inside. I held the Pekingese in my lap and sat down. Letting the other dogs smell him. The Yorkie remembered him, and reacted happy and went about his day. But the Pomeranian smelled him for about 5 seconds, and began barking loudly. 

The Pekingese smelled him and looked at him, but aside from that, more or less ignored the Pomeranian. I had work to do at my desk here at home, so I left them inside and began to work. For the rest of the day, the Pomeranian would NOT STOP BARKING. It would bark for and hour, take a 5 minute break doing something, then look at the other dog, the begin barking again. I got tired of it and put the Pomeranian outside and let the Yorkie and Pekingese stay inside. At night, I put them all outside, fed them in separate bowls, and stayed outside to make sure nothing happened. They all ate their food, but after the Pomeranian finished eating, he began his barking again. They sleep inside, so I had to have them sleep in different rooms for the night, because the Pomeranian wouldn’t stop growling and barking. This proceeded for the next 2 days, with me trying different things I read online, like taking them for walks together and just trying to let them get used to each others smells, but to no avail.

During this, the Pomeranian wouldn’t do anything but bark, while the Pekingese wouldn’t do anything to retaliate. Finally, the Pomeranian started to nip  at the Pekingese’s legs or face, and the Pekingese started to bite and bark back. This has been happening for the last day or so. So my request for you guys is if there is any other ways that we may get the Pomeranian to stop being aggressive towards the Pekingese, or at least to stop barking, because I am getting very close to just buying a muzzle. I can’t stay home all day and keep them separated, nor can I leave them alone in the backyard in fear of them hurting one another. 

tl;dr One of our dogs was stolen and we got another dog to replace him. After 6 months, our old dog showed up, but the replacement dog is extremely aggressive towards the old dog and won’t stop barking and fighting. What do I do?

I have an 8 month old puppy who is in a stage in training where he tests every boundary he has been taught. I know this, and am aware of it. But whenever I am in the moment, I get so angry and frustrated yelling at him for the same things every day. And I know yelling at him isn’t going to teach him, it’s just going to scare him. And I don’t want him to be scared of me; I love him with all my heart. And most importantly I want him to actually learn, and I know getting frustrated or angry isn’t how he is going to learn.  I just seem to loose control and not be able to keep myself in check. So I guess I am asking; is there anyone else out there that struggles with this? And what do you do to keep yourself in check? "

628,[Discussion] What do you do when someone says they want a designer dog?,dogs,t3_a7znr0,169,False,False,a7znr0,"My future brother-in-law recently moved into a small townhome with his other brother. He's a major dog lover, so we've been talking to him a lot about our soon-to-be-puppy (picking up our golden retriever in 3 weeks!). He mentioned he hopes to get a dog in the spring, and that he's looking to get a mini goldendoodle or mini australian labradoodle because of the size and no shedding. 

What do you say in these instances? Do you just let people be ignorant and support BYB? Do you call them out on it and try to tell them why they shouldn't? The situation is a bit tricky because their family dog is a goldendoodle and they love her, so having to tell them that they shouldn't support designer dogs would probably be seen as an attack on their current beloved dog.

629,[Help] I'm in rehab. Should I see my dog over Christmas?

After the holidays I will be spending another 6 months here but will be going home for other various reasons for a few days at a time. Im wondering, for his sake, whether or not it would be a good or bad idea for me to see my dog during those times. Would it be detrimental to his mental and emotional wellbeing for us to be reunited after so long only to leave again? Or would it be better to not see him until I am able to take him home for good?

So I have my beautyful baby Maxxie. His dad is a Rottweiler, and his mom a blue Pittbull.
Maxxie is 3, almost 4 years old. We recieved him as a gift from his parents owner. We didn't plan to have a dog, but soon the little one stole our hearts.
He grew up healthy and happy. The vet checked him up for vaccines and stuff. 
He was pretty normal untill about 20 month ago slowly some weird sores appered in his paws. The vet told us that it was due to walking on heat surfaces, but we only walked him at nigh.  Anyways, the walks were suspended. He recovered with some antibacterial spray the vet gave us. 
He took month but he was healthy again. Then about 14 months ago he developed some weird bald patches in his back. The patches soon became small sores covered in what I though it was fat or oil. Another trip to the vet reveled it was some infection. He gave us some antibiotic and then steroids. That only worked for a while. Then the vet suggested too much fat on Maxxies diet. So we switched onto another brand of dog food. That didn't work.
Antibiotic soap baths? Done. 
So we tried a second opinion. Was Maxxie allergic to pollen? Leaves? Fabric softener? Even tap water?  We stopped the walking again, washed all his clothes, only feed him bottled water and specific food. Nothing.
Im so sad right now. Seeing my poor baby like this. The sores started bleeding. He bites himself and make it worst. 
Third vet opinion: maybe he has fleas. No he doesn't but anyways we bought some liquid to prevent fleas. 
I don't know what else to do. Please, please help.

Background: I moved over the weekend and I’m crashing in my parents’ basement for the next few weeks until my new lease starts. I also started a new job on Monday so my dogs have to stay at home all day. At my last job, they came to work with me and sat under my desk all day every day, I could take them out as much as they wanted and they could play with the other office dogs all day. So naturally they are a little freaked out about all of the sudden changes happening all at once, moving out of their house, in a new place without their mom 40+ hours a week.

Any tips on getting them to stop having potty accidents in my parents’ basement? I have a potty pad out and they blatantly ignore it, popping a squat on the carpet a few feet away from it. 

Also wondering if maybe my girl dog has a UTI? She is peeing two huge pees in the middle of the night when she normally would go all night without having to go to the bathroom. When I take her on walks she stops every 10 feet to pee and nothing comes out (obviously after she emptied her bladder first time she popped a squat). Help!

Potty schedule: 

7am our for a quick pee
7:30-8 long walk for pee/poo
Noon: my dad take them on a walk
Late afternoon: my dad lets them out in the backyard to go pee
7ish home from work: we go on a quick 15 min walk
Bedtime: pee break before bed

This is more than enough potty breaks, so how do I get them to stop peeing?

 My ideal dog would possess the following traits:

* Relatively small and quiet breed (I live alone in a 2 bedroom apartment)

- Calm demeanor, somewhat lower-medium energy level. I don't have the right type of space for a hyper dog, but I'd still like a dog that will have enough energy to go out on hikes if possible.
- Will travel well, as I spend a lot of time traveling back and forth to my GF's place
- Low prey drive (GF has two cats)
 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I don't really have too much of a preference, but I've never liked beagles, schnauzers, or other curly-haired dogs. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands, and to stay with me off-leash.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding I can tolerate, but the less barking the better (apartment), and not a big fan of slobbering dogs.

* Fairly important. There is a dog park at my apartment, and I'd like for the dog to be able to interact off-leash. I also do a lot of hiking, and would definitely enjoy having the ability to have the dog off-leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I'm fine with a dog barking at a door knock, but I would like a dog that will warm up to visitors quickly

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. The rules of my apartment do not allow any dogs that are aggressive.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I think I've covered them

**Lifestyle**

642,[Help] Food changes after life changes?,dogs,t3_a82fdd,1,False,False,a82fdd,"I have a 7 year old female Beagle. She's always been a chow hound - will take as much food as you'll give. Because of this, I've broken her feedings between two meals a day.

I give her half a cup (not an actual Cup, just the cup I use to draw food from the bag) in the morning before I leave, and half a cup in the afternoon when I get home.

She's always devoured her food as soon as I've set it down.

Until last week. Last Thursday I took in a coworker who was about to be homeless and I'm letting him crash on my reading/coffee room's couch for a while. I try to keep her out of that room because she's been known to pull some books and decoratives off of low shelves, and I have some expensive editions, collectables, and such in there, alongside my (religious) altar.

So when my guest is staying in that room, we keep the door closed. She's spent some time around him, however, and they've become quick friends, she lets him pet her and is generally welcoming of him in 'her domain'. But she has seemed a little more alert, and she's spent a good deal of time watching that closed door.

However, she's been eating much less since he came. When I feed her in the morning, I've been coming back to an untouched or half-eaten bowl, and she'll eat the rest later on, without prompting me for more, like she sometimes does by pawing the bowl- which she normally does when I get home and don't feed her immediately.

Any ideas? Thanks!"
643,[help] Allergic to new puppy? But I already own one dog? Something else?,dogs,t3_a829t6,22,False,False,a829t6,"I'm lowkey crying (not just the potential allergies). Two days ago my family and I got our Alaskan malamute boy Luka. We already have a Rottweiler named Rita.

I thought it was just because my parents were cleaning and maybe the dust got in my system.  Next day Luka comes home and I still have the symptoms. We suspect the Christmas hyacinths so we place them in a room where I rarely go to. Still got the symptoms. The o.ly change is Luka. 

Can other breeds cause allergic reactions? I never got any from Rita. I'm devastated at the thought of rehoming him. It's only been couple of days but he's been doing so good and Rita and him get along so great."
644,[help] am I doing enough for my dog?,dogs,t3_a826om,4,False,False,a826om,"I adopted my first dog last summer. She’s a 4 year old pit mix and I love her so much.

645,[help] mostly housetrained dog suddenly having repeated accidents,dogs,t3_a80cpt,4,False,False,a80cpt,"My dog comes to work with me (a retail shop).  Yesterday she had 3 accidents.  She had been accident free for at least a couple of weeks.  I panicked and took her to the  vet but the urinalysis checked out fine.

The only thing that has changed this week is that I had a trainer come on Tuesday morning and he taught me clicker training.  I've been doing a lot of that especially with the door opening (click as door opens, treat).  Tuesday she got a ton of treats during the session (she's only 6 lbs) so I changed over to using part of her morning kibble.  I didn't notice that she was drinking more water.

646,[Help] Rough first fostering experience. Am I asking too much?,dogs,t3_a7z7aj,9,False,False,a7z7aj,"This is a little long, so TLDR: My SO and I are finishing up fostering a dog for the first time, and it's been a nightmare. Are we being crazy and expecting too much from the foster organization?

SO: My partner and I have been wanting a dog for ages, and we finally moved into a place with a nice backyard and a reasonable pet deposit. We were a little nervous about going full commitment to a dog, so when an opportunity came up to foster a ~1 year old beagle mix it seemed like a great idea.

From the start, though, it has just been an incredibly stressful and un-fun experience. We work opposite schedules generally, and there are only 2-3 days a week where the dog would need to be crated for at most 8 hours (we are sometimes able to come back for a walk at lunch, but not always). We were told by the rescue that the dog's previous foster worked similar hours so it would not be an issue. From the start, however, whenever we left her alone she would be obviously stressed out and break out of her crate. The rescue gave us some info on crate training but after a few weeks of that there was no improvement and the dog was getting even more stressed out. It is also worth noting that the dog only had these problems when we left, otherwise she was perfectly content to sleep in her crate and went in voluntarily very often. She howls incessantly during the day, according to our neighbor. When the rescue got us a gate and suggested we try gating her in a room, she tore down the sturdy gate. She has scratched the hell out of exit doors in our house (the front/back doors she sees us walk out of).

Some of the chaos she's caused when alone is just inexperience. Every time we come home and find something chewed up, it's a new lesson in puppy-proofing the house, and that's fine and to be expected. But the rescue kept blowing off the clear symptoms (not necessarily officially diagnosable behavior) of separation anxiety. We understand that many rescue dogs go through a decompression phase and that the amount of time can vary drastically, but this dog is incredibly stressed out when left alone and even if it is a temporary problem, she deserves help getting through it. We are more than happy to help her but we have never done this before and need help ourselves as we do not know how to approach the problem. Our inexperience and need for help should any issues arise was made abundantly clear when we were asked to foster (the president of the rescue asked us to help out, which we were happy to do since we were considering it anyway). No matter how much we asked for help, we rarely get an answer.

We had previously looked at adopting an adorable malamute mix with separation anxiety, and decided against it because we thought our first dog having anxiety issues would be a bad idea as we were not confident about our ability to properly handle it without any experience. Again, I totally get that it's way too early to diagnose anything, but after weeks of dealing with howling and scratching and chewing and getting silence, if anything, from the rescue I was ready to go insane.

It really just comes down to the lack of communication - and this is where my main question is. What sort of help do you expect from a rescue organization when fostering a dog from them? I know they're probably dealing with a million other things and may not have time to walk a pair of panicking first-time foster parents through how to handle anxiety symptoms, but I feel like we were crazy for asking for help so many times. We had larger problems getting things they said they would provide for us - a lead for our backyard, harness to help with her pulling, some more durable chew toys - but again I have no idea if those are things a rescue will typically provide or if they're supposed to come out of our pocket. The rescue told us they would be providing anything we needed but the only things they have actually delivered on are a gate and food.

Are we crazy and needy? Was it just a shitty situation, having two people who couldn't have someone home at all times handling a dog who hated being alone?"

648,[Breeds] Whippet vs. Border Terrier,dogs,t3_a83nyt,8,False,False,a83nyt,"Hello r/dogs! I’d appreciate some advice on picking the right breed for my partner and I. I filled out the breed questionnaire a few days ago but only got one response. I’m on mobile otherwise I would have copied and pasted.

After a lot of research and lengthy discussion, my partner and I think that either a Whippet or a Border Terrier might be right for us. We’d love to hear some opinions about these two breeds with regard to our lifestyle. In summary - we are a moderately active couple living in a one bedroom apartment. We have multiple parks around us and enjoy revolving our life around our dog! I go into a lot more detail in the breed questionnaire.

We keep tossing up between the two (very different!) breeds. We don’t want to start contacting breeders before we are absolutely sure on the breed we would like. In saying that, registered Whippet breeders are a LOT more common in Australia (100+ Whippet breeders vs. &lt;40 Border Terrier breeders). But that shouldn’t be the deciding factor.

I’d love to hear your thoughts if you have had experience with either breed, or if you have any other breed suggestions we are very open to hearing them. You should be able to find all the information that you need in the breed questionnaire (my post history), but feel free to ask further questions. Thanks in advance!"
649,[help] Dog refuses to poop on a leash.,dogs,t3_a7zwne,2,False,False,a7zwne,"Zero is a 6 your old Great Dane, lab mix. He has lived in the house with access to a backyard for 5 years and has never had to poop on a leash before. He is completely fine on walks and marks everywhere, walks are actually his favorite part of the day. However, no matter how often or how long I walk him, he will not poop while on a leash.


I just moved to an apartment complex so there is no way I can take him off. There's no dog park nearby that I can go to to let him loose, so I don't really know what to do at this point. He gets fed only at night and hopes that in the morning he'll have to go bad enough that he'll just go on our walks. When I was feeding him twice a day, he would poop on my rugs in the house while I was at work.  He has never once had an accident in the house before this, and I know that he feels really bad about it.


I'm kind of at a loss. I walk him 15 to 30 minutes per walk and about 5 walks a day. We go all over the complex, even to the parts where it's mainly trees and no people or cars are around. His recall is 50/50 so I don't feel comfortable taking him off. I've tried a regular leash and am now using an extendable (I know everyone hates these, pls just spare me) in hopes that he feels less ""forced"" to be near me.


Does anyone have any advice? He feels bad. I feel bad. We all feel bad. Thank you. "

655,[Fluff] Love your dogs (And/Or your cats... I guess... ;) ),dogs,t3_a7ueeg,1,False,False,a7ueeg,"2016 was without a doubt the worst year of my life. I nearly lost my Mum to Cancer. End of a 10 year relationship. ""Homeless"" for a moment (Not truely. I was in a hostel, so thankful for that). And June that year marked the start of a 19 month saga whereby my ex did some shady things and essentially stole my dogs. 

It cost me $10,000 in legal fees to get them back. But worse, it cost me 19 months without my two beloved rescues, in a deep pit of depression. That's all I want to say about that (unless anyone wants to ask me stuff. I'm an open book).

But in March this year, I got them back. My Lab, and my Husky are home. I have legal bills to pay, and I'm ""behind in life"" because of the stress and anxiety of that situation and the time I devoted to fighting for them.

But they're home. You can forget about everything sad I just told you. That's why this is [Fluff]. My dogs fixed me. They are my world. The worst days I'll have going forward won't be half as bad as they would have been without them. They are the joy of my life.

I know if you're on this thread, there's a good chance you feel the same way. But promise me you'll never neglect them. Never take them for granted. Never look at them as a burden. They'll never ask for more from you then food and love. 

As bad as my situation was (and it was bad), I consider myself to be the luckiest person in the world. My dogs were taken from me. It was as if they were dead, but then I got them back. Very few people can call themselves that lucky.

I had a few good friends who lost their dogs this year. And I'm sure that's happened to many of you this year, or in the past as well. And if you have a pet, it will happen in the future. There's no softening that blow. So to anyone who is going through that loss, or know what it feels like, I wish you well, especially at this time of the year.

If you're near a dog right now, hug it for me, and for yourself. :) I am."
656,"[Discussion] If your dog has unexplained seizures, check his/her dog food for Rosemary extract",dogs,t3_a7kg4q,242,False,False,a7kg4q,"Both of my dogs were on a diet of Blue Buffalo kibble. My youngest started having grand mal seizures around 1.5 years old. I took him to the vet and they concluded that he has epilepsy. They wanted to put him on medication for it, but I knew that the meds had bad side effects. 

His seizures were still coming pretty far apart and never more than 30 seconds so I did some research and found that spices like rosemary, sage, and fennel could trigger seizures. Lo’ and behold, all the Blue Buffalo kibble and treats had rosemary extract in the ingredients list. 

I started looking for a kibble that didn’t contain rosemary, which is surprisingly difficult! I’d say 95% of the kibbles I researched contained rosemary. Taste of the Wild doesn’t, however, and since I’ve been feeding him that, he hasn’t had a single seizure. We’re just about a year seizure-free! 

Edit: I’m not trying to pretend to be a scientist and say that rosemary is definitely the cause of your dog’s seizures. I know this is anecdotal, but it’s something that’s worked for me, and rosemary is a trigger in some dogs. It may not end your dog’s seizures, but it’s an option to look into. "

There are people who are genuinely mean inside and I'm wondering if dogs experience the same to varying degrees?

I might be anthropomorphizing. I have a Shiba who's been pretty stereotypical of an aloof and independent Shiba. I know we're not supposed to call our dogs jerks but he really is sometimes. One time when he was much younger, I made a horrible training mistake where I was giving him frozen peanut butter kongs to eat while crated to help him adjust to being crated. The mistake was me taking his kong away before he was done because I put so much PB in there and through some trust/exchange exercises, he lets me take his treat without growling at me. 

When this was happening, he had this weird look in his eye, like an upward angry warning glare right before he would growl. The closest I can compare it to is like a wolf stalking its prey? 

Lately I've been training him to stay out of the kitchen because he's been pushing his boundaries and whenever I tell him no, he gives me the same kind of glare instead of his usual puppy eyes. I don't know if I'm uncomfortable because I was so shocked that he snapped/growled at me the first time. My husband says he senses weakness (I spoil him).

The past 2 years she has been suffering from kidney failure and a progressing heart murmur. It's long beem to the point where she's needing a diaper 24/7. Of course, her personality still showed, until I went away to college. She started sleeping more and more and eating less and less, up until these past 2 weeks where she stopped eating entirely. I feel personally responsible because I left. I feel as though I caused her to give up. 

I'm also worried about our other poodle who was raised by Scully. Scully was a breeding dog before we adopted her and she came packed with motherly instincts. Our toy poodle, Zoe, was adopted so she could have a puppy to raise. I'm worried Zoe is going to become heartbroken. I know I certainly am.

&amp;nbsp;  
  
Last night we visited the neighbor and surprisingly the old pup was outside his front door sleeping on a blanket. Up to that point we were still trying to determine whether it was a good idea for us to take him. Once we saw the dog's condition up close we decided right then and there (warning: not for sensitive souls): https://imgur.com/a/5F5KZrD

Keep in mind that my neighbor was home at the time. We were furious but we needed to get the surrender form signed so we restrained ourselves. After a very short conversation (we found out his name is Chico) this asshole neighbor signed the form and we brought Chico to our car. We had blankets and the heater on blast for him. He was scared but immediately calmed down when we started petting and soothing him.

Once we got home we set up a pen in our kitchen, with lots of blankets, space heater, and a bed for him to rest. He started snoring. It's weird but that was incredibly gratifying. A few pics of Chico peeking up at me, then being a snoozeberry, and also our two other dogs Kulfi and Bonnie being curious: https://imgur.com/a/sV8FQ8Q  

Later in the night we found that the dog's condition was pretty bad. I had details here earlier but suffice it to say that we discovered he was suffering from debilitating neurological and physical issues. Chico is a tough doggy though. This morning we took him to the emergency vet. It now seemed that euthanization may be the most merciful option. The Banfield nurses were amazing and took us in immediately. They examined him, corroborated the neurological issues, and said that keeping him alive would be difficult and it wasn't clear that the dog was fully aware of his surroundings anymore.

So, we made the decision to give him the long sleep he badly needed. Chico was a sweet boy who deserved better. While I'm not really sure what I'm feeling right now, at the very least I'm happy that his last night here was spent indoors in a cozy bed with our other pups as his friends, instead of out in the cold.

We rescued an old boy this fall. He's an 11 years young JRT/Rat terrier, and he is equal parts insane, a little misbehaved, and not super cuddly. He's mostly good - knows basic commands, does not root through trash or chew. He is a little funny around people and takes a while to settle down. He cries a low whine if we are busy. He hates being cuddly. He does not play with toys. We've had issues where he is aggressive with us. We're doing the best we can, learning how to avoid situations and change behaviors. It's getting better. But I think this is as good as it will get. 

Just this morning I was organizing his records and saw that we had overlooked a pretty critical detail (actually, the rescue failed to tell us, but neither here nor there). He'd been adopted before. In summer. And then was returned a month later. The notes read ""unrealistic expectations."" And I look at this dog who sometimes gets growly and grumpy, and who won't go near a lap, and... I get it. I do. He's not your ideal. 

Owning a dog was nothing like I thought it would be. But I will not give up on him. Even if he never cuddles, if he never plays fetch...at the end of the day, I am still giving this grumpy old dog a safe place, and I think he and I are both better off because of it. 

I won't give up on you, old grump. &lt;3"
669,[Fluff] First Year of Dog Ownership - Detailed Expenses and Thoughts!,dogs,t3_aac9fh,35,False,False,aac9fh,"#Background
After 20+ years of wanting a dog, we were finally in a place where we had the time and the money to afford a dog. After following various rescues for several years, we knew that we wanted to adopt.

A lot of people have misconceptions about rescue dogs and rescue organizations. We chose a rescue that was foster-based, meaning all dogs were put in foster homes with real families. All dogs are screened at the city animal control for temperament. We liked this rescue because they had a thorough vetting process for both fosters and adopters, and they also had a 2 week 'trial adoption' period to help find the perfect fit.

Bodie was the first dog we saw through the rescue. He lived in a foster home with 2 grade school aged children, and 2 other dogs. We fell in love and adopted Bodie in January of 2018.

#Thoughts
**Challenges**

* He's not *perfect*. It took us a while to come to terms with the fact that he'd never be perfect. Then again - what dog truly is? He is a rescue and likely grew up on the streets. He is sometimes uncomfortable with loud children and especially large men. We have had to invest a LOT of time and money into training.
* Puppy blues are real. He wasn't even a puppy, but for the first few months, he had to be let out on the hour for potty breaks and he HATED his crate. It was hard adjusting to simply being responsible for another living creature and learning to plan our days/weeks in advance. Our schedules are sometimes like Tetris and it truly requires good communication.
* Poop. So much poop. When did he poop? What was the consistency of his poop? The amount of poop we talk about on a daily basis is absurd, but it truly is one of the best way to assess the health of a dog. We had to get comfortable with it REAL fast. There were mistakes made with holes in poop bags. 
* We live in a major metro city and don't have a yard. Walking around in the winter sucks. Walking around in the winter with a dog sucks even more. Prepare to spend 20 minutes each morning putting on jackets and boots for the both of you, and prepare to be pulled on ice for an entire city block because he sees a squirrel and your neighbors didn't salt their side walks.
* Holy hell vet costs are expensive. Who knew that just a basic annual check up with vaccines and heartworm/tick medication would run us well over $500? Where are people paying $200 for vet visits a year?!

**Wins**

* His excitement when we come home makes it all worth it.
* Seeing him blossom and his 'firsts'. His first time playing with a toy. His first time eating a bully stick (and learning that it's not a weapon he will be hit with). His first time asking for belly rubs. His first time jumping into the lake. His first time getting a Christmas present.
* We truly lucked out with a dog that does NOT counter surf, chew things, destroy things, or test any boundaries. You could tape a piece of paper across a doorway and he would cry because it's an impassible barrier.
* He is SO smart and picks up tricks in an instant. We started nosework classes to help build his confidence and to give him something to do in the colder months. We hope to be those crazy dog parents that compete with their dogs in competitions someday.
* Although he's too hyperactive for doggie daycare, he does great with dogs and is superbly tolerant of puppies! We hope to foster dogs in the future, when we have a bigger home.
* Take advantage of local dog groups on Facebook/Reddit and breed specific groups/rescue alumni groups to build a network of dog friends. Not only is it great for play dates, but it's also great to have a network of support when you need to vent. We met many friends this way!

#Expenses
[This year, we spent a whopping $6,150.34](https://i.imgur.com/8uFQjUK.png). Note: we live in a major metro area (Chicago). I will be the first to admit that I am dog obsessed (he's basically my hobby) and spend more on the dog than myself and my partner combined. We are lucky enough to be able to budget and afford doggie luxuries.

[For next year, I'm predicting that it will be closer to $3,000 - $3,500, or $270 - 300 a month](https://i.imgur.com/UBKHY04.png). Next year's expenses will primarily be food, supplements, vet, some boarding, and training. 

If we were to truly minimize costs, I would still expect to budget $1,500 at a MINIMUM to cover basic food and vet costs for a dog.

[Our spend by percentage](https://i.imgur.com/AR3U9eZ.png):

* 'Startup/non-consumable' costs were pretty big for us - about $2k. It included several expensive items like waterproof couch covers to protect from potty accidents/hair on our nicer furniture, a storage bench for all his toys, 2 air purifiers to help our allergies, and a hard crate and soft crate. We spent a LOT on toys, including a CleverPet hub and several enrichment toys. Luckily, he tends to preserve his toys, so these costs will not be incurred next year and should be pretty minimal. 
* 'Service' costs were the largest category, and consisted of boarding, daycare, vet visits, health insurance, and rescue events that we attended. We started traveling less for work in the summer and have more opportunities for work from home, so boarding and daycare will likely drop next year. He started becoming more reactive/protective towards men in early May and we did some training sessions in August to help with his behavior. We would like to continue his training and nosework so costs may stay the same overall. 
* 'Consumable' costs were pretty low in comparison to the first two. We tried several food brands before switching to lamb kibble at Costco, which is pretty cost effective. We also tried several treats at the beginning of ownership but have settled on primarily peanut butter, pumpkin, dental chews, and bully sticks. We buy these on Costco in bulk to help reduce costs. 

If you read this essay, thank you. Questions are welcome!

tl;dr: Dog is expensive. Dog is worth it. 

tl;dr2: I would budget at least $1.5k for a dog for basic expenses, but expect it to increase drastically if you include boarding/daycare and training.

670,"[fluff] My golden asks to go in the back garden, then does just one bark to provoke the neighbour’s dogs that always bark at him while we walk along the street.",dogs,t3_aa8dzg,14,False,False,aa8dzg,"My golden is not a barker. He barks mostly when he’s scared. Or very, very excited. A few weeks ago he started a odd behavior: he would ask to go in the back garden, immediately rush next to the corner, and do a big bark. Just one. At first I thought he was trying to bark at our neighbor’s cat. Then I thought he was answering at dogs barking(we live in a neighborhood where almost everyone keep their dogs outside, even when it’s freezing or very warm. It’s not my case!) Then yesterday I went outside with him, and he obviously barked at nothing. There was silence. Then neighbor’s three dogs suddenly answered, very very angrily. He gets revenge!! While we walk I taught him not to answer or pay attention at dogs barking, as he was becoming fence reactive. Now he’s much better. But he gets revenge while he’s in his garden, provoking these dogs to bark like crazy! We obviously try to block him from this behavior as he got very obsessed. But I found that very cute. "
671,[Help] My mom and sister adopted a pitbull and I fear they might be in over their heads,dogs,t3_aaclll,41,False,False,aaclll,"They adopted an American Pitbull Terrier, he is only 1.5 years old and he came home from a shelter yesterday. 

I am prepared for downvotes because I am going to discuss the potential for aggression in the APBT breed. 

[This old comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3e4rit/_/ctc9tpv?context=1000) was very informative about the breed. If I'm wrong to trust the sources, correct me. 

Anyways, my mom and sister have never owned a dog before, and I'm not sure if they will be able to do proper training, as already they're telling him conflicting messages.. but maybe they can fix that. They have one free training class (haven't gone yet) but I don't know if they'll do more. I hate to say this, but I'm genuinely afraid of this dog. And I know it might make it worse, but idk how to not feel this way.

They just got him yesterday but so far I've noticed following. I just wonder if they're signs of aggression or what: 

•According to his records at the shelter, he sustained an injury on his leg and some bite marks on his chest. He has scarring and his fur has some blood stains that won't go away. My family assumes he was attacked.

•He met another dog. They sniffed eachother for a minute and it seemed good. But after that he began growing and trying to get closer towards the other dog. My sister was holding him by the collar and he made choking sounds. The dog left and he returned to normal.

•My sister touched the funny looking part of his mouth area and he opened his mouth to show his teeth and turned towards her. He stopped when she kind of yelled no.

•Meeting the neighbor dogs through a fence. He doesn't really bark, but he started to make weird growlish sounds after a second and my sister had to hold him back and tell him no.


He doesn't listen very well yet. Is it possible for him to be an easy going safe dog? My sister wants to take him to a dog park and I just imagine a disaster. I don't know how to not be afraid, which might be a separate issue. Is there any recommended tips for dealing with potential aggression? Training tips?

Also, just a disclaimer, I don't have a personal vendetta against the breed, I think they deserve love and happy lives. I just think the dog might need very good training where the owners acknowledge the potential for aggression.. my family currently believes he has the same chance of aggression as any other dog. Idk, I just don't think that's a responsible way to go about it. If I'm wrong, correct me.. Thanks."
672,[RIP] Roxy,dogs,t3_aae9iv,4,False,False,aae9iv,"A few days ago I posted about next steps for cancer. It started last weekend, we noticed my best friend roxy started to have a bit of a gut. At 7 years old i brushed it off that she’s getting older and she’s just got a tummy. Wednesday night she started breathing funny, she snores so it didn’t raise much of an eyebrow so I let it go. Thursday it continued, almost light a sigh/stretch sound when she would exhale. Friday I began to get extremely worried and brought her to the ER. They did X-ray and make me wait 2 hours for results. I’m crying st this point and roxy looks at me with these eyes “it’ll be ok dad” and gives me a kiss. They come back with results and say they can’t see anything and need to ultrasound but couldn’t ultrasound her as their techs are only there certain days. They said I need to get the ultrasound done to see what is going on in her abdomen as it didn’t feel right. Saturday I brought her to another hospital and they did ultrasound and saw a mass. They also saw fluid around her lungs. I said do everything you need to do. They removed 1/2 liter of fluid from around the lungs, went into surgery, to then tell
Me it is at the base of the mesentery gland and could not be removed. Fear and so much emotion overcame my wife and I. I felt helpless. They needed to keep my roxy doodle overnight after the surgery. I called Sunday, and was told she was nauseous and they gotta keep her longer, maybe I can get her Monday Xmas eve. 5 pm Sunday the doctor called saying she’d like to send roxy home. Emotion and tears of happiness filled me as I could have my bub home for Xmas. The doctor said keep an eye on her breathing hopefully fluid doesn’t come back, but we need to wait a few days to find out what the fluid is from and what the mass is. Doodle had a nice Xmas, I went to store Xmas eve buying her lots of canned food and toys. All the above. I stayed home 12/26 to keep an eye on her breathing and make sure she didn’t lick stitches. My wife and I made plans to be positive and not leave roxy home alone and always be around family to be careful to watch her and make sure nothing ruptures, as well as make her life more enjoyable and not lonely when we work. I began to feel positivity maybe the mass isn’t cancer, maybe the fluid won’t come back, if it does I’ll get her on a diuretic, if it’s cancer well do chemo. I didn’t care if we went broke for my roxydoodle. I get a call at 2pm, it’s lymphoma, and it’s also effected a node in her chest cavity. I began to have a breakdown and fear for everything as it’s official.  Fast forward 9pm 12/26 night, her breathing rapidly increases, I say maybe she’s in pain and gave her s painkiller. My wife stays up til 1 am. Wakes me up, her breathing was over 60 breaths per minute and shallow. We decide we won’t take the chance and even if it’s pain, let’s bring her to the ER. Er does a scan, roxy has over 1 liter around her lung, and her belly is getting even bigger. Tears spewing out of my eyes, I can’t put roxy through this pain anymore. To drain it again and have her fill up struggling to breathe her again! She didn’t eat much yesterday either and it was all looking so bad. We make the decision for her own good we don’t want her to struggle anymore. I lost my absolute best friend 12/27 at 2:20 am. I’ve never had a connection like with roxy. She looks st my wife when they inject her, with those same eyes “I love you mom”. And lays down. Her breaths are less and less and I keep kissing her and telling how good of s girl she is. I’m honestly broken and lost a huge part of me this morning. A part I will never have back. I miss my roxy doodle. she was the one who proposed to my wife with the ring. She was there on our wedding day. She truly loved us more than herself, and never would leave our side. I miss her so much and lost part of my heart today. I hope you don’t think I betrayed you rox, I’m so sorry and this was the best 7 years I’ve had with you"
673,[Help] My dog's health is deteriorating and I'm losing my mind,dogs,t3_aag8c9,4,False,False,aag8c9," 

I have an 11 year old King Charles Spaniel. He’s the absolute love of my life. I’m not going to waste time describing this breed to you, but they are the most wonderful dogs there could ever be. 

I got him shortly after my mother died and the bond we’ve created is something I could never picture myself living without. Nevertheless, in the past year or so, he started getting more and more health problems. He can still see very well, but his eyes need daily care and medication. He’s also taking daily medication for his heart disease, which is untreatable and degenerative. To top it all off, we recently discovered that he also has a chronic issue in his spine, that sometimes causes him pain, so he’s losing some of his mobility, meaning that he needs special dog stairs to get up and down the bed. It also means no more belly rubs, no more getting picked up, because he whines and yelps. We’re still testing the medication for that, as we don’t want him to be drugged all the time. Surgery is not an option for neither of his issues.

I am terrified. I always knew that he wasn’t going to be here forever, but it’s getting closer and I don’t know what to do. I still think (or hope) he has at least a couple of years to be with us as he’s still a very active dog for his age, still playful and curious.

But I can’t help but think that I won’t know what to do with myself after he’s gone. We tried getting another dog a couple of months ago, but I couldn’t get attached to him at all and the guilt that I felt because it was like I was trying to replace my dog while he’s still alive was overwhelming. So we ended up rehoming the second dog to another family so he could be happy and loved as he deserved.

I am rational enough to know that this may seem overly dramatic for some people, but for the life of me, I love my dog more than anything in this world and it’s breaking my heart because there’s nothing more that I can do to help him. He’s been by my side, my sole comfort during some very difficult things in my life, so losing my right arm seems like a better choice than not having him with me. It’s selfish and self destructive, but I don’t know how to control myself.

If anyone has any advice or has gone through something similar, please help me. I’m getting desperate and I don’t have anyone close to me that can relate.

Thank you! "

Whenever he gives me puppy eyes, I melt. And he does this almost every day when he wants to cuddle (which is almost all the time).

I’m convinced my dog placed some sort of brainwashing chip in my brain because it must be weird to think a dog is *this* cute. Does anyone else feel this way about their fur baby(ies)?

678,[fluff] lost my dog's leash whilst on walk - little man did me proud,dogs,t3_aa0u90,72,False,False,aa0u90,"Went on a looooong old walk with my boy this morning along a canal path. It's generally pretty empty save a few bikes and other dog walkers. He's reliable off leash but I always hook him up when we pass roads/other animals/on leash dogs as he still gets excited over exciting things. 

Anyway, we hit the 6 mile mark and were coming up to a road so I called him back to me, reached for the leash around my neck... And it wasn't there! 

We went back on ourselves to where I last used it but I just couldn't find it. I decided to head to the nearest pub where I knew they had dogs. We ended up walking over 2 miles past fields of cows and sheep, cyclists and a very excited puppy on leash and my boy stayed by my side the whole time! 

It was like the most intense training session EVER! I tried to limit my commands so I didn't overload him, but it was like he knew something was up so was super responsive to everything! Walking next to me past livestock, sitting next to me while cyclists went by and waiting to be released to greet the puppy. 

I WAS SO PROUD 

Gave him lots of roast potatoes when we got to the pub. 

It was great. 

Edit: here he is early on on our walk&gt; https://imgur.com/a/D1ZJtvK

Edit 2: Just in response to a couple of comments &gt; We live in the UK where dogs are only required to be on lead in areas where there is a specific by-law. Because of this we don't have dedicated off-leash areas, like dog parks, and we're expected to share public space. This means if your dog is going to get any time off leash, it will be in public space. This doesn't mean dogs are running everywhere, but that parks, woodlands etc will be used by dog owners to exercise off leash. I do my best to be a responsible dog owner and ensure he is under control at all times. We've worked really hard to get to a point where he could walk off leash. Spent over a year using a long line etc. Even put him back on it when he started scavenging a few months back. Although today turned out ok, it could have been worse and I've learnt my lesson about bringing a spare lead. But, DAMN did he impress me. "

681,Situation [Help],dogs,t3_aafl2z,1,False,False,aafl2z," So, I have two dogs, one is a cream retriever (Moses) and one is a french bulldog (Chip) (tremendous size difference obviously). Usually they're best buds, constantly together, play together, sleep together, always by each others sides. Just recently, within the past 3 or 4 days my retriever, the much bigger dog, seems to have become deathly afraid of my french bulldog. Whenever they are both in the house Moses will run away and hide from Chip. He'll cower in a corner or run up to my room and refuse to go downstairs. Moses will be on edge, watching to see if Chip is coming, and if he does, he runs to my side and cries while I pet him. I'm really not sure what to do nor do I really know what started this. Of course they rough house around and maybe Chip had bit him too hard one time but regardless this kind of behavior is very odd for them. This had just caused a general disturbance around the house because we have to be separated with both of them and I personally am a bit afraid to leave them alone together because if Moses gets too afraid, I wouldn't be surprised if he attacked Chip, which, due to the size difference, could end badly. Any help would be greatly appreciated! "
682,[help] potential partially torn CCL,dogs,t3_aafcxc,2,False,False,aafcxc,"My 5 year old female pit bull has been limping for a month. She has had limps before (extremely active dog/extremely long and strenuous hikes) and x-rays were negative for any breaks or torn ligaments. She usually gets back to 100% within a week. This time she was still favoring her leg after a month. While the limp has improved in the course of a month she would still favor it at times.

&amp;#x200B;

I took her to the vet today and he thinks that it might be a partial ligament tear of her CCL. He gave me Gabapentin and Vetprofen. After reading up on the former, not sure if the side effects are worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

He said that if I wanted to get an x-ray it should be under sedation. I'm reluctant to do this.

  
If it is indeed a partial torn CCL, what is the best course of action? My initial research indicates that surgery, while not necessary, helps to prevent further injury to the knee area. It also helps to prevent potential issues from the change in gait to the other legs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty blown about this because I consider my dog to be invincible physically. She's tough and hardy, never shows signs of being in pain, a sentiment shared by the vet. Like I said before, she is very active and in remarkable shape. I would hate for this limp to be permanent.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with surgery, it doesn't seem like a 100% recovery is possible.

I've read a lot of material on the subject matter but I have some questions that cropped up tonight and unfortunately my vet's office is closed(plus I'm fairly certain my questions don't count as urgent). 

Quick background: I have a litter of 5 Great Dane puppies, 10 days old. They're all hearty little sucklers, and momma dog has been doing a good job thus far. I have been tracking their weights and they're all steadily gaining weight(with an average gain of 1.5lbs in the last week). Now from everything I read they should still have their eyes shut and not be all that mobile, except half of them have opened their eyes today and 2 of them are already holding themselves up completely and walking(not well but definitely walking not crawling). Is this okay? 

TLDR: My puppies seem to be developing faster than expected, there are no signs that any are sick or unwell in anyway. Just wanted to check that this was okay."

685,[Help] Is Children's Robitussin DM Honey flavor safe for dogs?,dogs,t3_aad04w,8,False,False,aad04w,"My dog has an occasional cough and congestion that the vet thinks is related to seasonal allergies but may be the start of a collapsing trachea. Since it's infrequent she told us to give her half of a child's dose of robitussin dm every six hours as needed. I've been to 3 pharmacies and I couldn't find any robitussin that wasn't just for adults or children. So I bought children's robitussin dm honey flavor and was going to give her 5ml when she needs it (this is half of the children aged 10-12 dose). 

TL:DR; I just want to make sure that none of the flavoring ingredients are harmful for canine consumption, such as the anhydrous citric acid. For reference she is a 13 year old, 7 pound chihuahua."

The other is now extremely pregnant, like really really, and I have an appointment for her to get spayed on Monday. I feel very conflicted. I know there are so many dogs needing homes already, they will be anesthetized during the surgery, and we do not need like 8 dogs to take care of. We are scraping by financially, have an out of town family trip planned for mid-February, and have so many things to figure out regarding our son’s school and medical needs.

687,[help] I am dogsitting my friend's non-housebroken dog,dogs,t3_aacuuf,4,False,False,aacuuf,"I am dog-sitting my friend's little 5yr old dachshund mix.  I already knew that my friend was not the most responsible with her dog. She leaves him home all day and doesn't have him walked. I have never seen her walk the dog and I used to live next door to her. I also vaguely knew he wasn't completely potty trained. 

This dog is completely NOT housebroken. He's peed on my dog's bed, my bed, my couch, and in my dog's crate. He sees furniture/carpets as places to relieve himself I think. I texted her to ask about the dog's potty skills and she said, ""well you can't leave him loose in a room."" She told me to keep him in his crate which makes me sad.

 I let him run around the yard for a bit, but it's too cold outside for him to stay there and he seems pretty scared of it. He's in his crate, which is more like a carrier container and really, really small.  

I am just about to take him on a walk, but he is really poorly trained and pretty reactive to just about everything. I feel like I just don't know what to do at all. 

To be honest, this is changing my opinion of my friend. Her dog seems pretty neglected and untrained. Last night, she told me it was fine to put him in his crate at 7 pm and take him out at 9 am. That's 14 hours in the crate! 

How do I handle this? she only gave me two pee pads, which I don't think he knows how to use. I guess I will be trying to let him out every hour? I am really at a loss about what to do. "

Is it realistic to pass her off as a Black and Tan coonhound for rental purposes in an apartment? Has anyone ever been asked to have proof of their dogs breed when renting? If so, would vet records that say she is a coonhound be sufficient? 
Please no moral debate. She is well trained and behaved and I am in a tough situation right now and with a jacked up credit score I can probably only rent an apartment at this time. "
689,"[Breed] Help my find my perfect dog breed, please!",dogs,t3_aah97p,0,False,False,aah97p,"**Introduction**

**1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

This is not my first dog. I grew up with German Shepherds, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and Australian Shepherds.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

My family always went through breeders in the past, I like the idea of a rescue dog, I’m open to either.

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

Here’s where things get complicated. I teach a lot of theatre/drama/dance to children and would like a “theatre dog”, one that is absolutely great with kids. I’m a trauma survivor, and a relatively petite sized human, so the idea of a larger dog who might make strangers think twice before approaching sounds ideal. I want a dog that wants to be with me and can jump into my family. Must be trainable and bonus points if I can get this dog to join the kids onstage for shows &lt;3 I also have large birds (Who have been able to hold their own with all previous dogs) so a dog that can quickly learn to leave the birds alone would be safest. (They are never out together unsupervised)

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I like the idea of larger dogs, Rhodesian sized and up, but I’m not opposed to a dog I can carry if we think, personality wise, it’ll be a better fit. I’ve got a big yard, and a decent sized living space. 

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Obedience for sure, agility could be fun (I did that with my Aussie). A dog that is comfortable with children and activity around without necessarily feeling the need to join in is a great fit. Oh and I love a good hike! 

**Care Commitments**

**6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

I would like to take my dog to work (Theatre) with me and spend a good about of time with my dog. 

**7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

I walk about 1 1/2 hours per day already, could do more. 

**8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

A couple times a week myself, groomers monthly isn’t out of the question. 

**Personal Preferences**

**9) What size dog are you looking for?**

I love larger dogs, but, again, not opposed to a smaller one if the personality is right.

**10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

The more quiet, the better. Shedding is fine, slobber makes me kind of sad, but I'm willing to put up with it if all else works.

**11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

My dog will always be in secure areas off leash. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

**12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Snuggly please

**13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

I’m open

**14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

I’m fine with a Dog that is suspicious of door knocking and entering the yard. A protective streak is a good thing in my book. At the theatre it’s very important that my dog is safe to be around children. 

**15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

No.

**16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

As long as I know, I can manage it. 

**Lifestyle**

**17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Rarely.

**18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

Hypoallergenic if possible, for the kids sake, but not totally necessary.

**19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

I have large birds and very senior Australian Shepherd 

**20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Yes, ages 8+

**21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

I own my home 

**22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

Southern CA: not sure of bans.

**23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

It’s summer year round ;) Summer 90F, Winter 70F

**Additional Information and Questions**

**24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

Thank you!"
690,[Discussion] Why is my dog bathroom shy?,dogs,t3_aah86h,0,False,False,aah86h,"It's an odd question and in all the dogs I've owned I've never had one quite like this guy.

He will only poop if I, personally, walk him. He refuses to poop if my boyfriend (we got this dog together and he's just as much a part of my dogs life as I am) or the dog walker take him. I sometimes work 11 hour shifts with and an hour commute on each end and he will hold it all 13 hours until I get home! 
Sometimes I'll take him on a walk after a long work day and he will poop 3 separate times because he's been holding it.

Has anyone had this issue and have any luck resolving it? I don't like that he does this already but I'm going on a trip and I don't want him to hold it until he gets sick."

692,[HELP] My dog has a rash on his groin area that looks like roast beef? Wtf is it?,dogs,t3_aah3s3,5,False,False,aah3s3,"Our dog is a Lab and Doberman mix, more lab than anything. He’s never had a rash before. We recently took him to the vet for a lump he had. We thought it was cancer, but it was just a fatty bump on his leg. He also had a little rash in his groin area. The vet said it was a ring worm and gave us an antibiotic to kill it. He finished that and after the red circle disappeared, he has kept licking at it for a few days.

We grabbed a medicated spray for itchy or hot spots. That didn’t help. A bath hasn’t helped. He’s been licking at it for days now and we’ve never had rash problems before. We did move to a new house with a backyard that he can roam in about 7 or 8 months ago, but this whole situation started maybe 2 weeks ago.

Nothing has changed other than the backyard (again, over 6 or 7 months before the rash). We’ve already spent around $500 at the vet and I’d prefer not to go back, but he’s obviously miserable and I don’t want to be cruel.

The rash started out as reddish and has since begun to look almost like... forgive me... roast beef? It doesn’t smell, and it’s not dry. It’s kind of sticky looking/feeling. He’s constantly trying to lick it. It’s right where his balls used to be. Does anyone know what it is or what it sounds like? And for the love of dogs, how to fix it without going to the vet?!"

If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* Brushing is the least of my concern, I would definitely do it.  \*\*If I could let a professional do it, sure, but that costs money and I would be better off doing it on my own\*\*

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* For safety purposes I won't say my city, but I live in southern Sweden. Hybrids such as Czehcoslovak wolfdogs are legal since the 4th generation is free from wild animal trace or whatever it's called, but you need to take a few lessons in wild animal behavior and breeding.   

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* It's very cold on the winters (-5 celcious and such), and on the summer it is either very hot or very cold.  \*\*Dogs like Huskies will adapt well to the cold climate and can be shaved when needed \*\*

697,[HELP] Looking for alternative to dog park.,dogs,t3_aabfik,32,False,False,aabfik,"This happened yesterday, however I just puked stressing about it this morning.

I got home before sundown yesterday. Not something that typically happens, so I decided to reward myself and treat my dog, “Daisy”, to an afternoon at the dog park. Daisy sits next to me in my truck and becomes visibly more excited as we near the park. It’s easily her favorite place in the world. As I park, Daisy starts to “push” me towards the door. As we walk towards the dog run, she wants to pull me faster, but she does her best not to, all the way to the gate. I bring her into the buffer pen, take off her leash, and open the gate.

Immediately she started having fun.
Daisy went and said “hi” to every dog and half the people in the pen. Three black labs and a beagle start to chase her as she runs around the pen. The owner of the beagle begins to shout at his dog, because anytime it catches up to Daisy, it starts eating her ass. Daisy doesn’t seem to notice the beagle or any of the other dogs chasing her. She only has eyes for the brown lab on the other side of the fence. She barks, wags her tail and try’s to get the brown lab to run up and down the fence with her, (Daisy’s favorite game). After a few minutes, the beagle owner is tired of watching his dog give mine a rim job and puts his leash on and drags him towards the gate to leave. A married couple decided to leave as well and put their two black labs on leashes and start walking to the gate. Daisy then takes notice of the labs and approaches them to investigate.

Daisy got too close for comfort to one of the labs. It snapped and bit repeatably, lunged against the leash and tried pinning Daisy to he ground by her neck. The woman panicked, pulling on the leash and fell onto her back. Daisy stayed low and backed up, retreating without taking her eyes off the lab. Momentary chaos as everyone grabs their dogs, breaking up the fur pile the commotion attracted.

The woman quickly gets back on her feet, fire-engine red in the face, wild-eyed and unloads a flurry of curses at Daisy and I. She screams that she is going to kill my dog, that she is going to wring her by the neck, that all pit-bulls are no good and should be exterminated. The husband chimes in and says that my dog is no good, to get it out of the park and shoot it.
I’m a little in shock, the only thing I can think to say is, “Are you seriously talking to me?” The husband confirms that, yes, he is talking to me. I immediately retort, “Your dog attacked mine!” The woman exclaimed that she was afraid for her poor baby and she thought she was going to get her face ripped off. I looked at her dog, then back to Daisy, “Is your dog bleeding? Because mine is!” Daisy had small puncture wounds on the top of her head, right side of her face, and the nape of her neck. The woman protested that her dog was wounded too. But after looking her dog over, could not find a scratch on him. I explained that her dog felt threatened when Daisy approached and because her dog was leashed and couldn’t run away, defended itself and her. Another dog owner came to our defense and even berated the woman for leashing her dogs in the pen.

At this point the woman began to calm down and apologized profusely while shaking my hand. She explained that her dog is her “child”, that she was scared for her “baby” and that she was so scared that she wet herself, and that’s why she overreacted. I try not to react as I realize why her handshake was so moist. I didn’t want to upset her after making so much progress de-escalating the situation. I told her I understood why she was scared and why she reacted the way she did as she shook my hand again. The woman then apologized to the parents in the park for her outburst in front of their small children. She assured me that “we’re all good” as she and her husband left the park.

I’m still holding on to Daisy’s collar as I consider leaving the park myself. I ask all the other patrons if they are ok with Daisy and I staying. They assured me that Daisy was fine to stay and that woman and her husband were out of line. I let Daisy go and watch carefully as she plays with three other dogs, sniffs at a five year old boy then licks a girl of about ten as she gets petted. I start coming down off the adrenaline as I wash my hands and everyone else relaxes and goes back to watches their dogs play. About an hour goes by before a police officer shows up. The officer approaches the fence and I walk up to meet her. The officer asked if everyone was ok. I told her everyone was ok. She asked a couple of questions and I did my best to explain what happened. One of the other dog handlers comes up to us and confirmed my story, adding, “That bitch was drunk and acting crazy before his dog showed up.” The officer’s response was something to the effect of “I figured there was another side to this.” After asking again if everyone was ok, the officer left. Thirty minutes later, the sun dipped into the horizon and I took Daisy home.

I’m seriously considering swearing off dog parks all together. This is the third time Daisy has been attacked by another dog then blamed because she is half pit. The second time the cops have been called, (the first time was because she got loose in the neighborhood for 10 minutes). And the third time someone has threatened killing my dog for being a vicious attack animal that needs to be made extinct.! /s
Oh, and this is the only incident that involved all three scenarios!

This will be a non issue soon. I’m going to buy some land next year, put a trailer on it, and build my dream home away from the city.
Should I just keep my dog away from the parks till then? What are some other options?


TL;DR I took my dog to the park. My dog gets bit, then threatened with  genocide, and I get pee on me. Cops get called."
698,[UPDATE] My dog has had diarrhea for over 2 weeks.....,dogs,t3_aa63mf,16,False,False,aa63mf,"You can check my history for the previous post. I'm unsure how to link it on mobile.

My 9 1/2 year old bulldog was being treated for IBD after having diarrhea for over 2 weeks, but yesterday she seemed to get really uncomfortable as the day went on. I was going to wait and take her to her regular vet this morning but I couldn't stand to see her in pain and her belly seemed like it was swelling, so we took her to the E-vet.
They did a full panel of blood work, tested her thyroid, and did abdominal xrays to see if they could find anything. He did tell us that the xray showed one of her hips had no cartilage left, so she was likely in quite a but of pain from that (completely unrelated). Her white blood cell count was up so he knew she had some kind of infection which the metrinadozole (prescribed by her regular vet) wasn't helping with. We waited over an hour for a radiologist to look at her xrays because he wanted to be sure before coming to us with any news. It was abnormal, however he couldn't tell us exactly what was wrong. He said it could be cushings, cancer, allergies, or a number of things. He said she needed strong IV antibiotics asap and to be treated quickly because her abdomen was filling with fluid.
IF she made it through that, there would likely be much more extensive testing costing us in the thousands of dollars. We couldn't put her through all of that.
Without an official diagnosis, we faced the incredibly difficult decision to end her suffering. I could tell she was in pain. We went next door to the gas station and bought her a hot dog. She ate it happily with a wagging ""nub"" despite her pain. I held her until her last breath. She was my heart dog. She'd been with my husband and I for 95% of our relationship and 1/3 of my entire life. I don't know how my life will ever be normal again. It was so quiet last night without her snoring or shuffling her blankets around or crawling under the bed so we couldn't nudge her when she snored too loud.....
I am absolutely devastated but am trying to take comfort in the fact that she isn't in any more pain. I loved her so much and will never forget the unconditional love she gave to us.
RIP Tonka. You were the best dog in the entire world."

* &amp;#x200B;

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?   

&gt;This will be my first time personally owning a dog. Every other dog I have owned has been a family dog (a Marmaduke Great Dane, a Rottweiler, a black lab, and a husky mix) all of which (save for the Rottweiler) lived in an apartment with my mother. They were primarily trained by my parents, although I have trained a dog I was babysitting to sit and heal using reward based training with treats.

* 2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?   

&gt;No preference anymore. Initially my preference was to rescue however the application process kept weeding me out because I am young and my backyard isn't fenced in (or so I'm told) so I'm planning to go with a breeder.

* 3) Describe your ideal dog.   

&gt;My ideal dog would be one that can be left home for 4-8 hours of the day. If I need to come home at lunch that's fine, but the 8 hours would be more ideal. On the other hand, the dog has to be smart enough that it can be trained to be off leash for things like hiking, and camping, and playing in the backyard; so high energy as opposed to low energy would also be necessary because I'm looking for an adventure companion for things like: hiking, fishing, camping, skiing (cross country), snowshoeing, kayaking, snowmobiling, four wheeling, etc. Something that is okay with the cold (because I really enjoy winter activities) and the outdoors in general...

* 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?   

&gt;I've been looking at husky, lab, retrievers, Shepherds, and the like... I would really love a mutt though. I was looking at these breeds because they're smart and have a lot of energy, but also because I like the general aesthetic of them and their size.

* 5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?   

&gt;I would like my dog to be able to walk off leash with me, and ring a bell when it goes outside. Being able to run and wrestle and play with him/her without aggression is ideal as well... and of course, coming when their name is called. Honestly, if I could teach him/her to push a button to come in and out of the outdoors, I wouldn't feel so bad about leaving it at home while I'm at work.

* 6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?   

&gt;Ideally I would spend about 20 minutes outside with him in the morning before I leave for work, and then a few hours after dinner. On the weekends of course I can devote more time, and considering I would like to take him hiking and such, the more time the merrier at that point, but I'd need to be able to spend less time with them on the weekdays

* 7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?   

&gt;Let's say about 2 to 3 hours. This could be anything from running around and playing in the backyard with them, throwing sticks, or going on hikes and other such activities

* 8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?   

&gt;For brushing, every other day would be ideal to give myself a break in between, but I'm willing to do maintenance like nail trimming and cleaning, however fur trimming I would take them to a groomer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Preferences**

* 9)	What size dog are you looking for?   

&gt;Medium to large. I was looking at a Pyrenees for a little while but perhaps 3 x 40lb bags of food a month is a bit much (that's my only concern with a larger dog)

* 10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?   

&gt;I can handle lots of shedding and barking... not so much slobber. Slobber is okay outside in the heat, but not so much in the air conditioned house. Our great dane was constantly slobbering and would shake his head and get slobber all over the walls and ceiling, I'm not sure I could go through that again...

* 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?   

&gt;Very important (of the utmost)

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

* 12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?   

&gt;No preference although they won't be allowed to sleep with me in bed, or cuddle with me on the couch so probably less snugly...

* 13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?   

&gt;Honestly I want both. One that's willing to spend time with me and happy to do so, but that can also be left alone at home... I know that's a tough one... if I had to choose, then I suppose one that's willing to do it's own thing so that it isn't miserable at home while I'm at work...

* 14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

&gt;I would like them to bark to let me know there's someone there, and to maybe scare off potential intruders, but otherwise I think it's fairly necessary that they are cautious with strangers but friendly...

* 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?   

&gt;Honestly, aggression is the one thing I can't handle.

* 16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?   

&gt;I of course would like to avoid separation anxiety but I can manage it. The only thing I can't deal with is aggressive and possessive behaviors (that is, if I try to take something from it's mouth, I don't want it snarling and biting at me)

**Lifestyle**

* 17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?   

&gt;Weekly anywhere between 4 to 8 hours, weekends barely ever.

* 18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

&gt;My spouse has basically the same preferences as me, and we will have equal involvement in caring for the dog. Sometimes I might take the dog out in the morning, sometimes he might, etc.

* 19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?   

&gt;I don't have any pets and I don't plan on getting any other pets other than perhaps another dog to keep each other company when I'm away.

* 20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?   

&gt;No

* 21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?   

&gt;I rent currently, probably for about another year or so but there are no restrictions in the lease and my landlord has given me the go-ahead for whatever type of dog I wish, as long as I can clean up after it.

* 22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?   

&gt;Canada, Ontario, I believe there is a current ban on pit-bulls and similar breeds.

* 23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?   

&gt;Summer: 25 Celsius, Winter: -20 up to -40 Celsius

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Information and Questions**

* 24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.   

&gt;In order of preference and more simplistically my requirements would probably go as such: not aggressive, intelligent (to be trained off leash), size (medium to large), high energy for adventures but self sufficient when left alone while I'm at work. It might be good to note that I live on the outskirts of town, a non-busy street, and I have 3 acres in my backyard that leads into some forest.

* 25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

701,Headstrong vs. Eager to Please [Discussion],dogs,t3_aad4np,28,False,False,aad4np,"So just sort of an open discussion pertaining to something I'm a bit curious about.

It seems that most people prefer eager to please dogs, which is understandable for novice dog owners who aren't prepared to deal with a headstrong dog, but any thoughts on this trend in general? I find that I prefer headstrong dogs that are, ie. Huskies, Akitas, etc. I personally find it much more rewarding to have a dog that can think for itself and make decisions accordingly (worded poorly, every animal thinks for itself naturally. Re. I find it rewarding to find out what creative or specific motivator these dogs have in order to encourage them to learn commands), opposed to dogs who strive only to please their owner. I find that often times headstrong dogs become fairly reliable in responding to commands as their trust and loyalty is earned and reciprocated, which is all the better. Any different views on this or just stories of your pups in general in regards to this?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I worded this veryyy poorly, apologies for that! This isn't insulting eager to please dogs(or biddable, as someone kindly suggested instead. Which does make more sense) as they make up the better majority of working and sporting dogs. I fear for the day someone tries to turn my husky into a service dog lol. They're vital to numerous fields and activities and just as respectable. My statement was more or less as a matter of personal preference, as someone who does not need a working or sporting dog, but more or less a companion. The intelligent bit was also misguided at best, as others have pointed out, how biddable a dog is wouldn't determine how intelligent they are. I posted this with the intention of learning more on the subject and I'm attempting to somewhat update this post as I learn. :) Don't know the rules on linking articles in this, but u/shiplesp linked a great article on the subject!

One of our dogs got very sick from eating Nutrisca food. I haven’t seen much discussion about this recall other than [this general warning posted to this sub](https://reddit.app.link/6gkvNtbC1S), so I’m wondering how many other dogs were affected. 

As for our dog, he recently received a clean bill of health! He’s still not back to his normal self but we hope that will come with time. The dog food company has agreed to paying for all vet bills, including future bills related to the vitamin D toxicity. They are even reimbursing us for the last several bags of dog food we purchased. Overall we’re happy with how they’ve handled this situation. Thankful that the company seems to be full of genuine folks who truly want the best for their customers and pets.

703,[discussion] subscription box for dogs,dogs,t3_aagb44,3,False,False,aagb44,"Good evening dog lovers!

I am creating a subscription box for dogs and am looking for some advice or opinions from the very people who buy them! 

Based on the current available boxes for dogs. What could be improved upon? What would be something really useful, fun or interesting you'd like to see in the box? 

Is there anything you feel is missing from the current market? 

Is there something you do not like about the current boxes (be specific) why and how could this be improved? 

What if there were better options (more personability for the dog) 

Would you like to see clothing articles in the box? Collars, scarves, costumes? 

Could the box itself be improved in some way? 

Would you like to see different products variation in the box (rather than 1 toy, 2 treat bags and 2 chews?)

Deals with other dogs businesses for being subscribed? 

I can go on forever with questions but that's why I'm writing here! Please give me your honest opinions on the current market, what it's lacking, what it's doing well and how if it could be improved upon! Anything and everything you can give me will be greatly appreciated and maybe you'll see those changes happen in the upcoming box I'm creating. 


Thanks

704,[Help] Best first time dog that looks like a wolf?,dogs,t3_aag6n8,12,False,False,aag6n8,"So I'm soon turning 18 in a year and I have always wanted a dog that looks like a wolf, preferably a Siberian Husky or Alaskan Malamute, or maybe an East/West Siberian Laika, as my mother's cousin owned an East Siberian (sadly she, as in the dog passed away a couple of years ago). She was an unpredictable dog, I have to admit, but she was loving and didn't try to attack me. This may seem like a bold statement since I only met her twice, but from what I remember she knew the rules. So anyways, what dog should I get when I turn 18 and can afford one on my own? Suberian Husky? Siberian Laika? Or Alaskan Malamute? Any other recommendations?

705,"[help] sister got a dog over christmas from her MIL, sister thinks the dog is a pitbull which is illegal where they live. need help determining the breed",dogs,t3_aa8aht,56,False,False,aa8aht,"as title says ^ my sister got a surprise present from her mother in law over christmas, a brand new puppy. which wouldnt be that bad if my sister had any idea of the background of the dog, but her MIL only has extremely limited information. she told my sister that she found the puppy off of craigslist and messaged the number listed, and they talked and he said that the breed was a “mini aussie mixed border collie” and then sent pictures of both parents and the puppy itself, with no further information except that the puppy was around 7 weeks old (an obvious lie.) when he had come over to give her the dog he insisted he had to leave almost immediately after coming and getting the money, only saying that the dog could eat solid food before leaving (but not actually providing anything himself)

so here’s the real kicker: after my sister found out about this she was obviously upset at her MIL for not only buying a dog but without talking to her about it first; so she tried to contact the same number to get more information, but the number was completely cut almost like he disappeared off the face of the earth. she figured it was because of the age as the dog was obviously not 6 weeks and was a lot younger, but as the dog is getting older now she’s starting to get very suspicious that the breed is also a reason he’s no longer communicating. 

[here](https://imgur.com/gallery/zOqo526) are some pics. in order: the picture of the puppy sent by him, the pictures of the parents, and the puppy now. my sister said she’s slightly worried now that it might actually be a pitbull puppy, since pitbulls are illegal in denver. we’re not sure why anyone would sell a different breed than listed but we can only chalk it up to christmas madness. but please any help determining the breed at all is greatly appreciated we could really use any help we can get (or a redirect if this isnt the right place to post about this. thanks!)

TL;DR sisters MIL bought her a dog over christmas from shady craigslist ad, sister is furious and tries to get more info, number is now cut and sister is suspicious of the dog actually being a pitbull (illegal in denver) instead of the listed breed "
706,"[Discussion] [Update] I rescued three dogs, but a fourth was kept in inhumane conditions.",dogs,t3_aaahvl,14,False,False,aaahvl,"You may remember my post, or maybe not. About two months ago I rescued three dogs, Olive (mom, mini poodle) Boris &amp; Doris (son/daughter poodle x chihuahua). My coworkers mother was keeping these three tiny dogs outside in a shed. They'd been there for their whole lives (2-5 years) and had no medical treatment ever. 

I took them on the condition that they were her only dogs, ie ill fix your problem for you but I'm taking them all (her mom wanted to keep one, I know they're her dogs but you don't get to treat animals like that and then keep them, in my opinion). 

These dogs are the best dogs I've ever had, excluding my heart dog. I've rescued a lot of dogs, but Ive never met such sweet, smart dogs. They're so great. I just found out that she kept one back, their brother who was ""cute"". 

He lived outside, and since I took the others they put him inside. He stays in a crate 23 hours a day. I'm livid. Luckily, my coworker told me because her mother was wanting to get rid of him. I told her to bring him to me. 

I can't believe this. It kills me. I know it's weird, but I view him as *my* dog. I have his mother and littermates. They sleep in my bed, and when they go in a crate its only for a few hours. They have toys, great food, and lots of love. And he's suffering. I have spent hundreds of dollars on their care, and I agreed to do it because I was rescuing *all* of them. 

I can't stand the thought of him suffering. I hope they bring him soon. It was pretty tough to get the other three brought to me, I don't know why obviously they don't like dogs much.

709,[Help] Info on the relationship between puppy tolerance of restraint and resource guarding thresholds,dogs,t3_aabu8y,5,False,False,aabu8y,"I found an article about Resource Guarding (RG), located here as a PDF: https://www.gths.ca/wp-content/uploads/Article-Resource-Guarding-Dec-2-2014.pdf. 

The article discusses early signs of a low RG threshold. In particular interest to me is the following, emphasis added:

&gt;These signs are often overlooked because for the most part these behaviours are normal; puppies need to learn tolerance to body handling, restraint, etc. **However, in the case of a puppy with a low resource guarding threshold these behaviours are more pronounced and approach the excessive end of the scale.**

This article is the only one that I can find that correlates puppy unwillingness to be restrained with a low RG threshold. I want to find more information about this relationship. 

I emailed the author but she is very busy and told me to look into Jean Donaldson's book ""Mine!"" and Steven R. Lindsay’s text series volume 2, which I guess is ""Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Vol. 2: Etiology and Assessment of Behavior Problems"".  

I've read ""Mine!"" and don't remember the relationship being discussed. I downloaded the Lindsay book and ""resource guarding"" doesn't appear in the text at all, but he does say this at the beginning of the aggression chapter: 

&gt; Although most dogs are presented for treatment at 1 to 3 years of age, incipient signs of a developing problem are frequently observed in young puppies, often prior to 4 months of age.

Skimming the rest of the aggression chapter, I don't see anything else similar to what I'm looking for, but lots of great information on ""low threshold"" as it relates to aggression in general. I can draw the implicit connections between what I'm reading and what I'm looking for, but am seeking more explicit info.

Anyone know of any material that explores the relationship between puppy restraint tolerance and low RG thresholds further? "

713,[Help] Younger Dog attacked Older Dog,dogs,t3_aac7x7,0,False,False,aac7x7,"I wanted to get input on a sitatuation that happened a while ago with my 2 years old (at the time) Bernese/Lab cross. We got her as a pup and she ended up with parvo the next day. We spent weeks and tons of time and money and she survived it. Due to complications she ended up getting vaccinated later on and training took longer as well as socializing. From a pup she lived with our 10 year old lab (most pleasant dog). They never had a problem with eachother other than the occassional snarls from the lab to get puppy to back off. Fast forward a year, my bfs golden and my bernese are best friends, tons of play dates, etc. Now she is particular about certain dogs, so we always have her on leash for her safety and other dogs, don't take her to off leash, etc but she still gets walked 2-3 times a day and what not.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, when my mom and I were home alone eating sushi, our then 12 year old lab was begging for food. My mom turned to her and said 'nope, out, stop begging!'. All of the sudden the then 2 year old Bernese out of nowhere attacked the older dog. Grabbed the scruff of her neck and shook and growled. We were able to seperate them and get 2 year old outside but were a bit shook. After everything had calmed down, we let her back in and she was acting weird. Older dog would be in a room and she would sit at edge of room staring at her etc. I went to see older dog to see how she was doing and again, pup attacked her. I ended up getting bit in the process. Now, we seperated them after that as we have a basement appartment so pup was down there and older still had run of the house and always basket muzzled pup when they were together. Even with the muzzle, pup would sometimes lunge and growl at her for no reason. We got both checked at vet, pup was fine, older one had some health issues and passed a month later.

I continuously play this whole thing in my head wondering what had happened. I live with my fiance now and the Bernese (4 years old now) and a golden (3 years) who are best friends.

716,"[discussion] Breeder Refund - no receipt, no sales tax, recently moved locations, no contract copy",dogs,t3_aaf0cx,4,False,False,aaf0cx,"So I misjudged and blinded myself and ended up purchasing an adult dog from a back yard breeder. She didn't show me the contract until we met. The contract said the health guarantee was voided if NuVet was not given regularly, but I managed to avoid that by saying I'd prefer to consult a vet before promising to buy vitamins, and she wrote that in. Here's the big thing, **she didn't give me a copy of the contract after signing**. I thought there was a copy in the folder she gave me of his papers, but it's not there. **I** **paid through Venmo**, and **she** **didn't give me a receipt for the dog** (I got a receipt for the deposit a month earlier, also paid through Venmo). **She didn't mention anything about sales tax in the price.** She has recently moved from **California to Texas**. She lives north of Dallas, but **traveled to Corsicana** to trade the dog, where she likely has no license/etc to sell there. 

She told me this dog has no barking habits, no aggressive habits, no health issues. Vet says his teeth are in horrible shape even though he's less than two years, and he had 4 total shots and no boosters for rabies/parvo. We're setting up blood tests and urinalysis and I'll be dropping off some stool for testing today. We've only had him a few days, and I'm aware that there is a period for him to grow used to his new surroundings, but I don't think I can handle his behavior to everyone else. He is growling and barking aggressively at everyone in the family but me, and won't even eat treats they toss his way. He's doing a weird gasping/coughing thing when he's upset, and I am setting another vet visit for that. When he pees, he does it while walking on a handstand and it gets pee all over his fur on his belly and legs. He is intact, and I have set up an appointment to neuter him. I can't get him to learn sit or his name. He has pretty bad separation anxiety. Some family members are not happy with the shedding, so there's a lot of tension now about this dog. It's becoming evident we're not suited for each other. The breeder will take the dog back, but **refuses to give a refund**. She says it's in the contract (**she never mentioned in the verbal overview of the contract anything about no refund**, but she did say the contract stipulates to bring the dog back instead of to a shelter/etc). It was rainy and windy so we were in a hurry to sign and get out of there. We're not interested in having the money paid set as credit for a puppy. We're not interested in any more dogs from this breeder. With the details above, we think it's likely that she is not recording her income from this purchase in her taxes, and has no sales tax number. 

**Do we have a case to pressure her for a refund and return of the dog?** It's not like we've had him for months - it's been a few days. If not, I will keep him intact and try to sell him to a breeder to recoup some of the losses and give him dog companionship. I knew I shouldn't have purchased this dog from her - there were a few red flags - but I was blinded by his cute face and the time frame I had to work from home over the holidays and get to know him.

I’m sitting in bed, tears rolling down my eyes as it’s been every night since our fateful follow-up with the vet 2 weeks ago. ‘We’ve tried every option; were at the end of the road. The most humane thing to do for him is euthanasia’.    

I knew it before going in. We’ve been on borrowed time ever since you collapsed 2 years ago. They put you on meds, a few weeks of crate rest. We bought you an orthopedic gel bed. The first year you made a ‘almost miraculous recovery’ the disbelieving vet said. We were so thankful. A few months ago you started going downhill. Not moving as much, not the happy confident dog you once were. Back to the vet. They tried medicine for nerve pain which seemed to help somewhat, along with the cocktail of anti-inflammatoires and pain meds. You took your medicine dutifully as long as it was hidden in a tiny piece of salami (food is life for you). Things seemed ok, we thought it was just part of getting old. We celebrated your tenth birthday. Your muzzle was getting gray. 

A few weeks go we realized the meds weren’t really helping anymore. The anti-inflammatoires gave you bloody diarrhea so we had to stop them. You would be up and down all night trying to find a position comfortable enough to sleep. More pain medicine. You had a hard time getting in and out of bed. In the evenings you would sit next to me and cry from the pain. You stopped playing with your toys. You stopped asking to go potty and peed in the house - this would have been unimaginable before, you were so great at being potty-trained. The gabapentin combined with less movement made you gain weight. We put you on a pretty strict diet and you were just. so. miserable.  Your eyes were sad and dull.    

After considering all the details for the euthanasia options we decided to have it done at the vet’s instead of at home, and donate the difference to our local shelter in your memory. The company I work for matched our donation. The shelter was so thankful.  We then decided to donate every year on your anniversary.    

It took me 5 days to call the pet hospital back and schedule the procedure. I cried after I hung up, and every day since. You were my best and most loyal friend since the day I brought you home. I felt so damned guilty and helpless.    

For your last week we brought home all the dog treats you love most. All the progress you made on your diet went to hell as you happily munched away. We brought you to the park so you could sniff around your old stomping grounds as much as you wanted. You did pretty good with the walking, I have to say. It’s like you knew these were your last walks and you were determined to enjoy them.    

Last night you cuddled with me, licking my arm and hand, laying your head on me and looking up pretty intently with your one brown eye and one blue eye. You hadn’t done that in ages. I figured out at that moment that you were saying goodbye and thank you. I kissed your head all over and breathed in your doggy smell, told you I loved you and you were the best boy.    

Tonight we made clay paw prints as keepsakes. You didn’t really enjoy it. I put away your fancy bed, since you’re sleeping in the teenage boy’s bed tonight. It’ll be a while before I’ll be able to look at it. The teenager decided that your last meal tomorrow would be chicken McNuggets since you’ve never tasted them and he thinks you’d enjoy a few.    

Tomorrow morning I’ll bring you out walking one last time to enjoy the sun and fresh air. Then we’ll have your last meal all together for lunch, and the appointment is at 2pm. Your whole family will be there with you as you depart. I already asked my dad to watch over you in heaven.    

This time tomorrow night, you won’t be here anymore. I’m dreading the emptiness and worried sick about how the teenager who grew up with you will be taking it. My sole comfort is knowing that you will finally be pain-free; I’d much rather suffer in my grief than watch you suffer from all the physical pain.

720,[Help] Need advice- potty training a yorkie.,dogs,t3_aacorn,3,False,False,aacorn,"We have a male yorkie who is just over a year old and are having a few more accidents than we should. The dog is create trained and has no issues holding it for hours in the crate. But when out of the crate, we will let him out every 1-2 hours, and he will come back inside after peeing/pooping outside and pee/poop inside. 

We have done positive reinforcement, treats, wait outside until he uses the restroom, take up food between eating, and keep on a schedule of 1-2 hour let outs.

An issue seems to be, we can’t always get him to let us know when he needs to go out. When we are in the bedroom, where his crate is, he will whine to have us let him out(when he is outside of the crate), but when we are in the living room/basement he will not whine. So if he is out in these spaces, we are always watching but he still manages to sneak away and use the restroom- between the let outs or right after he gets back in. We have cleaned the carpets to try and get rid of any scent, use proper cleaning products for all accidents, but can’t seem to get him to stop. 

We can go days with no accident, but are not able to keep it consistent. I’m not sure what else to do, to get him to tell us in the other living spaces and to keep him from going inside. I am not sure if it’s just his little bladder- he is only 10 pounds- but he holds it in his crate, or if it’s because he is doing it out of anger/spite. 

Just looking for some tips to try! Any help is greatly appreciated!! "

722,[Help] Advice on what I can do to entertain my two under-stimulated dogs.,dogs,t3_aaeqgk,5,False,False,aaeqgk,"Currently me and my two sweet boys aren't in the most ideal of living situations. Luckily this is only temporary, but I'd still like advice for the meantime. I have two dogs one is an Alaskan Husky (aka sled dog) who is, as you can imagine, very high energy. My other pup is an American Staffordshire terrier, who loves being outside, and chewing just about anything. 

Right now we're living in an apartment thanks to the house rental prices here in Washington. I take them on walks during the day, but they are short walks because I am currently five months pregnant, and they're big dogs with totally different opinions on which directions they should go. 

This is the first time in their lives I haven't been able to provide them with a yard. I can tell they're bored as they are sleeping all day. I have a toy box for them with chew toys, but they are bored of those as well. I can't bring them to a dog park because my Staffordshire is so high energy around other dogs (not aggressive just hyper) that I've had issues with other dogs reacting badly. He's much better meeting new dogs one on one. 

If I had the funds to hire someone to take them on walks for me I absolutely would, but paying someone daily to take them on a long walk is out of our budget for at least two more months. My fiance works until late in the day and I work from home so their quality of life is my duty right now. 

So to my point! Sorry for the long intro. I am planning on using my Christmas money to buy them some stimulating toys but they are two very different dogs with different likes. My Staffordshire loves to chew and tear apart squeaky toys, my Alaskan Husky hates squeaky toys and only likes chew toys for playing the keep away game. What are some recommendations you guys have for stimulating toys and activities we can do in the house?"
723,[help] My dog has randomly changed his behaviour,dogs,t3_aabamc,13,False,False,aabamc,"So I have had my dog for around 2 and a half years and he has always been a really good dog. He was an abandoned puppy when we got him. He is an American Staffordshire mixed with something else. We live in Belgium.

He has always been kind to humans and other dogs, everyone in our neighborhood always comments on how nice of a dog he is and how kind he is. He has never barked at another dog while on the lease or been aggressive towards them during the 2 years and a half we had him.

Apparently 3 days ago my dad was letting him out in our garden (no fence) and he saw this one specific dog and just went nuts after him and started attacking him. My dad was luckily able to stop our dog before one of them got hurt and we got of with a scare.

Luckily the owner of the other dog understood our situation and we were lucky that nothing grave happened.

Today while playing ball with my dog he saw the other dog again and even after me pinning him down he went after the other dog, he ignored me shouting ect.

I was able to get him off the other dog before he did anything to the poor dog. He hurt himself while doing this and I'm really scared that my dog has become aggressive towards other dogs and is now an actual threat towards dogs or even potentially humans.

I wanted to ask you guys what I should do now, should I contact a dog specialist to retrain his behaviour towards other dogs, should we put a fence in the garden so he can't run out on the street again?

I really don't know what to do with my dog as I have a feeling that I can't trust him anymore when there are other people or dogs in the area.

Thank you for reading 
Any advice is welcome

725,"[Help] My dog has Giardia, are these symptoms normal? Please help!",dogs,t3_aae9fp,2,False,False,aae9fp,"Hello. My 12 year-old Lhasa Apso has been diagnosed with Giardia. He's my family dog, so he lives with my mom and I'm not living with them anymore. My mom took him to the vet because he was throwing up and not eating his food. The vet thought it was a problem with his teeth and advised her to soften his food by putting it in broth. They did a blood test on him to check his vitals and said everything looked good. However he continued to throw up and I was getting worried, so I took him to the vet. They did x rays and a fecal exam. The x rays showed he was slightly constipated, but were generally normal. The next day they called my mom up and told her he has something called Giardia. They told us to give him this powdered medicine (I can't remember what it's called) once a day for three days and give him 10 mg of omeprazole twice a day. They also advised us to keep him on a bland diet of rice and boiled skinless, boneless chicken. We followed everything and he stopped throwing up, however he also stopped pooping. Since he hadn't thrown up in four days and we were done with the powdered medicine we tried giving him normal food again. He ended up pooping which is good, but my sister told me he has thrown up yellowish-whitish foam three times since last night. It's really hard because I'm across the country right now so I can't take care of him. I made another (third one) vet appointment for him today. On the phone, the vet said we might consider doing an ultrasound. It would cost $450 which is really a lot for me. Even though he's my family dog, nobody else in the family really cares enough to pay that sort of money for him so it all comes down to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever had a dog have Giardia? Did they experience similar symptoms? How long did they last? Did you end up having to do an ultrasound? Any help on this issue would be much appreciated as I'm extremely stressed out right now. Thank you."

730,[HELP] Best dog breeds for home protection?,dogs,t3_aabbxm,81,False,False,aabbxm,"I'm looking for a dog breed or possibly breeds if they get a along well enough that are amazing for home protection.

I'm fully capable of looking after such a dog, have enough space for it and grew up around protective herding dogs, the kind that don't like strangers or allow them to come near.

So don't worry about any of that, I wouldn't be asking on here were I not prepared or capable.

That being said I now live in a suburban area, a couple years ago a house I used to live in was broken into while I was home, it was a scary experience, luckily the guy was alone and not carrying any weapons, he ran off as soon as he knew I was home.

That being said the experience has left me with the want for guard dogs.

Ideally I would like the dogs to ward off the criminal rather than any altercation actually happen between them however I need a breed that when push comes to shove they won't back down.

I have a pregnant wife atm and have thier safety and mine in mind.

Also, before anybody says it, I'm not an idiot, I know dogs aren't unstoppable and I don't expect them to be able to stop any and all threats that they may encounter, however 3 well trained gaurd dogs would definitley make me feel a whole lot safer to said potential threats.

**EDIT** Still waiting for breed reccomendations, I appreciate the concern you guys have raised but would love some breed reccomendations.

**EDIT 2** YouTube is a hell of a resource and have found out a lot of information about many formidable breeds that I'll look into and will eventually contact breeders. 

Am still open to breed reccomendations any of you may have though.

With that paragraph attempting to serve as background, we went on vacation over Labor Day weekend.  Since then, he licks himself a lot more often.

He licks both his front side and his backside, but I've also noticed him getting the top of his paws and parts of his hind legs.  I've also seen him lick the sheets or my feet.

I don't think I should scold him for it since he did pee exactly where I intended for him to, but I am not sure if I should take him outside this morning anymore. Should I keep him indoor to give him a message that if he does his business indoor, he loses his privilege to go outside?"
735,"[HELP] Is my Vet deluded or is just giving us, the owners a placebo in the form of homeopathic Silica? And do you agree with this form of treatment for a suspected grass seed in foot?",dogs,t3_aaaev0,3,False,False,aaaev0,"We’ve been to the vets A LOT lately and we’ve moved so we are trying to find the right vet for us.

My 8yo male Jack Russell got a suspected grass seed in his foot last Weds (19th Dec) we took him to the vet they knocked him out cut into his foot and found nothing and put him on a course of antibiotics (Amoxyclav 5mg). 

We finished the course and still no seed but his foot wasn’t getting better. We had to put down our cat on Xmas Eve night due to a suspected snake bite which was missed the first time and he was sent home after a day, we took him to the vet after hours and had to do the same Xmas eve to be told it may or may not be a snake bite, he needs a transfusion which is 50/50 chance of killing him and if not it could be eating a rat that had been poisoned or cancer so we put our poor old mate to sleep and had a rough Christmas.


So due to that fact we thought we’d take Baxter to another vet for a second opinion as we found he hasn’t been right since going under general anaesthetic the first time and didn’t want to put him through that again.


The vet saw him and seemed really thorough and we were happy with him.
He prescribed another form of antibiotics (Cephalexin 200mg) and some anti-inflammatories (Previcox 57mg) and Silica 6x which he claimed if we were patient would bring the seed to the surface in anywhere from 7-10 days to 6 months.


Now I’m fairly sceptical guy and he didn’t specifically say it was homeopathic but I suspected it was and confirmed it when I researched it when I got home.


So my question is, is my new vet a kook who believes in Homeopathy or did he give us, the owners a placebo so it didn’t feel like he was doing nothing by telling us to sit and the body will expel it?


I don’t believe in homeopathy and believe science has thoroughly disproved its effectiveness.

I’ve given him the Cephalexin and Previcox as prescribed but not given him the Silica 6x which from I can tell is just a sugar pill.

736,[Help] dogsitting a elderly dog with dementia without knowing it.,dogs,t3_aaadpy,7,False,False,aaadpy,"hi! i’m petsitting a 16 yo boy, a very good cocker. 

He is with me for 4 days. The first 2 days went good, he struggled just during the night, sleeping 5 hours and then starting pacing around the house. 
During the day everything was fine and we went to long walks. 

Today (the 3rd day) he definitely got worse.
He sleep like 3 hours and then started pacing around the house hitting his head on every wall and forniture (with the lights on). He eat just a little bit of boiled chicken. 

He totally has all the symptoms of dog dementia: paces in circles, remains blocked under fortnitures, staring at walls, looks disoriented, can’t chew properly and can’t put his head in the water bowl, loosing his balance ecc.. (he looks drunk)

His parents literally didn’t tell me anything about this situation.  I sent them video of today’s behavior and they told me that sometimes it happens.  That he has highs and lows. 

I’m worried because i don’t know how to help him, he’s hitting his head a lot (today he looks blind) on my walls because obviously this is a new environment for him. 

I was told that he spend the day on his dog bed, and when i met him the first time he was in fact very calm. 

I’m a little bit anxious because caring for a doggie like this is something for experts and he shouldn’t leave his comfort zone in this situation. 
I told them that mine is a passion and that i know how to deal with dogs because i had doggies, but i am not not an expert. 

I knew his age, but i already cared for elderly dogs, so i was confident about this. 
However i honestly never seen dog dementia. He’s being psychologically distruttive for himself and my family and i do not have the skills for this. 

I’m fortunately keeping him hydrated, but i’m worried because he ate very few and he won’t stop having compulsive pacing behavior (he could even hurt himself). 

I’m super stressed, i can’t have second for me, even for the toilet and no sleep because he restless paces all night and day. 

I was not looking for something like this.  I wanted to look for a normal pet, have fun and care for him, i didn’t want a medical-behavioral job.  
I also needed 3/4 hours per day to work with my pc, and i obviously can’t. 

Any advice? how can i make him better?

Thanks!"

739,[Help] Having a tough time finding a new brand of dry food for my dog with DCM. Here are my thoughts and some brands I am considering. Please steer me in the right direction!,dogs,t3_aa5zvr,10,False,False,aa5zvr,"A few weeks ago I learned that my dog has an enlarged heart. Since then I have been trying to learn all I can about the potential connection between diet and DCM. I have been reading all the related peer-reviewed articles and studies, and compiled a list of ingredients to avoid and ingredients to watch out for. 


It's been very challenging finding a brand or formula that does not contain those ingredients. In addition there are so many factors outside of ingredients to take into account! Like how the companies process the ingredients (i.e. thermal processing could lead to reduced taurine available for absorption) which isn't readily available information. Even ingredient interaction could still play a role in DCM and ingredients that may be toxic but not yet identified.


**I will try to summarize the options I am considering but I would really appreciate some help!** Note that my dog is a shih-tzu in her senior years. She has been eating Orijen Senior kibbles for the last 6 years or more.

***

# 1) Purina Pro Plan
Highly recommended in this sub due to the company's lengthy history, feeding trials and large number of veterinarians on staff. 

However, I found this [article](https://truthaboutpetfood.com/pet-foods-customer-service/) regarding a customer finding flakes of aluminum in a Pro Plan chicken formula. Is this something I should be concerned about?

Here are the 3 formulas that seem to suit my dog the best:

**Pro Plan Sensitive Skin and Stomach Salmon and Rice Formula**

* This diet is listed on Tuft's list of low sodium dog foods which is great for dogs with heart disease!

* In an article from AVMA it seems like this formula contains ingredients that they define as part of a ""BEG diet: (Boutique, Exotic-ingredient, and Grain-free): salmon and barley. 

* Salmon isn't really talked about in the articles/studies I've read (unlike lamb formulas that have been linked to taurine deficiency). They just categorize it as ""exotic."" Salmon may not be an issue I think?

* Barley, on the other hand, has lead to lower concentrations of taurine in dogs according to a 2003 NCBI study. 

**Pro Plan Small Breed Formula**

* Contains barley (see above)

**Pro Plan Shredded Chicken and Rice Formula**

* Soybeans is listed in the FDA investigation as an example of legumes. This formula contains soybean meal. 

##Pro Plan TL;DR: I love the fact the company conducts feeding trials and has a big staff of vets, but worried about ingredient quality/sourcing (i.e. article about metal flakes in kibbles). ""Small Breed"" and ""Salmon &amp; Rice"" formulas seem great except for barley. Though I am not too concerned because barley is more of an ingredient to watch out for instead of outright avoiding like legumes, peas, potatoes, etc.

***

# 2) BALANCE IT

This option requires a little more effort but I like the idea of using healthy ingredients that I already have (chicken thighs, broccoli, oatmeal, etc.). It involves weighing out proportions, cooking, and adding a supplement to ensure my dog gets all her nutrients.

My main concern was how legit this company is and the quality/safety of their supplement. It appears as though the founder is a certified nutritionist from UC Davis. I also see this company mentioned by the WSAVA which is reassuring. 

Any thoughts about them? I don't see many mentions on /r/dogs but maybe it's due to how time-consuming it is to prep home-cooked dog food?

##TD;LR I completely control the ingredients but it can be a bit time-consuming. Main issues: prep time and supplement quality.

***

# 3) SMALLER DOG FOOD COMPANIES

This could potentially be referred to as the ""boutique companies"" which have been connected to DCM. It also means they don't have the history behind their products, and likely don't conduct feeding trials or have vets on staff. Another downside (though minor in comparison) is most of these products require shipping to Canada.

The main positive is that I have found some formulas that contain none of the problematic ingredients. For example ""Frenchie's Kitchen"" chicken formula. Other companies whose formulas I like include ""Primal"" and ""Dogs For The Earth."" I believe these three companies are public about the source of all their ingredients which is reassuring. Feel free to recommend me others.

However, I really don't want to fall for marketing again (which lured me to Orijen's grain-free in the first place). 

##TL;DR Quality ingredients, no ingredients connected to DCM, but companies likely do not conduct feeding trials or have vets on staff."

I want to pad train her for when I am at work. Currently she is crated but I think other than the potty issue she is a good enough girl to be out. 
Here is where I run into an issue; with a puppy I would just keep her on the pad until she pees and praise her since they pee so frequently. However Midge is two years old. She goes hours between going potty. I can’t keep her on the pad for more than a few minutes because she lays down and I’m afraid she’ll learn it’s just another place to nap rather than potty. She also does not know what “potty” means, so I can’t just tell her to go potty. Any suggestions??

My next question is how do I teach her to play? She has no interest in fetch or tugging and I would really like a way to get out her energy on rainy days. 

Also, Midge is really gassy and it smells BAD. and she poops a lot. Not as in frequency but volume. Could this be a food brand issue or a take her to the vet issue?

Sorry for all the questions, I’ve always had dogs but I’ve always adopted a puppy so adopting an older dog kinda threw me for a loop!

My fellow dog loving redditors, I'm sure you've all been in that situation where someone gives your dog a treat without asking you first.

If you're that person feeding other dogs... Stop. Stop right now. You wouldn't feed someone's child right?

Speaking from experience, my dog has a serious pancreas issue and can only eat special treats prescribed by the vet. And while I appreciate your good intentions, you're not the one who's stuck paying the vet bill when you inadvertently ""poison"" my best friend.

All I ask is that you take 5 seconds to ask the owner if it's OK first."
745,[Fluff] Went to the vet for the first time today with an eye infection,dogs,t3_aa0ngt,10,False,False,aa0ngt,"Yesterday we woke up to Thors right eye slightly swollen and a small bit of puss oozing out from the corner of his eye.

We kept an eye on it and decided to take him to the vet today to make sure it wasn't anything serious.

This was the first time we've taken him to the vet, so we were slightly worried how he would react. He has been before but since we're his third owners, we hadn't had the pleasure yet.

He was SUCH a good boy at the vet! The vet praised him for being so inquisitive and curious and loving of new people. Usually the breed can be quite shy and reserved with new people.

He squirmed a little when the vet had to put fluorescent dye in his eyes to check his corneas but nothing too serious.

It was about time he got his yearly vaccines and check up so we decided to do this and save on having to get a new time next month.

He didn't even flinch when he got his shot and besides a bit of tartar (I think thats what it's called, we call it toothstones) a little too much weight and a small eye infection, he seems perfectly healthy.

He has been awarded with lots of pets and snuggles when we got home.

Just felt like sharing, and puppy tax for you ofc

746,[Discussion] What can I do with dogs as a job/career?,dogs,t3_aa7qvd,4,False,False,aa7qvd,"I have floated around in the pet industry for years, but it's time for me to grow up and get an adult job, and I have been applying to all these office jobs, but I'd rather continue with dogs. Only problem is, I don't want to be a vet or a dog trainer.

I did daycare and kennels for a while, and it was really fun, but it certainly didn't pay well. Then I learned about nutrition and pet products for a few years in a supervisor position at a pet store. I feel like I know SO much about dogs, and I've spent my free time reading books on dog behavior and doing internet research for years.

749,[Fluff] [Monthly Brag] My dog healed.,dogs,t3_aa4nn7,6,False,False,aa4nn7,"This year- my little trio was on a road trip to go apartment hunting half-way across the country. 

On our very last stretch of the trip while visiting family and staying the night- I woke up to a dog I did not recognize. In a city I has spent zero time in. Over night- a crazy infection attacked her face- that in a matter of hours spread all the way from her nose to completely around her muzzle. And after a day without a cone- to her eye. 

I ran around like a crazy woman- spending the last of my funds on emergency visits and veterinary offices- only to find out absolutely nothing. Skin conditions can be tricky like that. I learned a very important thing I can hopefully transfer to y’all- no matter how scary it is- do not waste your time on an emergency vet for SKIN CONDITIONS. Go straight to booking a biopsy somewhere. You’ll save precious time and money! And! STORE YOUR CONES SOMEWHERE. Don’t throw em out- cause sadly enough- you never know when you’ll need them. 

Luckily enough we were able to rent a room from friends long enough to get this figured out. Luckily enough- we ended up at the very first vet school that took low-income patients... Turns out my dog ran into a fungus she was not accustomed to along the way- and had a really bad reaction. 

For two months- she was coned. She was quarantined. For two months- she lost her ability to play and sniff and eat normal food. She was depressed and she was angry at the world for not being able to do the bare necessities. 

People told me to give up. We persevered- and she most definitely did not give up. They say that these skin conditions can leave a permanent scar, take up to a year to heal. That she might not have grown her hair back. Well y’all- this picture is from [today](https://imgur.com/m11Bqml).She’s back to chasing squirrels up trees. She’s growing all that hair back. She’s happy! 

And I am sitting here in my new place today thinking about all the people I’ve met that have said “well how’d you end up here?”
And I have the simplest answer of all, “my dog.”

750,[Help] Does my 12.5 yr old golden retriever have dementia?,dogs,t3_aa44nh,4,False,False,aa44nh,"Sorry for the essay - My boy Bobby is in superb physical health despite his age but he has been behaving oddly for the past 5-6 months. He has always been very well behaved, has never tried to escape, doesn’t come up the stairs (he’s not allowed) - but in the last 5-6 months he:
(1) constantly tries to escape so now we have to tie him to a long rope when he wants to go outside and this only happens in the late afternoon and evenings. He always barks (sort of whiney barks) when he is outside for no apparent reason other than only being able to go 5 meters from the door, and he refuses to come back inside even though he might’ve been out there for several hours in the freezing cold, even really tasty treats and food can’t lure him back. When he does manage to escape, we often find him looking confused in the neighbours driveway.
(2) he sneaks upstairs and scratches the carpet in the corners of bedrooms, mostly at door corners such as a wardrobe door or en-suite door - and again, he refuses to move even when offered treats. He always looks sad and worried when I find him and comforting him doesn’t make him any better
(3) he seems to get worried and scared when there are more than 3-4 people around, when usually he has always been very sociable.

He’s a golden and absolutely loves food, so it’s so strange that now even the tastiest and smelliest of treats cannot make him move and he refuses them. He still happily eats his breakfast and dinner every day without any issue. We have noticed he does better in the mornings - he is his sociable self, seems happy, looks forward to his daily walk, doesn’t try to escape. He also sleeps all throughout the night with no issues.
He doesn’t have any issues with urinating inside which is usually the case when dogs have dementia, right? 
Our main concern is when he tries to escape and he’s obviously not happy being tied up, I know he enjoys doing his rounds of the garden which is fairly large. We have thoroughly checked for escape routes but he always finds a way. 
He probably does have dementia... if you guys agree, is there anything we can do to make him happier?

Thanks for your help. Sorry for the long post.

752,[Help] Tips on how to help an autistic person overcome a fear of dogs?,dogs,t3_aa66le,8,False,False,aa66le,"My little brother is 20 years and and has high functioning autism. When he was very young, he had a couple traumatic experiences with dogs (he was never injured, the dogs were just large and very excited and he was very small at the time). Ever since these events, he’s been terrified of all animals.

We’re at my grandma’s for Christmas and she has the sweetest little 15 year old Havanese who wouldn’t hurt a fly. She is the first dog that my brother has felt comfortable being in the same room with, and he has verbally expressed the desire to pet her. However, he has come to a stand still. He’s been here for two weeks, and by the first two days he was fine being in the same room. A week and a half later, and he has yet to make further progress even though he said he wants to. We all are trying to encourage him, but he says that “anytime you tell me that it’s okay or that it’s safe, it just puts more of my attention on the dog and that makes me nervous”. 

This dog won’t even lick anybody let alone bite — zero danger. Although, I do empathize with my brother because I used to be afraid of dogs as well. But, I then met one dog who changed that for me and I fell in love. I’m of the belief that it just takes that one special dog that you connect with that can dispel many of your fears surrounding dogs. He has told me that he feels this is the dog that will do that for him, but we are having trouble getting him to push further in that pursuit and he gets very upset every time we try to make an effort. Any tips?

753,[help] Dogs similar in behaviour to Siberian Huskies,dogs,t3_aa6ygc,11,False,False,aa6ygc,"I recently lost both my dogs, one to cancer and the other to old age. My family considered getting a new one and I suggested a husky. After extensive research and meeting a husky which lives nearby, I fell in love with them. I watched so many videos that I am so accustomed to them. Unfortunately the weather here is too hot and even though we can make it work, we don't want to take in a husky and trouble him because of the heat. And I don't stay home too long due to college so my parents who generally take really good care of dogs, but won't let the husky into their bedrooms due to the extensive hair shedding.

755,[Help] Adopting a 4yo lab/husky mix into a house with a cat- looking for advice,dogs,t3_aa6fp9,7,False,False,aa6fp9,"Hello!

Like the title says, my fiancé and I are adopting a 4-year-old dog that is supposedly a lab/husky mix (she doesn’t seem to have much husky in her from her looks, I intend to do DNA testing). She’s being given up because her family recently had a baby with severe respiratory issues and the baby cannot be in a house with animals.

I grew up with a collie, golden retriever, and newfie mix. I was pretty involved in training them, and have helped friends with their dogs. Fiancé and I are animals lovers who have been waiting to own our own house to adopt a dog of our own- the timing seems perfect to give this girl a new,
forever home. We currently have a 8ish year old cat, who has been around dogs when friends with dogs have stayed over, and through one roommate who had a dog. She’s mostly aloof with any other animal, but tolerates their presence eventually.

The dog is fixed, up to date on all her shots, and seems well-socialized and pretty well trained. She’s never been kept in a crate. She has been around children, small dogs, and some guinea pigs, all without issue. Her current owner says she has chased squirrels and stray cats, but has never chased any indoor animals. However, she hasn’t ever been around an indoor cat and due to the distance between us and her, we can’t do an introduction prior to adopting her. 

So far, I’ve installed a very tall pet gate (with a small cat door) in an area where the dog can be confined while we are at work. I intend to introduce the animals slowly and to keep them separated unless we are around to monitor. Eventually, if they seem to be okay, I plan to leave the cat door on the gate open so that the cat can roam freely, but have an escape route if need be. 

I’ve read a lot about introducing cats and dogs, but most of that advice includes crate training which I’m hesitant to do to a dog that’s never been in a crate, especially while she’s going through so many other changes. None of my dogs growing up were ever in crates, and that may also play into my hesitation. 

Does anyone have additional advice for introducing the two animals/ensuring safety for our very loved cat? Will it be less effective without a crate? Will her (possibly) being part husky make this more dangerous?

I want to do what’s best for both animals and all advice is very wanted. "

While I went to give my buddy a ride I came back to my dog acting really strange. She was wobbly while standing, almost tip over, would flinch her paws up every time she'd step as if it hurt, stare off into space and flinched anytime I'd reach my hand towards her. 

Since I was gone I don't know if there was an episode during that time or if this is as bad as its going to get. I took her to the vet regardless, he's seen it a million times so he's not as worried as I am just to try pill 1 pill every 12hrs gave me 6 of them and then to go from there. 

But now she's just laying on the couch motionless I can't take it she's usually so high-strung and playful, she's a German wirehair. Usually some time after a seizure a dog regains it's personality, right? It's been well over an hour now and since I work nights shes usually up later than this. 

Should I be worried of something happening again? Did the whole process exhaust her or is she depressed about it? She finally fell asleep after 20mins of starting into space but I wonder if I should stay by her at all times for the rest of the night."

758,[Help] Aggressive Boxer!,dogs,t3_aa7p8s,4,False,False,aa7p8s,"Soooo, I have a four year old male Boxer that I adopted when he was 8 weeks old. I’ve raised him from a baby &amp; he is my baby! 

Basically his entire life he’s been pampered &amp; spoiled &amp; has remained true to the breed - adorably dumb &amp; forever in puppy mode. Boxers are my breed! They’re the best &amp; I’ve had them my entire life.

He is a playful &amp; snuggly dog around all kids, loves everyone (terrible guard dog) &amp; is super intimidated by our cats. Basically a big ol’ puppy. 

Then he sees another dog &amp; Cujo appears. 

His aggression towards other dogs is extremely violent, it almost seems like he *wants* to *fight*. There is no separating him when he gets into that mode, he basically loses his mind &amp; turns into a legitimate beast. It’s honestly terrifying. 

This behavior didn’t start until this year. He’s four years old &amp; we’ve had other dogs in &amp; out of our home all of his life (we’ve housed many dogs for friends throughout the years). But now a really horrifying trait has emerged &amp; he’s become difficult to handle.

We recently got new neighbors &amp; we’ve had to carefully coordinate with them regarding dog outdoor schedules because they have a Boston Terrier that our dog keeps trying to attack through the fence.

We can no longer walk him because every time he encounters another dog he loses his fucking mind &amp; immediately starts foaming at the mouth &amp; wants to attack from a mile away &amp; he’s 90 lbs of pure muscle so he’s difficult to handle on a leash/harness when he enters that frame of mind.

Just last month, there was a stray dog who wandered up to our fence line &amp; my Boxer just happened to be in our backyard &amp; a terrible fight ensued &amp; our dog pretty much attempted to rip off the face of the stray dog through our chain link fence. It was a blood bath. I called animal control. 

Every time someone is walking their dog, I have to make sure he’s inside &amp; if he’s already inside, I have to make sure our big door is shut so he’s not even able to look out of the storm door because he’ll charge the glass just to *try* to get to them.

I am at a loss. 

Over the summer I reached out to a trainer that was recommended to me by multiple people because he works with aggressive dogs &amp; yet he more or less kind of told me that he wasn’t going to help with my dog because some dogs just have that bred into them &amp; on one hand I believe that but on another I call bullshit. 

I love him, I’ve raised him. I don’t know what I did or didn’t do that has made this behavior come out but he’s pretty much become a major stress in our lives because he’s a ticking time bomb &amp; a liability &amp; he’s going to kill someone’s dog &amp; that’s going to be devastating for EVERYONE because then he’ll be the next to go. I’m at a loss. "

766,[Help] Advice on possibly rehoming a dog with behavioral issues (separation anxiety),dogs,t3_aa5o0t,5,False,False,aa5o0t,"It kills me to be making this post, but I really want some advice. I have a dog (Chihuahua mix) who has extreme separation anxiety. When I first adopted him 5 years ago, I didn’t work so all my time was for him and we were the best of friends. He was a sweet, chill, well behaved dog. Nowadays I have to work full time, and his behavioral problems due to anxiety just keep getting worse and worse. I have tried everything, from behavioral training, getting him a crate, supplements, spending more time with him, extra exercise, but none of it is even remotely helping. He gets into everything when I’m not paying attention to him and it makes him sick.

I think I’ve come to the realization that he’s not as happy as he could be with me. I think he needs someone who is around more, and unfortunately being in my mid 20s, that can’t be me. As heartbreaking as it is, I made a commitment to ensure that this sweet dog has the best life he possibly can, and I think the next right thing to do may be to see if there’s someone who might be a better match for him.

Has anyone had any experience with rehoming dogs with difficult behavior issues? He’s not aggressive. I’m not trying to pin this issue onto someone else unexpectedly, so I want to be upfront. I know that he needs a specific kind of person with a lot of time for him. I guess I just don’t even know where to start. I’ve never rehomed a pet before and the fact that I’m leaning toward this has made me cry so many times. Ultimately I want him to be happy, and I will not stop caring for him unless I absolutely know that I found someone who could make him happier than me.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* I would like something smaller since I live in an apartment. I've only ever had border collies, so I would be comfortable with something similar to that, but a border collie's energy level and need for stimulation will not fit my lifestyle at this time. I've also spent time around golden retrievers, but I worry that those would be too big for my current lifestyle.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* The most important thing is being good with people and other dogs and being a good walker. I would also like to teach the dog to do tricks, but that's not very important.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* Several hours a day. I am gone for work about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so I worry the dog would not get enough interaction, but besides that I will be able to interact with the dog almost all the time.  

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* I plan on walking the dog for at least an hour every day. I don't think there is a dog park in my area, but there are a lot of dogs around, so it will get plenty of interaction with other dogs and people.  

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I am open to brushing and basic grooming at home. If the dog needs an actual haircut beyond basic trimming, I will take it to a groomer, but I would prefer to keep this to a few times a year rather than a monthly trip to the groomer. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Something smaller that can live in an apartment. I believe most apartments in my area have a 50 lbs limit for dogs, so something smaller than that. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* I prefer a minimum on all three. A quieter dog would be ideal since I live in an apartment.  

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* I would like a dog that can learn to handle itself off-leash so I don't have to worry about what it may do, but I do not intend to let my dog off-leash in an unfenced area.  

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* I would like a snuggly dog.  

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* I would like an eager-to-please dog.  

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* I would like a dog that will alert me to someone entering our home, but doesn't go crazy with barking and jumping.  

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No. Because of the area I live in and living in an apartment, a dog-aggressive dog is not an option. There are other dogs in my building, so the dog will at some point encounter another dog in the elevator. It must be able to behave with other dogs and people in an elevator.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* Chewing on things  

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* About 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* I am the only person in the household, so the dog will be my responsibility.  

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* I may at some point get a cat.  

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* No, but there are children in my neighborhood, so I would like to teach the dog how to interact with children.  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I currently rent. I believe the weight restriction is 50 lbs and under.  

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* I live in Wisconsin. I am not sure about laws banning specific breeds in my area, but I am not interested in controversial breeds, such as pitbulls, because I rent and they would limit my housing options.  

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* The temperature in Wisconsin fluctuates a lot. A summer day is usually around 80F, but can get into the 90s. A winter day is around 20F, but can get well below zero.  

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* I travel a lot throughout the state, so the dog will also be traveling a lot. I need something that will be good with car rides. A typical long car ride will be 1-4 hours a few times a month. There will be plenty of opportunities to stop and let the dog out, so it won't be 4 hours straight in the car.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  \* Is there a dog that is even right for my lifestyle? I worry about leaving it home for 8 hours while I'm at work. "
773,"[HELP] We brought in a stray, and want my current dog to be comfortable",dogs,t3_aa6x7z,2,False,False,aa6x7z,"On Christmas Eve we brought in the sweetest and most gentle black lab stray- we figured she had to have been somebody’s pet at some point because she is spayed, but her current health conditions are so severe it was obvious she had been separated for awhile or was poorly taken care of. 

Not to go into too much detail, but long story short when we took her into the vet they found a microchip. Apparently her previous owner has died and has nowhere to go but the pound. She is estimated to be 8 y/o with severe hematoma in both ears (so solid the vet couldn’t drain them), ear infections, and is extremely underweight. We figured that her chances of being adopted as a middle aged dog with health conditions that require attention were not fantastic, so we decided to keep her. 

What I’m worried about is our current dog. Our current dog is a 5 y/o female lab mix. They did not meet face to face until today, after Stray got the OK from the vet. Current dog is friendly but cautious around new dogs, but does have a couple of doggy friends who we have noticed she gets along great with. I have been hearing horror stories about keeping two females together in the same house. I was wondering if anybody had tips to make the transition easier? During their first meeting, new dog was very lick-y which I understand means she is showing some submissive behaviors. They did ok- they aren’t playful but they don’t seem to hate each other. There have been a few snaps, but I’m assuming that’s just some normal doggy communication that doesn’t need much worry. Current dog let her in the house fine after some outdoor introductions, and they are existing in the same space pretty decently. 

I don’t want tensions to build / develop to a point that we have to get rid of new dog, but we have to keep current dog happy as she is our first priority. Is this f/f pairing inherently a disaster? And is a not-perfect first impression mean they will never be friends? Are there tips for a smooth transition for both my new and old dog? "

We’ve had her for about 1.5 months and we’re having a rough time in the potty department.

That alone would be enough to cause a major backslide if she ever was trained but we don’t know if she was.

This ends up being about 400 a month and then I end up spending \~150/mo averaged for vet bills, tick/heartworm, insurance, food, toys, etc.

Do people really only spend \~1000 a YEAR on their dog? Could be helpful for people perusing this thinking of getting a dog to get some more anecdotal info as well!"

778,[Help] My dog is not friendly to my husband,dogs,t3_aa2uys,6,False,False,aa2uys,"Hey all.

A bit of background: I've had my dog, a female shepherd/husky cross named Karma, for a little over three years now. She was about three when I got her and I was told she had been badly abused by a man in the past, so she would be a bit careful around men in general going forward. I'm female, so she bonded to me quite easily and we're the best of friends.

My husband recently moved in with me, as of September this year. When I'm around, she still clearly prefers my company, but will tolerate him or sometimes even indulge him in play. When I'm not around, or even if I'm just sleeping, she is very cold to him. She growls and shows her teeth when he approaches, hides upstairs from him, and won't even come down when asked if she wants to go for a walk (#1 favourite thing in the world) or offered food (#2 favourite thing in the world). He has even tried to put her collar and leash on while she's upstairs, so that she understands he really means he wants to take her for a walk, and she will just lay there and stare at him, refusing to budge. The only thing that ever works is pouring her dog food into her dish, which brings her running downstairs at top speed, at which point he can slip on her collar and leash and take her outside for a walk. On her walks with him, she is completely fine.

He has never hit her. He offers her food, treats, cuddles, pets, and play very often, but she never warms up to him unless I'm in the room. How can we get her to like him more? I know the abuse in the past is the key factor here, but it's been over three years since that's happened at least, and my dad also used to live in this house, so surely she understands by now that men are not all bad. She even approaches men she doesn't know who visit our home, or men we encounter on walks, albeit carefully.

Thanks for any suggestions!

779,[Discussion] / [Advice] Human gets between dog fight and comes out bitten - what would you do?,dogs,t3_aa6jzd,3,False,False,aa6jzd,"My first-time dog-walker (call him ""Steve"") took my dog (""Samson"" - 2 y/o large breed) to the enclosed dog park in my apartment complex. The only other people/dogs there was my neighbor (""Blake"") and his dog (""Bubba"" -3y/o large breed). I was not there. Neither animal has any history whatsoever with aggression or biting humans.

\-

Samson and Bubba have played before. They are both good dogs, but do growl when playing occasionally. This time, however, apparently their fighting got more serious than usual, Blake stepped in to separate them, and came out with a bite on his hand which he says came from Samson. He had to go to ER, see a hand specialist, but thankfully has no long-term damage and now no further treatment is needed.

\-

Blake and I have been extremely cordial and communicative throughout the whole process. I was out of state when this occurred, so I've had to listen to the only two accounts present - Steve and Blake. I'd like to keep Steve's account out of the equation here, as it makes things more complicated as he does not sound reliable (as in, when I asked him what happened he made no mention of any injury or bite whatsoever, when it was apparently so clear that Blake was in pain that 2 other neighbors came out of their apartments to see what was going on). That being said, for the sake of argument, let's say Blake's account is factual. Blake says (in his own words) that he should have pulled Bubba by the hind legs, but instead, grabbed him by the chest/torso - which happened to be where Samson's next bite was landing. I want to make clear, that this is his account and that I'm not trying to put a positive spin on this for my sake. We've both apologized, agreed this is an unfortunate circumstance, and Blake has said countless times he knows Samson was not going for his hand, that the force dogs use against each other is far different than what they use with humans, etc.

\-

Neither of us want to involve legal counsel and would like to handle privately. I've let him know that I'm happy to help with medical costs, but did not give specifics or an amount. He was grateful for that, the same way I was for him (at this point at least) saying he did not wish to hire a lawyer or take this to court. He is a genuinely good person and I'd like to think we are both rational, not-reactionary people. Our most recent meeting was important as it finally totaled the bills. After insurance, the conclusive cost was $900.

\-

I asked him what he believed was fair. He asked for me to pay the full amount. I said I'd like to think about it. I wanted to ask this community, from an ethical and/or legal perspective, what would you offer?

\-

PS - just in case some people ask, but not sure this factors into your answers, both of us are tight on money. I am in debt (but with a steady job) and he is a full-time grad student.

PSS - I have already let Blake know (in person) that I wasn't planning on paying the full amount (but I do want to pay some portion of it) - and asked if refusing to pay ""all"" of it was problematic for him. He said no, that it was just a starting offer. Why not ask for it all at first. I told him I'd do the same thing if I were in his position."

She’s very small in comparison to the rest of the breed which rest around 50-60 pounds generally and she should be 40-45 max

We take her on 2+ mile walks at least 5 days a week so she is getting an appropriate amount of exercise and keep her on a lower amount of food so we know that isnt exercise at least isn the issue here

She is on prednisone for it which I know causes problems with weight so we’ve been looking into getting her on a different steroid

784,[HELP] Dog suddenly behaving strange around 10 month old baby... unsure what to think.,dogs,t3_aa1m80,5,False,False,aa1m80,"Our 7 year old terrier mix has always been super sweet with our new addition - kept his distance most of the time but would come by with the occasional lick and tail wag, and would lay in her room as I put her down for a nap. Baby's now nearly 10 months and crawling and walking with a push toy like crazy, and suddenly I have a weird feeling about his behavior towards her. He follows her around when she's walking and gets up in her face to lick her and if I call him to sit on the couch and leave her alone he watches her like a hawk. I can't tell if it's just cute protectiveness or if I should be worried that her new mobility is causing him to, I dunno, feel more dominant? He's also been more clingy with me, following me around the house and sitting next to me all the time. Perhaps the two are related... some sort of newfound jealousy?

I suppose I should be 100% transparent and admit he's had aggression issues before with other dogs and strangers (mostly mailmen). We've been extra super cautious with the two of them because of his history, and as of just a couple days ago he's never displayed any sort of worrisome behaviors towards the baby ( I wonder if I'm being paranoid because of past issues?)

Are there any behaviors in particular I should keep an eye out for? I NEVER allow them to be alone together of course, but everything I search about ""issues with dogs licking baby's face"" seems to be about germs whereas I'm more concerned about him becoming aggressive towards her.

Any insight is appreciated."
785,[Help] Older rescue seems miserably bored but won't play,dogs,t3_aa0x3m,8,False,False,aa0x3m,"Hello all! Haven't posted on reddit in years so hoping this is all within this subs rules...

&amp;#x200B;

I have a +/- 10 year old rescue brussels griffon, who my husband rescued before we met and it was estimated he was around 5 at that time. We have speculated that he was very likely a stud, as his features are purebred, he was not fixed (at \~5yo) when he was found, he has a clearly abusive history/PTSD, and he didn't know how to use stairs, a harness, or act like a ""dog"" (barely still does).

&amp;#x200B;

He's come A LONG LONG way and we're so proud of him, but now that he's happier and healthier, he's much spunkier and seems to be needing something that we cannot figure out  / don't know how to give him.

&amp;#x200B;

An attempt at a long-story-short: he never learned how to play and won't play, but is bored to death all of the time it seems like. He doesn't care about toys (but also doesn't have enough teeth to use them anyway) and is not really smart enough (sorry little guy) to fetch or anything of the like. He's food-motivated but only for meals (kongs w/ peanut butter, etc, have failed and his face is too flat for food mazes, he'd just starve.... ), and leaving him with food-motivated toys only results in him pooping or peeing on them (he's only housebroken when you're home... joys of a rescue). We don't have a yard right now and are not allowed to get another dog in our place... we've been looking to move FOR his sake specifically, but it's been unrealistic so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly, the only way we've ever been able to figure out he likes to ""play"" is for him to stand vaguely out of reach from you and bark. That's it. He doesn't/won't stray from us at off-leash parks and he doesn't care at all about other dogs. He's not smart enough (or simply not interested enough) in doing anything like nose-training (and tbh I'm not sure his senses are good enough for anything like that either). Sadly we can't afford doggie daycare and don't have any friends with dogs to go on dates with, and no friends who can stop by to get some energy out who are available or nearby....

&amp;#x200B;

He's often sighing heavily and constantly fidgeting (not in pain, had that checked out....) and is very dramatic during the night standing up and collapsing down onto the hardwoods when people are trying so sleep, clearly indicating he is antsy. All I can think of is to just walk/run him harder but he's fickle about that (particularly in inclement weather, in seattle), and that's not very ""fun"" either really.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just wondering/hoping anyone might have any behavioral insight or suggestions who know more about this than we do? Poor guy seems miserable and giving scritches/pets/love is just not cutting it. Thank you so much!!

786,[Vent] People need to stop putting their hands on random strangers' dogs in public places without asking. ESPECIALLY when I'm actively training the dog.,dogs,t3_a9vthd,20,False,False,a9vthd,"Some people disagree with me, but I'm of the opinion that dogs don't really like being pet on the head.  I know that about 2/3 of the dogs I've had in my life (over a dozen) would much prefer a chest pat.

Then we amp that up by introducing the people who don't ask permission to pet a stranger's dog and just assume that because the dog looked their way and isn't growling that touching it is okay.  And then they always go for the head.

Then we amp that up because a lot of these people have children.  Some of these children get to the dogs before the parents do and immediately man-handle them whilst squealing and screaming.  This could be *extremely* dangerous and result in a dog being put down for being ""dangerous"" or ""aggressive"" when he was actually unexpectedly tackled from behind by two rambunctious children.

Then...  We amp *that* up by throwing my training into the mix.  I cannot tell you how many times a week my training sessions get fucked up by random folks or their kids coming up behind me then touching the dog as I'm working with it.  I really can't stand it when they *call the dog to jump up on them.*  I can catch them if they're coming from the sides or in front of me, but when I'm working the dogs and their owners and they come up from behind, I usually don't see them until there's a hand near the dog's face.

It pisses these folks off when I tell them not to touch the dog because it's in training.  I really want to ask them how they'd feel if someone just ran up behind their child and picked her/him up and gave it a kiss on the cheek?  And that's still not incorporating the risk of freaking out a skittish dog and causing it to snarl or bite.  People usually don't bite, even when they're freaked out...

I can't believe this isn't common courtesy knowledge.  Maybe it's because I grew up around dogs and have worked with them for seven years...  But it's still unbelievable to me."

Although he doesn't explicitly express it by whimpering or anything like that, I think that he is in deep pain due to his condition (I've read that bone cancer can be extremely painful) and am looking for more information on whether the lameness and tiredness he is expressing is tied to his feeling unwell or his pain.

Thank you in advance.

My roommates and I are going on a road trip to a buddy’s cabin this weekend for New Years. I had a bunch of family over this past weekend and he did really well, so we’ve decided to take him with us, instead of leaving him at home. 

Every time he gets in the car, his whole demeanor changes. He’s all of the sudden really calm, drooling a ton, sometimes throws up, sometimes his breathing gets shallow. All the signs of anxiety and needing the throw up. I already went to one vet and they weren’t any help. I’m going to be taking him to another vet at the start of the year for a wellness exam, and to address any issues we’re having, once we get to know normal a little better. 

The car ride is 3 1/2 hours. He doesn’t seem to want to chew during car rides, he just seems to accept that he’s going to throw up. We have tried on the floor in the backseat, on the backseat, and in the front seat. It doesn’t seem to make a difference. Time also doesn’t seem to matter. I took him on an hour car ride once, he was GREAT. Last week I took him 20 minutes away and he puked on the way home.

793,[Help] Neverending allergies and concurrent infections; our pup is suffering.,dogs,t3_aa1of8,20,False,False,aa1of8,"\[Help\]  My husband and I rescued my dog, an AmStaff, 1.5 years ago and he's currently 3.5 years old.  He had red paws and itchiness when we first got him, which was diagnosed as allergies by our first, local vet.  This began our neverending battle with allergic reactions and skin infections. (He turns tomato red, licks constantly, has broken skin w/ pustules at times, and often carries concurrent infections. Sometimes I wonder if the skin infection is truly a by-product of the allergic reactions or if he has an ongoing infection separately and in addition to his allergies.) The thing is, his issues have gotten exponentially worse with time.  Last winter he was fairly decent, but this winter he is miserable without some combination of ketoconazole (antifungal), apoquel, and cephalexin (antibiotic) and, sometimes, even when medicated he is still bright red and absolutely miserable.  The vets claim it's because he's allergic to non-seasonal triggers (mold, food) but that doesn't seem plausible to me, because then he would have reacted similarly last year, no? We've seen 4 vets and they all give the same advice (more drugs, more drugs, more drugs) but I've had my own experiences with constant antibiotic/medication use and know first-hand the repercussions.  I cringe every time I give him his medicine at this point and am emotionally exhausted from seeing him suffer and feeling powerless to help. We've had him allergy-tested and he's allergic to so much that I feel like he might have immune confusion, histamine intolerance and/or mast cell activation disorder; vets don't seem to want to entertain that possibility though. Here's a list of what we've tried and/or are currently trying:

* Specialized diet (removed offending foods; fed only freeze-dried and frozen raw)
* Allergy-testing (allergic to many proteins and peas, along with grasses, trees, weeds, and some molds)
* Low-dose immunotherapy shots and sublinguals (started with shots - total nightmare, so switched to sublinguals; over-reacted to the triggers so took him off it)
* Apoquel  (as needed; makes him lethargic and cuts allergic response in half)
* Antibiotics (specifically cephalexin, aka keflex; so many rounds I can't count)
* Ketoconazole (antifungal; daily - absolutely terrible for his liver)
* Medicated shampoos (once weekly; seems to temporarily kill bacteria and yeast but also irritates his already damaged skin)
* Non-histamine producing probiotics (daily)
* S. Boulardii probiotic when not taking Ketoconazole to see if that would reduce yeast issues (didn't notice a difference)
* Digestive enzymes (daily)
* Immune support supplement ([Thorne's Immugen](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/immugen-reg) for dogs)
* Kidney glandular supplements (for DAO supplementation to reduce histamine; no noticeable improvement)
* [Histoplex supplement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073G7N2G5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) by Biotics Research (no noticeable difference)
* Betadine spray and liquid betadine for his skin (seems to help but it stings and he hates it)
* Quercetin w/ Bromelain (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Benadryl and Quercetin (natural antihistamine; no noticeable difference)
* Pollock Oil (anti-inflammatory; improvement in coat and skin but not irritation/reaction)
* CBD oil for inflammation and discomfort (just started)
* Redonyl Ultra (just started; contains PEA and omegas; hoping it stabilizes mast cells and helps his skin)

I'm sure I'm missing something but this is where we're at.  Any help at all would be much appreciated.  We're so desperate at this point. :-(   Thanks, everyone.

My Doodle is acting very out of character; hiding, wont go near the puppy, scared. He loves other dogs and is usually so playful with them but he seems terrified of the new pup.
Is this normal behavior?"
795,[Breeds] What breeds would be right for me?,dogs,t3_aa1kjj,6,False,False,aa1kjj,"Hi r/dogs! I am currently a grad student and could not take care of a doggo right now. Being a (good) dog owner is definitely a goal in my life so I wanted to be a bit proactive now, and look into what companion would be best for me in 2-3 years..

**Introduction**

 * *Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?* 

Yes! I have no experience.

* *Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?*

 I would prefer going through a reputable breeder, especially since I might be interested in showing my dog.

* *Describe your ideal dog.* 

I would like my dog to be my companion. They would be fairly easily trained and more on the quiet side. I'd like them to be playful without being overly excited.

* *What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?* 

I live in a small apartment so toy breeds are definitely what I am looking into. Most of my family is in Europe and I like that I could bring my dog with me in the cabin when flying (I think the max. weight is 16lbs?). I was interested in long-coated Chihuahuas especially. I loved the look of toy Eskies but I hear they love to bark, which my neighbours would never forgive me for, same for Pomeranians. I also liked Italian Greyhounds. In any case I am open to suggestions!

* *What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?* 

Definitely basic obedience. Like I mentioned, if they can, I think it might be fun to go to dog shows - I really like the idea of my dog and I having our own special activity. Later on I might be interested in fostering seeing-eye dogs in training, so a dog that can get along with other dogs would be ideal.

**Care Commitments**

*  *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*  

I don't have an clear idea of what my dog would need in terms of training, but I thought I would be interacting with him pretty much constantly when at home.


*  *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?* 

I would like a total of 90 minutes/day split into maybe 2-3 walks, or smaller walks + going to the dog park. I also want my dog to either go to daycare during workdays, or at least be visited my a walker once a day.

*  *How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?* 

I am open to it completely, I hope my dog can be too! I would rather avoid going to a professional and save money that way.

**Personal Preferences**

  *  *What size dog are you looking for?* 

A mini one! Definitely toy or a small breed.

*  *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?* 

Medium shedding, although these are things can be dealt with. I am much less open to barking, so minimal barking.

* *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?* 

Not very. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

  *  *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?* 

Very much a snuggly one, otherwise I'd get a cat XD. I do worry about separation anxiety though..

  *  *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?* 

 Since I am a beginner, I think an eager-to-please dog would be easier for me, although there are limits - didn't someone post about their dog pooing to please them?? XD Yeah, I'd rather not, thanks dog.

  *  *How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?* 

By coming to me first I guess? With some curiosity but not bother visitors.

 * *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?* 

No. I don't know what I could do if my dog were aggressive in daycare for example..

  *  *Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?* 

Barking is the big one, I guess things like puppy biting and walking on a leash can be taught or addressed so I can't think of anything else.

**Lifestyle**

  * *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?* 

I am very much looking for remote positions but I will most probably work 9-5 so doggo would be left alone 4 hours before being walked, and 4 hours before I come home. I am looking into daycares.

  *  *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?* I will be the sole caretaker of the dog.

  *  *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?* 

I want to foster seeing-eye puppies in the future, or at least get other dogs.

 *  *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?* No.

  *  *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?* 

Yes, I rent. There are no specific restrictions but the dog should be well-behaved. I think having an obedience certificate might be an asset but that is just my opinion. In the future, if the gods smile upon me and I am able to ever afford a house, you bet I'd like big dogs.

  *  *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?* 

I am currently in Montreal, Canada, but I may move upon graduation. The city currently taxes pitbull owners.

  *  *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?* 

Summer: 25-28 Celsius or 77-82 Fahrenheit although climate change is hitting us hard and we had weeks at 35-42°C or 95-107°F. Winter: 0°C to - 20°C or 32°F to -4°F

**Additional Information and Questions**

  *  *Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.* I don't have a car, and don't plan on getting one. 

   * * Feel free to ask any questions below.*
I would like to know how much daycare is costing you guys, or if you have tips on finding reputable breeders and dog walkers.. I am curious to hear all your experiences and feedback! Thanks for reading all of this!

797,[Discussion] Big dog being slightly aggressive towards small dog,dogs,t3_aa4rr4,1,False,False,aa4rr4,"So, we just got a new dog last week. I believe the breed is Lhasa Apso. He was abandoned and we adopted him from the shelter. He's about one year old they said. He's a good little guy. He has a calm demeaner, and it seems like he had started training. He follows behind you when you're walking, knows to stay and sit, and he loves playing with his toys. He has no behavioral issues from what I can tell.

Our old dog died about 6 months ago and she was about 15 and never really played with our old dog much for the last year of her life.

Our other dog is an 8 year old husky heeler mix. He's super high energy, my mom has trained him to demand attention. She has coddled him the past six months since her other dog died. So he follows her everywhere, gets up in your face if you aren't petting him, expects to be fed at the dinner table. All fine, but I think it contributes to his issues with the new dog.

We made sure both dogs were okay with each other before we adopted him and the adoption lady said everything seemed fine and we took him home.

Well it's been a little over a week now and our old dog is really aggressive with the new dog. When the new dog has a toy, the old dog comes over rips it away from him and takes it back to his bed and leaves it there. If the small dog tries to grab it, the old dog growls or snaps at him. When they're both outside, if I throw a toy and the small dog reaches it first, the big dog kinda shoves him and rips it away. If the small dog is getting pet, the big dog stares at the small dog and starts growling. If the small dog tries to sleep in the room with the big dog(my parents room) the big dog growls or takes up more room so the small dog can't stay.

As a result, the poor guy sleeps on the couch all day and doesn't get to go to his bed. He won't go in the room where my parents sleep unless he's walking with someone else. He doesn't get to play with any toys and he always looks so sad. I try to give him the attention he is lacking, cause he is just a pup still, he deserves someone spending time with him. But I can't do that all day. My mom, who stays home all day, says they just need time and it's perfectly normal. But I can't help feel that if the old dog is not disciplined for his behavior, he'll normalize this and not change.

So I'm just curious on what we can do better? What can I do to make the small dog happy? Do they need time? Am I doing something wrong? Does the old dog need discipline? I just don't want this new dog feeling left out. We brought him home with the promise to love him and I don't think he feels at home. Sorry if this seems stupid, I just want to correct this early so it doesn't remain a problem."

Or even filed with a dremmel. We have tried sneaking up while he’s sleeping, pinning him down, bought our own dremmel, given him treats, etc. but it’s only gotten worse in the past few months. I have asked several groomers to try, and our vet. They have no luck even with restraints. My biggest fear is that he will get himself hurt at a vet or groomers trying to escape restraint. He does eat away at his back nails himself, so his back paws are not as bad. His front nails however are so concerning I could cry. It is not quite to the point that he’s walking on his nails yet, but they are incredibly long and need to be cut immediately. According to my mother, she was able to pin him down and cut a few nails at a time up until recently. I plan to try a couple different groomers in the area tomorrow, but thought I would also try here for advice. Has anyone else found themselves in a similar situation?

The problem started yesterday after noon, while i was at work i was petting this female pug and then went home, later that night my dog started sniffing me and got really excited, and then tried to hump my hand, which he never does, especially not to me bcz i'm his owner + I'm a male.

Every time when i lay down he starts crying (only when we are alone in the room) like asking for attention, when i do give him attention bcz i'm trying to make him quiet and let me sleep, he gets serious for a sec, and then tries to hump me.

So i was laying and he started to you know, move and stuff, so i was like, ok he will stop soon, but he didn't i put a pillow next to him so he won't get close to me and he starts humping it. The next thing i see is him with his ** out, i started panicking, i started pushing him so he would stop bcz 1.i didn't want him to hurt his ** and we'll have problems later on. 2. I don't want my dog to hump me, nobody fu**ing wants that. So after he finished, with the pillow came the punishment and then he was acting normal again for the rest of the night.

Today was a normal day, and he acted as nothing ever happened, acted normal and quiet. 
Until now, i just layed down, and he again starts crying, every time he does i sprinkle (i don't know the word sorry) regular water which i poured into a bottle for cleaning.

This has never happened in those 10 years, and i do know it's not bcz he wants attention, he just got 100% lust, from yesterday both i and the clothes were washed so ofc there is no scent of the female pug. He haven't been through castration, and it's too late for that as well.

I hope you could help me with this, i'm tired and i can't sleep next to him crying ((it's 1:30 here)he sleeps in the bed with me) it's annoying and I'm sensitive hearing people/ animals suffer, so every time he cries i get mad bcz i know he isn't suffering but just baiting me to comfort him, and i am afraid of harming him bcz usually if he gets hit by something he like screams a bit, but when i push him to go away from me he is too stubborn, he continues trying without stoping, and i don't want to hurt him.

However recently, whenever I bring him for a walk and someone passes by our house he would become extremely aggressive and start barking, lunging and showing his teeth. He's never been a very gentle dog but he's never acted out in situations like that before (before he would only bark and lash out it someone is continuously petting him when it's obvious he doesn't like it or sometimes when he sees other dogs).

804,[Help] My dogs dick is always out. What can I do?,dogs,t3_aa1pfd,2,False,False,aa1pfd,"Hey guys! So, I have a 4 year old Shih Tuz Yorkie named Beans, I love him and he’s great even though he has his moments. For some reason his dick is always out. Sometimes it’s just the tip other times it’s a good inch. Whenever people meet him I can tell it makes them uncomfortable. Even I think it’s gross and awkward when it’s just out, I’ll say “Beans, put your dick away you perv”, I get no response.  He’s a really cute dog so I get a lot of people who want to meet him and cuddle with him. I’ve taken him to the vet twice, payed 40$ for the vet to just flip his skin back over his dick.  Which was pointless because when we got home it was out again! I cut the hairs around his dick Incase they were getting in the way of him pulling it back in. That maybe him licking himself was to try and lubreacte it or something. I tell him to stop every time I see him licking himself and then don’t make eye contact. Sometimes, like if it’s really cold or for some unknown reason, he puts it away but only for a few hours. I don’t remember if he’s always been like this, he’s my first dog so maybe I just thought it was normal at first. I don’t know what else I can do since the vet hasn’t really been helpful.

805,"[Help] Dog's whimpers, anxiety, and noise driving me nuts - at my wits end!",dogs,t3_aa3sud,2,False,False,aa3sud,"Throwaway because this is really complainy and probably makes me sound like a not so nice person.  I have a 13 year old Chow Mix, she is about 60 lbs.  We've had her for about 2 years, and adopted her from the shelter.  While she came well trained in some very positive ways, I am having some serious problems with annoying behavior and I am not sure what to do.  Its so bad that Christmas Eve when she managed to break out of the back yard and went missing, I had mixed feelings about her returning.  If she had happily moved in with another family, I think I might have been okay with that.

The first day I got her and my husband left the house, and I was home alone with her, she ran up to me and HUMPED me.  I shook her off and she did it again.  I am a small female and felt ridiculously uncomfortable.  I know it is my fault on a mental level that it creeped me out so much, but I cannot help it.  I know she is a dog and not a creepy person, but subconsciously I found the incident disturbing.  I think this caused me having trouble bonding with her.  I didnt really want to pet her very much.  The other thing that hurt our bond is she was constantly chasing my cats and tormenting them.  This behavior is better, but I love my cats to death and I was very upset that they no longer wanted to come out and cuddle but hide from her.  Most of my cats are back to normal now, took about 6 months, but I have one that has become so reclusive we had to give her her own room.  Whenever I go into this cat's room, the dog will sit outside and whimper loudly, which scares my cat who needs my love and care.  Right now she is so scared she refuses to come out of the closet and I need total quiet to get her to come out so I can pet her and bring her to her water and food bowl.  Yes, this is my cats fault, the dog has not actually chased her in a long time, and the cat has also become afraid of the other cats too.  The cat needs help.  I am aware.  However, that doesn't change the fact that I want my dog to go away from outside the cat's room door when I am attending to the cat.

As I type this I am in my bedroom and she is in the dining room outside my bedroom and she is whimpering.  She whimpers constantly.  It is high pitched, whiny, loud, and obnoxious.  Sometimes the reasons why are obvious, like there's a thunderstorm, and that is fine.  I always let her come in my room then and it usually helps.  However, most of the times the reasons I believe are due to anxiety, but I often can't pinpoint what.  For example, today I was in the kitchen making a bowl of yogurt, and she just starts whining.  No reason at all.  Just. Whining.

She also hyperventilates about 90% of the time and this will often turn in to whimpers and whines when she gets too worked up.  She'll start by panting/ loudly breathing really fast and intensely.  She will do this for hours and hours.  I have been around dogs my whole life, and it is much quicker than normal.  I have even had visitors comment on it, so I know its not just me, but the vet says it is fine.  I also was around a bunch of dogs over Christmas, and it stunned me at how CALM they were in comparison to her, even with all the people around.  So anyway, when her breathing really speeds up, she will kind of turn the breaths into whimpers and then start whimpering for a while.  She can control it too.  When I tell her to hush and look at her, she stops until I look away and then starts again.  The only time she doesnt do this is when she is asleep, which isn't very often.

I have really bad anxiety, and trouble with tachycardia, and this causes my anxiety and tachycardia to go through the roof.  When shes breathing quickly and anxiously it causes my heart rate to skyrocket and I need to either get away from her or take some propanolol which my doctor prescribed to lower my heart rate.  I try to mentally turn it off and ignore it but I cannot.  It is so loud and all encompassing.  She also will often follow on my heels whatever part of the house I am at- her nose a few inches from my butt - on high alert and follow (while panting of course).  That is OBNOXIOUS.  If she is not doing that she is usually staring at me with her ears up, trying to get my attention while doing her hyper pants and will not let me relax.  I just want to be able to read my Kindle or tend to my indoor plants or do something in peace.  As a result of this behavior I have stopped spending time in my living room and just go in my bedroom where I can keep her away.  in the 10% of the time she is calm and relaxed, I always make a point to praise her, and tell her she is a good girl, but it doesnt seem to be helping much.  As a result, my relationship with my cats suffers more.  Also I enjoy(ed) using other parts of the house.

At night she will sometimes go sleep at her doggy pillow (preferred, and this is far away from our bedroom), but when she gets bored she will get up and whimper outside our door.  She also has these loud jarring yelps that she will do when she wants to go outside.  I absolutely do not allow her to go outside until we wake up.  She always gets a chance to go to the bathroom before we got o bed.  Unfortunately my husband will sometimes go and let her out at 5AM.  I am not okay with this and have asked him not to, because it shows her that these yelps will get her what she wants.  She has the tendency to do this right when I am falling in to REM.  They are not like normal person walking by the house barks- which don't annoy me.  These are insidious in that they have the ability to rouse me from a deep sleep and completely recondition my brain so that I cannot go back to sleep for about 90 minutes.  They are extremely loud too.  It is like flipping a switch in my brain, and she knows it.  It is effective, it gets us up and gets my husband to let her outside.  As a result, I have been sleeping with these over the ear head phones, like the ones that you would use at a gun range...  they help in that I dont hear her nearly as often.  Ear plugs are not enough.  The headphones drown out almost all whimpers and about 75% of the yelps.  However this is not sustainable.  For one, they hurt my ear and neck, and are ripping at my hair.  More importantly, I am due in 2 months to have a baby and I will need to be able to hear him when he wakes.  I know I will be very sleep deprived soon because of the baby, and I don't need the dog contributing to this!  I also do not want these yelps and whimpers waking the baby.  In addition, like the cats room, whenever I go into the nursery I am preparing she starts loudly whining and whimpering.   This is absolutely unacceptable.  I can't have her doing this whenever I bring him to his changing table to change his diaper, or go to put in him or check on him in his crib, or any other reason I am in there.  

She will also do these bark/ yelps I mentioned for outside when she wants back inside, in the day or whenever.  I would prefer that she wait quietly by the door - we can see her.  I only let her inside when she has not barked for a few minutes, and this does seem to be helping somewhat.  Again my husband often will let her back inside when she yelps, which only enforces the behavior.

She has a clean bill of health for her age - only some minor pain in her back that the vet doesnt think should be bothering her too much.  All of the rest of her is in working order and the vet is not concerned about the excessive hyper panting, even though I can't imagine it is healthy and have never seen it before in another dog.  She is intelligent and picks up new tricks quickly, and was also well trained before we adopted her - she rarely goes to the bathroom in the house (and if she does its usually because we forgot to walk her or we were out all day, so its not her fault) doesn't sit on or paw on furniture, chew up the house, etc.  If it weren't for the excessive noise and hyper activity, she would be a great dog, but I just cannot relax around her and I am at my wits end.  If I cannot fix these behaviors and they cause more problems with the baby I don't know what I am going to do.  It would kill my husband if I were to rehome her - she's his first dog and even though the problems bother him he is attached to her.  I've never even thought about wanting to rehome a pet before, and I have never had a dog or cat I couldn't bond with, besides her.  Its also not like the dog doesn't know that these behaviors are problems - like I said she is smart.  Any advice on how to train her to calm down and be quiet?"

807,[Help] Senior Dog Increasingly Aggressive,dogs,t3_aa3nki,4,False,False,aa3nki," 

So our 13 year old 32 lb corgi-Sheppard mix has been with me since 2007. Since I adopted him, he's been a great dog with energy and playfulness...etc...until recently. Almost 2 years ago my wife and I had a daughter, who has now taken attention off the dog. As a result, our dog has been unruly and jealous when it comes to our daughter. He has always been food aggressive and protective of his bow, but now that food aggressiveness has extended into aggressively stealing food from our daughter, and attempting to jump up and get food off of her highchair. He seems to think there's always food being given out and he has to steal it. I can have nothing in my hand and I'll pass by him and he will jump out and nibble at my had as if I had some food for him. He has a full bowl of his own food and water available to him at all times, but I'm not sure if he's just forgetting where it is? It's empty in the morning so he does find it and eat it. He does display some symptoms of dementia as he will randomly whine and seem to get ""lost"" in the house. I've recently ordered him some multivitamins and some CBD oil via Amazon and am hoping that helps calm him down. He seems in pain in his hips as he doesn't like to be picked up or moved anymore. In fact, if you pick him up he will snarl and bark viciously at you, and depending on who you are he will bite at you to let you know he doesn't want to be picked up. The other odd behaviors when it comes to our daughter is he will go to her door at night and sniff at the bottom of it, and try to get it open so he can get in. He used to get her door open at our old house where our handles were horizontal and not round. I'm not sure how to discourage this behavior (or if I should just open the door?). In the past he just would lay by the crib, but this behavior wakes my daughter up during her nap during the day. As far as how he normally interacts with her, he's fine, and my daughter is learning to gently pet him. Sometimes he gets in her space though and when she goes to ""push"" him away, he does that snarling/barking aggressiveness toward her without biting (at which point I have to tell my daughter to be gentle with him, but at the same time, she doesn't want him stealing her food o\_O). During the day he sleeps upstairs in his doggy bed in the master bedroom, but at night, he likes to not be in the same room as us, and sleep on the couch in the living room. When it's just my wife and my daughter at home, he sleeps upstairs like everything is fine. But if my wife, daughter, and I, are all home and downstairs, he will come downstairs and act jealous through excessively barking for attention (and even after we give him attention he still barks for attention). We tried various bark collar solutions and the only thing that we've found to keep our sanity is a muzzle, but that only lasts so long as he will eventually start to whine and cry to get it off. So we will take it off of him and he will eventually start barking again. At this point, my wife and I are doing our best, but our old doggo is driving us up a wall and we're not sure what to do. Any advice or explanation of his behavior would really help."
808,[Help] Dog poop problems,dogs,t3_aa3gfo,10,False,False,aa3gfo,"Ok, I'll try and be as quick and succinct as possible. We have a 15 year old dachshund who took to pooping in her crate overnight. She'd poop in there and then bark until we came in to clean it up. She'd do it even if we let her out right before bed and she pooped then. We feed her once a day in the morning right after we let her out. 

To stop the barking and to hopefully stop her being trapped in her poop until we could clean it, we stopped keeping her in her kennel at night and started just leaving her locked in the bathroom with potty pads. That stopped the barking, but it didn't stop the pottying. Oddly enough, even though she had plenty of room and could get away from it, she would poop and then smash the poop down flat on the floor (it looked like she finger painted in there every morning and every bit of poop would be smashed flat). 

So she'd have to have a bath and I'd have to get down and scrub the floor every morning. Even if we tried to paper the floor with puppy pads. 

The last couple of nights we've tried switching her to diapers. That's worked for the mess- she still pees and poops in the diapers but at least it's not all over the floor. Today, however, after I took the diaper off and put her outside I noticed she was straining to poop again. She passed some but kept straining even though no more was showing. 

Using a wipe I cleaned up her bum and tried to see if there was something stuck and she passed the last little bit of poop. There was a little bit of blood but she still kept straining. After another few minutes, she got more poop out and then seemed ok.  

However, according to my wife (she's at home, I'm at work) the dog is asking to go out every few minutes and straining while she's out there. She's also pooped a bit more in her bed twice (solid) and just keeps straining every half an hour or so and generally doesn't seem as if she's comfortable. 

She's never been an 'eater' (that is, she doesn't chew on stuff or eat random things off the ground). She IS passing stool and it's normal consistency, not diarrhea or especially hard. There's been just a touch of blood but no more than I'd expect from just a sore bum. 

Any other thoughts what it may be before I get her into the vet? "

810,[Help] Is it ever too late to train a dog not to bark?,dogs,t3_aa18zi,4,False,False,aa18zi,"Hello!

My 2,5 year old dog (terrier/pinscher mix) barks a lot, especially outside at other dogs and I am overchallenged with it. I am suffering from social anxiety and the looks people give you when your dog is barking is really too much for me and I don't like it when other people make a mean comment regarding my dog, since I truly love her and of course don't want anyone to insult her. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory: My mom and I got the dog together but she mostly had her and was basically the ""pack leader"". Our girl was always way more quiet when I had her and when she barked my mother only rant at her until she stopped. Over the years it got more and more out of control and we got a muzzle which I kept using when she barked and it was really a help. My mother wasn't using it though because ""she looked so awful"" with it. We often kept fighting about it but she never really used it. 

Well now my mom isn't there anymore (not dead) and I have the dog alone and she is seeing me as her leader now. While she isn't barking much at home, she basically always barks at other dogs outside. At home I can easily use the muzzle and I really see that it is helping, but outside it's different. When we see another dog I always try to change the street or something but sadly that's not always possible and honestly I rather want to solve the problem now and not just runaway from it. 

Now you're probably wondering why I don't use the muzzle outside - my dog isn't walking when she wears it. At home she is moving a little bit like getting on the bed and walking towards me but if we are outside she doesn't even walk if I pull the leash a bit. She is just standing there and I'd basically had to drag her behind me to get her going, but of course that's not the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be very thankful for any help and advice since it's taking a toll on my social anxiety and I'd really like my dog and me to have a good time outside."

812,[Help] Housemates beginning to not get along.,dogs,t3_a9zvzr,11,False,False,a9zvzr,"First post here, but I'm stumped as to how to advise my parents on their dogs. Sorry if I'm a little disjointed or if the formatting is off, there's a bit to unpack here. 

   A little bit of background: They have two dogs (and one cat). Both dogs are the same breed (American Bulldog) and sex (female), but differ in age. The older dog is around 7, the younger dog is nearing 2. Older Dog came from a shady breeder as the runt and we suspect she was abused before we got her, although it doesn't seem to affect her regarding aggression towards people or other dogs. She plays well with others and is very much a people pleaser. 

   Younger dog on the other hand, is a little...off. She came from much better beginnings than older dog, but has ended up with a mild form of congenital ataxia. Whereas older dog was a very easy to train dog, younger dog is slow to pick up commands and very hardheaded. Younger dog also is very easily scared, but will respond with aggression. (Example: Her and older dog on a play date with another dog, Younger dog took a potshot she almost regretted but Older Dog stepped in and defended her until people came to break them up.)

&amp;#x200B;

We've been noticing a disturbing trend between the two dogs though. Younger dog is starting to pick fights with the older dog. Older dog will do her best to try to prevent a fight, but Younger dog is so bullheaded that she keeps on until Older Dog can't take it anymore. Fights will erupt (all instigated by the younger dog) over affection, food, toys, and occasionally an unknown stimulus. Older dog will give younger dog a wide berth because she doesn't want to fight (doesn't like making my mom or dad upset) and will avoid as much as she can until she can't. 

Usually when a fight erupts it's after Younger Dog stares down Older Dog (with Older Dog avoiding looking at her). Younger Dog will take a potshot, and then it's on. Older Dog, despite being avoidant, will throw down when she has to. The fight I witnessed happened behind me after I gave older dog some attention. Younger dog stared down and took her shot, tried to take older dog down and got grounded by Older Dog. Older dog will not clamp down to draw blood, but will pin Younger dog down by the throat until she stops fighting. However, the second Older Dog releases, Younger dog is right back up snapping and snarling until Older Dog puts her down again. 

This is different from their play fights. I feel this is a challenge situation over resources (including affection). But we don't know what to do about it. I'm not so worried about having to break them up because for now fights are only occurring when people are home. My concern is what will happen if a fight breaks out and nobody is home. I don't think Younger Dog will stop. I think she'll keep on and keep on until both of them are tired or one of them wins. And I feel bad for the older dog as well. She shouldn't be slinking around the house hiding and trying to avoid a fight from the younger dog because she was there first. My Mom has thought about rehoming the Younger Dog, but is worried that with her ataxia (mild as it is, she's just forever going to be a little clumsy like a puppy with paws too big for their legs) rehoming will be hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to tell them. I did tell mom it wouldn't be as hard as she thinks to rehome for such a mild neurological issue, but I understand that she would rather find a way to solve the issue in the house. All issues aside, Younger dog can be incredibly sweet. None of us like how it's affecting Older dog though, because this was her home first. 

Is there anyone else that has had experience with this issue? What did you do to remedy it? Or is rehoming the only answer?

819,[Breeds] Am I a stupid idiot for wanting a German Sheperd as my first dog post-phobia?,dogs,t3_aa2isp,19,False,False,aa2isp,"Hey all,

So 2016 - 2018 was the two-year period where I kicked my phobia of dog's ass - note, I didn't kick the ass of any dogs during this period, that would be awful - and now I'm at the point where I can confidently be around dogs and it's like I'm not even around em. I've been looking into dogs, and I think a German Sheperd would be a good choice.

Here are some facts that might be helpful for you guys:

I'm 18, but I won't be going to college (called University here in the UK) for a good two years, maybe even three, and all I'm doing is my post-high school study called A levels. This means that I have a lot of time to devote to dog walking, training, all that.

I am financially stable as I saved a lot of money from when I wasn't in education and I receive a monthly sum anyways. This means that I am certainly not unable to provide for the dog.

I have a lot of space - I live in a three bedroom house with a garden, and one of the bedrooms is unused, as well as the dining room. 

I hear that German Sheperds are quite clingy and love to be around family, which I think would be a lot of fun as I can 100% provide the time commitments (practically) all year around. If I was to get a GS, I would choose my University accomondation accordingly; I want to make it clear to you guys that I am fully committed to raising the dog!

EDIT: I'd like to point out that I just realised that I have a very active lifestyle that might really benefit a GS - I follow a military routine (long story, not in the Army atm but I really enjoyed the training haha), this includes sprinting on some days, running every day; generally good cardio stuff that (I'm pretty sure) the dog would enjoy.

I don't live with babies or small children. I live with my dad who is a warehouse worker who is constantly active, and my brother who isn't around too much.

QUESTIONAIRRE:

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Zero dog experience, but I love the buggers now that I got over the phobia. First dog, but not the first dog in the family - my dad had a dog growing up.


2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?


* No preference.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.


* Loyal, physical enough that I can have fun with it when I go out on runs and the like, protective.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* GS, they look adorable and I would like a tough yet loving dog. They seem very loyal too.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Guard-type stuff, but I may be able to get in touch with my friend who is a K9 trainer in the Army (the lucky git)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Literally as much as I need. I'm out monday-friday from 9AM to 5PM, but the evening is the dogs, and so is the weekend. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* See my main post, I do a lot of cardio and strength exercises outdoors and this seems like perfect GS territory.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Totally open to that! We have HEPA air filters at my house that are rated for dogs so I don't even need to worry about annoying hairs, and no one has allergies either :)

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

*Medium - big. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*Infinite, haha. I think it goes with the territory of owning a GS.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*Not important, but if I had to do that I wouldn't mind!

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

*Is there such a thing as a mixture of both? I'd lead more toward snuggly though.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

*Eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

*Wouldn't mind them making noise when someone knocks on the door. We rarely get visitors but it would be nice if they were friendly with them up to a certain level.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*Yep!

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
Nothing that comes to mind as long as it isn't biting me a lot haha

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

*9 AM to 5PM when I'm at college, 9 AM to 3PM on Tuesdays. Family will be in but they have less dog experience.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

*Family are indifferent, but they'd feed the dog if needed.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*I mean, I might get a goldfish or something at some point, but no other four-legged friends!

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

*No. Very, very rarely - if ever.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

*No restrictions on dogs where I live, and I'll actually cater renting my Uni dwellings around the dog.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*UK, and the only restrictions are on the ""killer breeds"" that are bred to be violent; GS doesn't count.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*Summer days - Highs of 22 degrees celsius and lows of 11. Roughly 70 deg fahrenheit high and 51 degree low.

*Winter days - Really depends as the UK has a weird climate. Lows of -1 C (30 F) and highs of 7 or 8 (45 degrees) depending on the day. Lots and lots of rain though."

821,[Help] My senior dog is having a very bad post seizure recovery and is extremely hungry,dogs,t3_aa22bc,3,False,False,aa22bc,"My 13 year old pug started having seizures when she was around 9, they lasted about 30 seconds and she was perfectly normal right after. 

Two months ago she started having grand mal seizures that lasted about 3 minutes and were quite violent with a recover period of about 2-3 hours of disorientation. I started her on CBD oil and didn't have a seizure for a month. I switched to a pet specific one and I think the dosage was lower and I didn't realize I was only giving her 2.5mg instead of 5mg (20lb dog). She started having seizures again. Had 4 in one day and no amount of CBD seemed to help so I brought her to the emerg vet who gave me phenobarbital and gabapentin.

This was 24 hours ago and her seizures have stopped but her recovery phase is much much worse. She's been just screaming for the past 20 hours and her back legs barely work now. She's ravenously hungry, which I've read is fairly normal post seizure. But I think the screaming is from how hungry she is. I went to my regular vet to get something to sedate her because this dog usually sleeps 15 hours a day but has had maybe 4 hours of sleep. She was given valium and it helped her sleep for maybe 2 hours before she woke up and started screaming again. Food is the only thing that calms her down and she eats it like she's been starved. When I touch her, she sniffs my hand to see if I have food and will nibble a bit on anything around her mouth.

I'm worried it's all neurological and no amount of food with satiate her. I don't want to over feed her but I wonder how much can I give. After the first few seizures, she was running around constantly. 

I just want her to get some rest have to have the screaming stop. Has anyone had a similar experience?

TL;DR Dog had 4 bad seizures in one day. Is on phenobarbital and valium for it now and the seizures have stopped but she's screaming constantly and I think it's from hunger. Is it safe to over feed her or should I be doing something else to sooth her?"
822,[Help] The Worst Start to Owning a Puppy Ive Ever Had (on the verge of a breakdown).,dogs,t3_aa1qnt,12,False,False,aa1qnt,"I've always grown up owning dogs. I firmly believe man should grow with a dog to some extent. I recently became a licensed nurse, started making more, and finally got to a point where I could own a dog.

Seriously I had thought of all the necessary provisions, dog sitters, food, researched breeds, kept tabs on the market, etc. I had it all planned out. Even though I work night shift mostly, I could make it work. I refuse to believe that I can't do this just because I'm single living in a 2bed apartment. And when he gets older, I can always drop him off at my mom's omw to work bc she has a huge backyard and that would be good for him to stretch his legs during the hours I work.

My sister, who lives in Denver, finds a puppy she wants out in the state I live. She asks me to get it for her and she will venmo me the money. It's a Boston terrier pup. Cute Lil thing, but he adjusted extremely well. I was able to play with the pup, attempted to train here and there, and even had a dog sitter for it. Now, the breeder I'm buying from fails to mention he will be out the day I wanna buy the dog, so now I'm pressed to buy sooner. I buy him yesterday early morning thinking I'm gonna have all day and night with the pups and then I'd have a dog sitter for the next day. His name is Roy and he's a border collie.

11:00pm rolls around last night (12/26/18) and I get a call from my work, ""where are you? You're supposed to be here."" Apparently, my schedule was changed without my knowing. Now I'm in full blown panic mode. What the hell do I do now? I start calling ppl up left n right, hitting up dog sitters via Rover - nothing. I tell my date that I had earlier that day (I didn't leave the two pups alone for more than an hour btw) my situation, not realizing she would volunteer to help. So she says she will take care of them for the night at her place. Not ideal, but I can't deny that opportunity. So I do this. Now I have them back, trying to get some sleep before I have to work a freaking double from 3pm to 7am which was also scheduled without my knowing. Now I'm on the verge of a complete breakdown. I haven't been able to give Roy a good couple of days all bc of some bs with work and I'm thinking this will dramatically affect him. I can't get him to use puppy pads and I wasn't able to introduce the crate to him in a positive way at all. Idk what to do and I feel like I'm overwhelmed and drowning. Like I'm genuinely about to cry and freak out bc I didn't plan on it being so rough for Roy. For the record, the Boston terrier is named Austin and he's been doing really well, but Roy isn't. I put them both in the same kennel (it's a large kennel) to see if it would help Roy but it doesn't. He is constantly freaking out like how I am right now lol. Idk if I'm going to be able to keep up. How fucked up is this situation and am I being too dramatic here? Should I call the breeder and send the puppy back bc I am on total freak out mode and suddenly feel like I cant do this anymore. Like Roy had such a bad first day that I feel I  can't even repair whatever trauma he may or may not have undergone moving around so much."

He likes to run beside my when I go biking and running but when it comes to playing with balls or sticks or anything he just doesn't participate.

825,[help] what should we be looking for in a rescue/rescue dog?,dogs,t3_aa17l1,32,False,False,aa17l1,"TL;DR: are we asking too much for a rescue dog from a North West shelter? Dogs that fit this description are gone within the day and rescues keep sticking their nose up at us. Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog. 

Our wishlist for a dog: prefer small but only needs to be under 120 lbs (apartment restriction), cannot be a pit, gsd, or husky, must get along with other dogs and people, energetic and athletic, between 1 to 4 years old,

Sorry for the wall of text. This started as a question and has kind of turned into a vent with hope for advice.

So my husband and I are looking at getting another dog. We are having serious issues with finding a compatible dog and I am wondering if we are just asking too much or if we are just not looking in the right places.

Background: We are both from the south but are in the North West. We are definitely having a problem getting use to a completely different culture surrounding dog adoption. We are use to having tons of good dogs looking for adoption for anywhere from $25 to $100. Here the cheapest county shelter is $250, private groups start at $500, and the dogs are gone within a day or two.

We have decided to get an adult dog from a shelter for the ease and to skip the terrible puppy  stage. I have only ever had a dog I raised from puppyhood. My husband has never had a puppy and got his dogs as adults, but they also only had one dog at a time and the dogs were outdoor only dogs.

We have a 7 year old border collie mix who has lived with as many as 5 other dogs in a house and has never had any serious issues with any of them. She will never start fights, however, she won't run away when attacked either.

Problem: we have been looking at dogs since September and cannot seem to find a good match. We did adopt one dog in September but as soon as she became comfortable in the house it became apparent she was large dog/fear aggressive and would constantly attack our current dog (mostly over resources and proximity). This led to us returning her for fear that we end up having an ER visit or worse due to the fights (it got very close to needing an ER visit twice in the month we had her). It was a costly mistake as her adoption price was $575 and the rescue group black listed us because ""we didn't know how to handle dog with issues"". This rescue organization came highly recommend and they told us this dog ""didn't have an aggressive bone in her body"". They made no mention of issues before we adopted her but when I reached out to ask how to calm her down and get her more relaxed they told me ""she just needs time, she started fights when she first got here too"".

We decided to be more cautious, we have been more attuned to how our dog greets the other dog, how the rescue/shelter is organized, and really looking at the dog's personality. But so far we are always late and the dog is gone before we have made a decision on the dog.

We have also been avoided by a lot of rescues because we are young, in an apartment, and looking for a high energy dog. Our current dog is high energy and we really enjoy that energy level because we enjoy walking (walk a minimum of 2 30 minute walks a day), hiking, and are generally athletic people. I would also really like to get into dog sports. But the rescues always turn us to old, low energy dogs.I am really about to say let's save up and get a purebred puppy at this point even tho I hate the puppy phase.

Just in case you forgot (again sorry for the wall of text) the question is So are we asking too much? Should we be looking at other options? Is there certain shelter or rescue groups anyone can recommend in the North West? We are willing to travel up to 6 hours for a dog.

828,[Help] Which breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_aa144t,2,False,False,aa144t,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It would be the first dog we own. I have an uncle that owned and trained several Rottweilers and German-Shepards. So I was often around dogs in my life. Also walked them and played with them etc.

My wife was also around dogs as a child but never owned one.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We would love to rescue a dog. However, depending on the breed we heard that one needs to be careful with rescue dogs. The uncle I mentioned above recommend me to not get a rescue dogs as ""you can get a lot of baggage you do not know about"".

Any additional advice from you would be very welcome.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

A companion that loves being around my wife an me. He should be able to spend time with either me or my wife without ""missing"" the other too much.

He should be be able to hang on the couch for some time but also love walks/hikes/jogging and should not have problems with other dogs or children. We are not looking for a guard dog. However, there are a lot of children and other dogs around our neighbourhood.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I always likes Labradors, however we might think that they might be too big for a first time dog. I hear a lot of recommendation for this one as a first time/family dog. I also have a thing for Welsh Corgis. I understand that they might be very active.

We both find Beagles could fit us very well.

My wife likes Dachshunds and other smaller breeds. She would prefer a dog that she can lift up if the situation requires it.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Walking along side us, fetch, sit, speak/quite. The usual I guess. Nothing too exotic I think.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1 hour should be possible every day. More on the weekends.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I think 30mins each day are possible. We both jog every other day. So the dog would come with us. On the off days we would go for walks or play fetch in the yard.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We would prefer a shorter coat. If necessary all grooming will be done for the dog. A professional would be used if totally necessary but is not preferred.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and Slobber can be handled a lot. The neighbours would probably prefer the barking to be at minimum. However, they also have dogs and they sometimes bark too.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

We would love to let the dog run free in safe area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly most of the time.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Is ""somewhere in between"" a possible answer? 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

As mentioned, we are not looking for a guard dog. Knocking at doors should preferably not be a problem. If someone enters the yard, it would be good if he barks.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Would be great if the dog does not like to eat shoes, cables or tv remotes. But hey...thats just something you have to deal with when owning a dog.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home about 90%. On the days that I would not be at home, my wife could take the dog to work with her. I neither works, the dog would stay in the yard for about 8 hours. However, I cannot imagine that happening very often. 

If we would be gone for longer, my parents can take care of the dog. They also have a big yard.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My wife loves dogs and wants one too. We would share the involvement 50/50.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not at the moment. We might be expecting our first child in 1-2 years.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We own a house with a yard in the suburbs. No intention of renting.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

We live in Graz, Austria. No specific restrictions come to mind.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer 25 to 30 degrees celcius
Winter 5 to -10 degrees celcius

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We have a fenced yard that is about 120 square metres big.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

What do you guys think is the one thing that most newbies do not think about when getting a dog? We try to prepare as good as possible."
829,"[Discussion] Wow, kids be dumb. Parents need to do their job.",dogs,t3_a9pn7u,67,False,False,a9pn7u,"Christmas was interesting for our 3-month-old pup. He has met kids before when we take him to the park, but this week he met the family kids (ages 7-10). I thought they would be at least a little knowledgeable about how to behave with a dog because they all have their own. I definitely overestimated there.
 
The kids don't listen. The first thing they did was run screaming down the street towards me and the puppy. I held up my hand and yelled to stop and slow down. Kids continued and parents did nothing. 
 
Playing with my puppy involved chasing him, encouraging him to bite their hands and feet, backing him into corners, getting all up in his face... I tried so many times to stop the kids and explain that they needed to let pup get to know them, let him sniff them, etc and don't invade his personal space. I tried to teach them about his body language and when it means they should back off. They didn't adjust their behavior and I had to babysit.
 
Kids be dumb. One asked, ""How come he won't let me pet his belly?"" I'm like, ""How would you feel if someone you just met came up to you and rolled you onto your back to rub your belly?"" Didn't make the connection.
 
We went outside to walk pup after dinner. Kid comes with us. He's like, ""Are we gonna run him around soon? Cuz I'm getting bored."" I'm like, ""We're not out here to entertain you wtf?""
 
Most of my last two days have just been a stressful mess of me having to take my puppy away from the kids to protect him. Or getting discipliny with them because their parents are off having fun.
 
People kept asking me, why don't I take him off the leash inside? 1) because he is 3 months old and doesn't know how to stay alive and 2) the kids harass him.
 
I try to put pup down in his crate for naps and the kids come bursting in like ""NOOO why are you putting him in a cage??"" He's safe in there and it's naptime. How about someone put you in a cage."

Our in-laws love him but dont worry about or accept the same risks as us. For instance they let him out freely in the back yard (fenced) which concerns me because he likes to eat EVERYTHING. They don’t even crate him because my mother IL says it’s cruel to see dogs in crates, even after explaining how it works. We’ve never used the crate for punishment and at home, he even voluntarily goes in at bed time.

After the two times he has spent the night there, he’s refused to eat food for about 2 days. Could this be a stress response in reaction to not being in the crate or off his routine?"

I have no intention of trying to tell you how to teach your kids, but as a warning. My Husky is very easy going and I wasn't necessarily worried when it did happen, but you might not be so lucky with another dog. I had both my dogs unleashed at an off leash park with no one around and I was about 15 ft away when my husky was doing his business. He likes a little privacy when he goes #2. Right in the middle of his dump a small child screams ""husky"" out of nowhere and runs directly for him. Before I could even get to him the child was already petting him and running off before I could even say a word. Luckily my shepherd isn't to keen on small children so she just avoids them by going the opposite direction. I understand dogs are the best thing when you're a child, but you never know what is going to happen. Next time they might not meet a well mannered pup who loves kids, next time they might accidentally surprise the dog and get nipped, next time they might get bitten badly.

845,"[discussion] I think my friend is about to buy from a puppy mill, how can i best warn him?",dogs,t3_a9txaq,15,False,False,a9txaq,"Friend is looking for a puppy. He has his heart set on Australian Shepherds, and found one available nearby.

Some of the ""red flags"" I've picked up talking to him:

 * They're breeding ""mini"" Australian Shepherds. That alone put me on alert, at least.
 * I'm aware Australian Shepherds are a popular breed at the moment and fairly susceptible to this kind of thing to start with.
 * ""Breeder"" seems to only have one or a few pairs of dogs that they repeatedly breed, all parents live with the breeder both moms and dads.
 * hip/knee checks are limited to ""my local vet says the parents are good"" and I'm unsure about eye testing - all three are recommended by akc for Aussies.
 * Breeder has lied to him about what to expect from the breed. They told him a mini Australian Shepherd will be a ""great apartment dog"" and only need a short daily walk for exercise and no mention of mental stimulation at all. I'm not worried about his ability to exercise the dog, he's a fairly active guy, but intentionally misinforming your pup's new parent rubs me the wrong way.
 * He's having difficulty getting them to commit to a home visit for the puppies, so he can see them prior to pickup.
 * No wait list, no interview, no meeting. He saw an add, said ""do you have a puppy for me"" and they said yes.
 * The dogs are CHEAP. They're asking for $500 CAD for the puppies, when he States other breeders in the area (many of whom also sound shady) were asking for 1200-2k. Breeder claims that this and the previous two points are due to the fact this is her last litter and she's getting out of breeding, due to being older and having some health conditions.

I told him these are red flags, but I believe he's blinded by cute puppies, and the fact he can actually afford them. Is there any good explanation for even some of this, and if you're all as wary as I am, is there anything else I can do or say to change his mind? Puppy pickup wouldn't be for another two weeks I believe, so maybe there's time.

846,[Help] Breeders and health testing importance/transparency,dogs,t3_a9wcac,12,False,False,a9wcac,"I made a post a couple days ago asking for opinions on a particular breeder. This brought up a some questions for me regarding health testing. I had contacted and asked the breeder for documentation, or something similar, that I could see just so I could see if their dogs really were tested for PRA, MDR1, etc. I did not receive anything official from them besides reassurance that their results are accurate based on lineage (linage was not provided and I searched OFA but had no luck). Looking at other breeder sites I've seen some dogs that have a simple description like ""MDR1: normal/mutant,"" while others have full pedigrees and include registration numbers to make it easier to look up their dogs and such. Others mention the names/locations of doctors who have examined their dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

When contacting breeders what exactly is a good response when asking about health testing? Is official documentation (a record from OFA or some other form of documentation) the main way to validate health tests or is verbal conformation that they do health tests typically what you get (i.e. ""this dog is not a carrier for \_\_\_\_"") ? I personally feel like breeders should have some sort of proof to present buyers, but is this considered too demanding/rude? This is my first experience with a breeder and I am honestly not sure what would be considered acceptable/rude on my side regarding this. I would appreciate any input! "

848,[help] Extreme shedding all of a sudden,dogs,t3_a9x67e,3,False,False,a9x67e,"3 months ago we rescued a pit bull/Bassett hound mix who is approximately 2 years old. We have been feeding him Merrick food since day one and he has shed very little. 

With the last bag of Merrick food we purchased, we noticed the kibbles were larger which was odd. I emailed Merrick about it and they advised that the food can vary because it is all natural. My dog has never puked, but he has puked twice since starting this bag. My main concern is out of nowhere he has been shedding a TON. If you pet him, you end up with a hand full of hair. He has no bald spots but is shedding a ton. I returned the bag and switched to Acana food. 

My fiancé gave him a bath today, the hair covered the tub and clogged the drain it was so bad. We are worried sick about our boy. 

The only other change in our home was a real Christmas tree, but he hasn’t gone really close to it or eaten any pines needles. We live in Illinois so the climate is cold when he goes outside, but from what I’m reading dogs don’t really shed their coats this time of year. 

He is still 100% himself and active and doesn’t seem sick at all. Loves his food and is playful. Should we just give it a few days to see if it was the food? Get him to a vet immediately? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you in advance.

849,[Discussion] My family won’t stop feeding my dog. Who overcame similar situations?,dogs,t3_a9vlhu,9,False,False,a9vlhu,"I adopted an adult dog (6years) back in June and she’s had bouts of vomiting, butt licking, diarrhea , allergies and such so I am very cautious about what I feed her while determining (along w the vet) what we should and shouldn’t give her. Not only that but I have her at a healthy weight and wanna keep her there!!! With it being the holidays my family sees her a lot and they nonstop feed her “human food” She is the only dog in the family but all 20 of them go overboard. I have to bring her with because i travel 1-3 hours just to see the family so i don’t wanna leave her alone all day. i’m tempted to just stop visiting them if i don’t have someone to watch her.

Why do people suck? Advice or stories similar are welcomed. I didn’t know whether to post this as help or discussion. She is my first dog and i don’t want her feeling sick. "
850,[Help] 8 month old puppy isn’t confident and heavily relies on everything we do.,dogs,t3_a9orpv,21,False,False,a9orpv,"So the title may have been a little misleading, but I didn’t really understand how to word my issue. Basically, we got a puppy in June and we have had him since we was 5ish weeks old. He’s a small breed, and we tend to think that we’re pretty good puppy owners. Leo is usually around other humans for roughly 20% of the day considering we put him up when we leave the house. 

Now comes the frustrating part. We could leave Leo for 12+ hours (obvi we wouldn’t do that) and he wouldn’t whimper once. But, the second the door closes to the bathroom he’s screaming his head off. Similarly, we recently moved Leo to the back seat for car rides and needless to say he hates it. Not to mention he’s still very bitty and requires constant attention.

We love him very much and would never get rid of him, but we need some suggestions on how to:
    1. Stop the biting (or will is stop over time) ? 
    2. Allow Leo to understand that it will be ok if we don’t see each other for 5 seconds, or if he’s not in our arms in the front seat. 

I understand we may not have made some of the best decisions in the beginning of training, but we did the best we could. 

Edit: so funny story as to why we got him at 5 weeks. We needed something hypo allergenic and we searched for a rescue for awhile and then came across Leo on Craigslist for a small fee. They told us he was 8-9 weeks old which we fell for and mostly just fell in love. When we took him to the vet the vet immediately knew he wasn’t 8. "
851,[HELP] My small 6 lb. Chihuahua tore his Cranial Cruciate Ligament,dogs,t3_a9trqv,3,False,False,a9trqv,"My dog tore his CCL a few days ago.

852,[Help] Our 15 year old has giardia,dogs,t3_a9unaz,11,False,False,a9unaz,"Sorry if I’m not doing this properly, I read the rules but I have never posted in this sub before. 

Anyway, our 15 year old mixed breed (Aussie shepherd/cattle dog/lab; usually about 50lbs) started having diarrhea about a week ago. After it didn’t subside for a couple of days, we took her to the vet and they did some tests and she was positive for the giardia parasite. She has been having explosive/watery diarrhea for about a week now. She is otherwise very healthy for a 15 year old. Declining a bit due to hip issues, but healthy for her age.

She’s on metronidazole every 12 hours with a full meal (chicken and rice/bland diet) for 10 days, and liquid panacur once a day for 6 days. She’s been on the metronidazole for 5 days, and the panacur for 3 days. Her diarrhea is definitely still there. She’s having tons of diarrhea accidents at night and it’s starting to get more watery. 

Since she is a senior, this has definitely knocked her down. She’s weaker and usually INSANE about food but isn’t very interested in her chicken and rice. She was the first couple days but now only eats most of the chicken. I tried putting broth in it and it didn’t make a difference. I know side effects of both meds can cause loss of appetite but I’m worried because of her age and her love of food. She is down about 4 lbs from her normal weight. She’s still interested when we eat human food and interested in our other dogs food though. Oh and she’s drinking plenty of water/urinating regularly, which is good to see. 

So basically my questions are- has anyone had a senior dog with this parasite? Most people I have talked to had this in dogs under 1 year old. How long did it take for the diarrhea to go away and did they fully recover?

Also, is there something we can feed her besides rice for a bland diet? She likes chicken but I feel like she isn’t getting enough calories. 

Sorry this was so long! I would love any feedback.

853,[Help] Dog humping all the time,dogs,t3_a9uhde,0,False,False,a9uhde,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have an 8 year old female scottie mix who is spayed.  She is humping ALL THE TIME.  We adopted a new dog several months ago - a male catahoula mix - who she seems to genuinely like.  She will climb into his crate with him and sleep, they each sleep on the same bed most nights, and they spend a lot of time together outside.  She's older and doesn't like to fetch and while he'd love her to play with him more rough, she's older and that's not her style.  So, no signs of aggression, they share bones, no red flags.  


However, the blanket in her crib is CONSTANTLY being humped.  Like nonstop.  She's humping all day and night right now.  She has humped a couple of stuffed animals before but very rarely.  The humping started several weeks ago and seems to have reached a high right when we had holiday guests (that she knows very well and likes).  I don't know what to do but say ""stop"" but she will start up again, inevitably.  The humping doesn't seem to coincide with the other dog ""bothering"" her or invading her personal space and she is clearly the alpha in the house.  If he gets too involved or careless, she tells him to back off and he will roll over into a submissive pose.  He's still very much a puppy, you see, and sometimes gets rambunctious.  Still, that doesn't seem related.  She just had a vet checkup and nothing is amiss.  They say it is likely due to the new dog and it should subside but it only seems to have gotten worse.  


It's a really annoying behavior, TBH.  Is there a way to train her out of it.  I don't believe in punishing either one of them.  And, her being a terrier, she won't do anything she doesn't see in her best interest.  We do occasionally have to medicate her for OCD and anxiety so maybe that would help?  She's a very neurotic dog."

856,"[Help] Going to dog parks/swimming areas, and keeping doggy healthy.",dogs,t3_a9wkaq,5,False,False,a9wkaq,"Hey everyone.

So beyond ""make sure your dog's vaccinations are up to date"" I didn't think I'd have to take precautions regarding doggo's health at dog parks, but after I started taking her she started getting eye infections. Her eyes were red one after the other and weeping TERRIBLY.

So we figured it was the water she was drinking (she loves snorkelling) so I've been taking precautions with that.

But my question's not about the eye infections. That's just an example of how something I didn't see coming impacted our outings.

The question is, **what kind of other health-related precautions do I need to take when I take my dog out to the dog park**?

IE:

* Picking up after your dog to avoid spread of disease (duh)

* Vaccines (also duh)

* I've been taking her own bowl with us so that I know the water she's drinking is clean, since the bowls provided tend to get muddy, and even making sure to empty it out and refilling it wasn't enough.

* I've been flushing her eyes out with saline solution after she's gone swimming, because her favourite thing to do is snorkel. (IE, stick her head under the surface, walk around like that, lift head and shake all over innocent bystanders, rinse and repeat.)

I don't want to be paranoid, but I'm just wondering if there's ""common sense"" issues that I'm completely unaware of that I should take into account.

Our mother's also concerned that our dog will get ""parasites"" from swimming in the lagoon, but I asked her for info and her response was that she was concerned the doggo would get amoeba up her nose or something. I'm... not even sure we can get brain eating amoeba down here in Sydney but maybe there is a problem with waterborne pathogens and I need to take more precautions to keep my dog safe?

**TL;DR -- After taking doggo out to dog parks and swimming and having to flush her eyes/have her only drink from her own bowl to prevent infections, it's left me wondering what other precautions I should be taking that I'm not aware of to keep doggy healthy?**

Also, there's storm water drains nearby -- should I be letting doggo swim near that, or is it fine? It's definitely storm water, not sewage."

862,[Help] On Saturday I'll be taking away a neglected St. Bernard from my in-laws. How do we introduce him to our Maltese puppy safely?,dogs,t3_a9sazk,3,False,False,a9sazk,"On Saturday we'll take home a 4 year old St. Bernard from my wife's parents. He's spent the vast majority of his life locked up in a cage in their yard. He's been heavily neglected for the past almost 4 years, basically never played with, never groomed. His hair is under the neck and on legs is all tangled up and dirty. All they ever did was feed him. His water gets changed every couple days in the 20 liter bucket. You can imagine what that looks.

He hasn't received any kind of training. He likes us since we're the only ones who let him outside for a walk in the yard and play with him, but he's not very obedient of us, of course. I'd say he weighs around 65 kg (140 lbs). He's not been socialized with other dogs, and just introduced to a couple people.

Now I'm afraid how he'll react to our dog at home. The Maltese is 5 months old now. She's very curious, energetic, and fearless, which I fear could be to her detriment. I'm not sure how to approach introducing him to the puppy safely. He's not an aggressive dog, but I'm afraid he could get annoyed with her and bite her head off or something. So I'd like to avoid this. Them not ever seeing and meeting each other is not an option for me.

I also have some concerns about how he'll adapt to the new environment where he'll be free, and coming to another dog's territory, but that's a whole another issue. We're primarily concerned about the safety of the puppy, as I can see her being excited and jumpy around him. If not angry even. I'm not sure.

We'll also get the vet to come check him up immediately.

I have a 6 month old Siberian Husky, and she's the most energetic, crazy pup ever. She's literally always sprinting around the house and immediately demolishing any food we give her. That is, up until a day or two ago.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, she *always* eats her food. We've been training her to wait until we give her the go ahead so she doesn't just inhale it in two seconds. Either yesterday or the day before, though, she just kind of... stopped eating. She'll take a couple of bites of her breakfast in the morning and then leave it, then take maybe one bite around when she'd eat lunch, and then barely touch it during dinner time. She's still pooping normally which is strange to me because it doesn't seem like there's much going in, for there to be anything coming out.

&amp;#x200B;

She's hanging out at my mom's house tonight while I'm at work and my mom just told me that she ate some of her dinner and then promptly puked it all up and then some. She also didn't eat any of her breakfast this morning again.

867,[Breed] What breed is right for my family?,dogs,t3_a9uhrs,6,False,False,a9uhrs,"COPY/PASTE THE FOLLOWING FOR AUTO-FORMAT WITH BULLETS

Copy/paste the text below into a new text post..

Replace ""ANSWER"" with your response but do not delete the asterisk (*). Leave a space between the asterisk and your response.

Remember to include [Breeds] in the title of your post.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I grew up with dogs. They were all outside dogs and we lived in the country. I am in an urban area and am looking to get an inside dog.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I am wary of rescue's. I have children (3 &amp; 5), and their safety is my #1 priority. I would prefer to have a dog that could grow up with them in the house to avoid safety issues.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I would like to have a dog that isn't large (we own our house, but it isn't a big house). Is cat friendly, is excellent with kids, and is NOT high energy. Medium to small size would be best, with an excellent temperament. Also, I would like to avoid the smell of a hound (the beagle smell).

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Something like a Pug, that isn't all messed up. I really don't know what other medium to small breeds fit the bill of not requiring too much exercise.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands, sit, stay, recall.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work full time, so it will need be crated while I am at work (about 8 hours straight). I could probably make something work out while it was in the puppy stages to cut that timeframe different for awhile until it had a large enough bladder.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30 minutes to an hour. In the summer this number will be much higher since I like to hike (I would avoid hiking with the dog if necessary due to issues with its breed or size). 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Looking for as low maintenance as possible. Not looking to pay a professional. Maybe once a month.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Small to medium.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I would prefer less shedding and slobber. Barking I can handle as long as it can be contained by training.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important. If the dog is outside it will be on a leash or a lead.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I want it to be nice.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I don't have any tolerance for this.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggressiveness is a no go. I'm pretty hardline on this.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 8-9 hours a day while I am at work (at most, it varies with my wife's schedule).

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Their desires are reflected in this. I have two small kids (3 &amp; 6). My primary concern is that the kids are safe.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a house cat.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No. I own my house.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Ohio. I live in an unincorporated township.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers can easily hit in the 90's, winters can get pretty cold as well (30's).

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I am looking for a kid friendly, low maintenance dog that physically fits in our house and doesn't require a lot of exercise, but is able to hike.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

868,[fluff] Our Christmas Eve stray.,dogs,t3_a9p758,31,False,False,a9p758,"I’ve never posted before in this sub but I’ve been following for some time, I thought this made for a pretty good post/holiday. 

My husband works in the oil fields in the Midwest US. Right now our temps are slightly above zero, freezing rain, terrible awful weather. 
He was working on Christmas Eve (having a shitty day, so was I) and when he went to a disposal there was a border collie roaming around. Super friendly, showed up a few days ago but no one at the disposal knew her and no farmers live nearby for miles. 
Meanwhile, her entire butt is severely matted, full of dried dead worms, (who apparently couldn’t make it out of the matting) she’s extremely bloated from the infestation, hungry, cold, and her pads are frostbit. She was wearing what looked like a 20 year old collar with no tags and it’s not uncommon in this state to dump dogs before leaving for home (out of state), or cowboys that don’t give a 💩 about dogs (chained up outside in sub zero temps)

Husband realllllly tried to not add a second dog to our family.
But he brought her home. We had to shave the matting out (she couldn’t actually go to the bathroom because the matting was so thick). We’ve fed her teeny meals throughout the day so it didnt’t shock her system, she actually managed to poop (hurray!) and she’s getting along pretty well with our resident (also adopted) male dog. They’ve had some vocalizations but nothing violent. Thank god. 
She’ll be going to the vet soon (within a week) to get looked at and get her shots.  She’s having a little hard time breathing, and she’s pretty lethargic and tired, but she really wants to be spunky and puppyish. We suspect maybe lungworms or an upper respiratory infection from eating roadkill/weather, so fingers crossed for minor health problems instead of anything severe!
And before anyone says it, yes, all precautions were taken, our dog is up to date on all vaccinations and he’ll be receiving a round of wormer with her, they use separate areas of the yard and have their own space (just to clear that up). My husband has vet experience and grew up in a vet family so, we’re definitely alright. 

It’s funny to say, We were thinking about adding a second dog to our family for a while but decided to keep the space open because we seem to always stumble upon the dogs that really need help. I’m so glad we waited. 

Her name is Eve. 
Yes, I was going to default to Santa’s Little Helper if no one decided a name. 
If anyone has any tips for maintaining a peaceful environment between a resident and new dog, that would be great! Maybe ways to help them bond a little better? Or stories of how your dogs bonded, how long it took, do they just tolerate each other or actually care etc. This will be my first time having two dogs (not my husband’s), so I’d love to hear your experiences. 
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

My physical conditions are tied to severe nerve  pain that's uncontrolled much of the time.  I sorted spend most of my  time home alone and really need a reliable pup pal to help keep me  company, but I'm going to have to be pretty specific about what things I  need and can tolerate and it's going to be difficult. You are all  smarter and more experienced than I am, especially considering I've  never owned a dog before.

This is what  I'm really going to have to consider before I move on with my thoughts.   I need to clear with my housing authority first, but the pet policy is  pretty open.

I will need to be looking at:

A medium (not small, please) sized dog with a low shed potential

A cuddle pup, one that won't mind climbing up with me on the bed and hanging out

Low  activity as far as room to run out high energy.  I am in a quiet,  somewhat rural neighborhood, but I can't have a high energy dog that had  to run, especially because I'm on a hill.  I have a park at the base of  my high energy that will be acceptable for walking.

I  know age is going to be a big thing when it comes to a tempered dog,  like no new pups for example.  I'm thinking 4-5 years, though I'll not  sure if it's a good goal or not.  I just don't want one that will pass  within a couple of years.

What breeds do you suggest?  What I do I need to learn first?  Male or female are both acceptable!

870,[Fluff] Skittish Rescue Remembers Home,dogs,t3_a9kl38,9,False,False,a9kl38,"I adopted a skittish rescue last winter, about 2-3 years old. He is very calm and gentle, hardly ever bark. I tried not to give him anything free; he is always asked to sit or do something for his meals and treats as I read that it is a good way to boost dogs confidence. But he still gets very scared so easily that he pees uncontrollably if we bump each other at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we went for a long walk all the way into the woods at the end of my apartment complex. I often have him off leash as he listens to me. Even if he runs off to chase a squirrel, he doesn't go far and comes back. It was different today; he chased something (for some reason, yelping while chasing), and I didn't realize the fence wasn't complete. He ran off and disappeared. I called his name and tried to find him in the woods for a while, to no avail. I realized I wouldn't be able to find him and walked back home. He wasn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought someone eventually would call me since he has a collar with my number, and he's microchipped. About 30 minutes later, I heard a bark (I don't recognize his bark as I only heard him barking a few times for the entire year). I thought it would be another dog somewhere, but opened the front door just in case. There he was sitting in front of the door. What a good boy.

873,[Breeds] What Type of Dog Would You Recommend for Me?,dogs,t3_a9u29m,10,False,False,a9u29m,"\*\*So I am finally paying off my student loans this week, and told myself I would not buy a dog until I paid them off. Now I am starting my search for my first ever dog (did not have one growing up) and could not be more excited! If you all could offer any help regarding the breed I should get or general advise, I would greatly appreciate it.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Growing up my family had a farm dog and some farm cats, but that was when I was in elementary school. I have not had any pets since then, though I begged and begged my parents for a dog with no luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I do not have a preference; however, if going through a breeder for a specific type of dog will reduce the risk of my dog having health issues, then I have no problem going that route.

&amp;#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* I want a dog who is fun and active and can hangout with me in the Texas heat outdoors, but when it comes time to relax at night, I want my dog chilling out with me. I'm a bit of an old man and don't do anything but relax past 9 PM during the week and go to bed around 11.

&amp;#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* On an average weekday, I would be able to take my dog on an hour long walk/run. I have dog parks in the area and my apartment complex will be finishing their dog park this coming spring, so those are an option as well. On the weekends I could spend  lot more time giving my dog exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would like a dog that is eager-to-please.

&amp;#x200B;

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* On an average week, I work 8-5 but can come home during lunch for 30 minutes. After work, I come home and then go to the gym from around 6:30 to 8:30. I am then at home the rest of the night and usually go to sleep at around 11. However, I do travel monday through thursday every once in a while and my family has agreed to watch my dog for those weeks I do travel. Either it be my sister, grandma, or parents.

874,[Breed] What dog breed is right for me?,dogs,t3_a9u23k,4,False,False,a9u23k,"Introduction

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my boyfriend and I's first dog as independent adults. We both grew up with dogs and I have been the primary care-taker/carer of our dogs since I was 12 (this includes an old special needs dog, and then a boxer and husky puppy which I raised, both of which turned out lovely and well behaved). 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I would prefer to rescue a dog, though my boyfriend has never had a puppy and wants to have one at least once so I agreed that if we can't find a puppy that fits our lifestyle in a rescue within ~6 months then we can begin looking for a reputable breeder. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.

While I personally don't mind energetic or vocal dogs (I love my husky more than anything) we will be in a one or two bedroom apartment with overall very limited space. So I would need a dog that is quiet and has at least controlled energy similar to a greyhound. I enjoy outdoor activities so it will be exercised but I don't want it to tear up my apartment if I miss a day. I also prefer dogs that are smart and think for themselves. Ex. In the case of my husky and boxer, the husky is very intelligent and quickly learned many tricks, but only performs them if he recognizes a mutual benefit. Whereas the boxer is very difficult to train but eager to please. She understands all of two commands but performs them with so much enthusiasm lol. I find it more endearing that my husky is so independent and headstrong but actively chooses to obey and be affectionate with me, whereas my boxer is just happy and obedient with everyone and no matter what so it takes away from the depth of the connection for me for some reason.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I prefer mutts, and otherwise the dogs I like are not well suited to apartments so I'm not entirely sure about this one.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I'd like for my dog to know basic commands at the very least, but I find that even the slowest of dogs (my boxer lol) are capable of learning basic commands so I'm not too worried about this. If they can be trained further that would be fun but I know that typically tends to pertain to higher energy breeds.

Care Commitments

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I am stuck at the hip to my dogs, so most of my time at home is spent with them. Focused one on one training I could do at least a couple hours a day until they're older, which would taper off to one hour.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

My boyfriend and I both enjoy going on walks so they'll probably get at least one long walk a day, maybe two. There are no dog parks in his area but local general recreational parks will be visited frequently where there are other people and dogs to interact with. Would occasionally visit trails but they're far off from our city apartment so not a regular thing.

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

More than happy to do any grooming tasks, I work at a vet clinic and am capable of doing most basic things but for any advanced/styled hair cuts (ie. Poodles, etc) I wouldn't mind visiting a professional groomer.

Personal Preferences

9) What size dog are you looking for?

I tend to prefer larger dogs but I'm not picky. I'm inclined to say a medium size breed would be better as I wouldn't want a large dog to be uncomfortable in cramped quarters.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I don't mind shedding at all, the boyfriend isn't a huge fan but it's not a deal breaker for him. Would prefer less slobbering but again not a deal breaker. Cannot be very vocal though unfortunately, I will miss my Husky's singing voice for sure!

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It's not very important to me as there are limited scenarios wherein my dog would be allowed off leash, but if they can be trained to do so it's definitely not a bad thing.

Dog Personality and Behavior

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly to the max lol

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I'd prefer one that does it's own thing but still enjoys my company. 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

An unreactive dog would be better, as it cannot be very loud, and while I am ok with putting in the extra work to socialize particularly anti-social breeds, it would be nice if they were at least indifferent or receptive to meeting strangers and visitors. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Yes

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I would like to avoid loud/vocal breeds.

Lifestyle

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Each week-day they would be left alone for ~6-8 hours depending on my classes and work schedule, but my boyfriend has finished school so he works 6am-4pm so he's consistently home in the evenings regardless. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Boyfriend is on the same page for the most part, no major disputes. He will help in taking care of the dog when I'm not home but I will be the primary care-taker.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We would like to have a cat or two and possibly other various small pets later on.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Boyfriend has a 4 y.o. niece who will visit occasionally.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No known restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Metz, France. In the past pitbull and mastiff type breeds have been banned, and supposedly still are, though they're common in the area so I'm not 100% sure on the situation and there's no info online, but to be safe will avoid these breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Moderately cold winters, 20-30F and little snow. Very warm summers 70-80F.

Additional Information and Questions

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Any mix of breeds is ok as well. I'm not too heart-set on any specific breed as I know each dog is an individual and tends to conform to their home lifestyle when brought home at a young age, but still would like to have a feel/expectation for the breed as a whole.

875,[Help] Does this look like Syringomyelia?,dogs,t3_a9uy1f,2,False,False,a9uy1f,"Just took my dog for a walk and my little guy is doing what appears to be a classic sign of syringomelia. He also definitely shows sensitivity around his neck and head and yelps if someone touches him there sometimes...He is 1.5 years old and I got him from a reputable breeder intentionally to mitigate the risks of him getting this condition (his dad is a champion show dog and comes from a good line of dogs).

Obviously bringing him to the vet but since it's late at night was just curious to hear all of your thoughts... video at the link

876,[Fluff] Some Christmas drama courtesy of our pup,dogs,t3_a9h1yf,76,False,False,a9h1yf,"Our 1.5 year old chocolate lab snuck up to the closet where we were hiding the Christmas gifts last night around 11pm. He found a pound of chocolate-covered raisins and ate them... all of them. We had a holy-shit moment as we collectively realized... Chocolate: bad. Raisins: worse! 

Thankfully, we discovered what he'd done relatively quickly. I called our vet's emergency number and the sweetest woman on planet Earth talked me through getting my dog to ingest some hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting, which worked right away. We've been keeping an eye on him, and it's now more than half a day later with no apparent illness, so I think we dodged a bullet.

This dog, man. He's a handful and a half but I just can't stay mad at him, especially on Christmas."
877,[Help] 10 year old dog - Collapsed trachea &amp; enlarged heart advice,dogs,t3_a9opmr,11,False,False,a9opmr,"I'm looking for any advice for my current situation. Our 10 year old family dog, Ozzy (Cairn Terrier Jack Russell Mix), has been dealing with a collapsed trachea and enlarged heart for a little over a year now. That's roughly when the coughing started.

I've watched it slowly progress into something that truly breaks my heart to see/hear. We've taken him to the vet many times, and have been given codeine + a water pill, since apparently he had excess fluid build up. He has moments where he is quiet, but even then, I notice this constant heavy breathing, almost like he is struggling. When he gets into a coughing fit, it has evolved from the standard ""goose"" sounding honk that comes from the cough, to more a sound that I can only describe as similar to when a human has a really ""airy"" and long laugh that comes more from them exhaling a ton/pushing air out. These can last for 5-10 minutes, and he will either pace around, or lay down with belly facing the ground, front paws out ahead, and resting his chin on them. He's recently got into sneezing fits during these episodes as well. 

The medicine we were given, I imagine, stops these episodes from happening more frequently, but any time he gets excited (which is a lot), they start up. We also have a 3 year old Black Lab/Shepard Mix, who is very gentle with Ozzy, but in recent times hasn't been able to play with him because of these episodes. It's difficult because some nights he'll sleep through the night, and other times he'll have us all up with that cough and breathing issues. The water pill also has him going out more, as expected, but he's recently started to have some accidents on the cough, which I'm presuming happen while he's coughing. 

His appetite is still pretty good during all of this, and you can tell his still has energy when we let him out, because he'll run as fast as he can (even though he'll start coughing during this). I guess I just don't know what to do. It really seems to me as if he is suffering more than he is ""calm"". Surgery for him is out of the question, especially for his age. I don't know whether I need to start thinking about having him put down, or do I try to get a second opinion somewhere else? 

I love this dog so much, but I hate seeing him suffer and just want to make sure I'm making the right decision.

Any advice/suggestions from you guys would mean a lot. Thanks!

She’s 10 months old now &amp; her temperament is stubborn, lazy, and loving. Very sweet and interested in smelling everything. She’s almost 60lbs. Makes a clicking nose when outside smelling the ground. Everyone is her new best friend.

We got a puppy pug. He's now 6 months. So often during the day, the older pug will find one of the puppy's toys and pee on it. Which prompts him to think it's time to pee and will pee right next to it.

This will happen even if they've been outside just half an hour before. When they're outside, when one pees, the other will likely pee right on top of that spot. This can go back and forth sometimes up to three times.

How do I stop this behavioral problem in both animals? The older dog showing that it's okay to pee indoors is not acceptable behavior and is teaching the pup very bad habits."

But of you cuddle one of them, he “purrs” and it is LOUD. Our other dog does it too but not as often or as loud. At first I thought maybe we were hurting him somehow by cuddling and he was trying to tell us? But nope. Asked the vet at our annual visit and they said it’s pretty common.

Will the sex of the dog make a difference to its personality, if so, would you recommend male or female for my preferences?

I also understand that golden retrievers can be prone to some conditions such as skin conditions, is there another breed which is similar in temperament and personality which aren't prone to health issues?

Is there anything else I should know about or consider when it comes to what breed or age of dog?

Thanks!

Sometimes he'll just be chilling, and then he'll sit up, and have a good long pant, for 5 minutes or more. Really deep, loud panting, like he's just gone for a run or something. Then he'll chill again,

He's always done it to some degree, but it feels like it's gone up a notch. It is summer here, but even in the colder months he was doing it.

 1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

No.

 1. Describe your ideal dog.

A big affectionate dog that's up for a long hike but able to relax and nap when we're done. My only complain with the current dog (Aussie Shepherd) is he doesn't EVER turn off. I'll run him 6 miles hard and he still wants non stop playtime all day. It can get a little frustrating. 

 1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Wife is interested in Golden and Labs, I like greater Swiss, Bernese mountain dog, saint Bernard, Irish wolfhound. Again, we'd like bigger, a little calmer, and affectionate. 

 1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Hiking above all. Long car rides - often times to more hiking. And must be a good family companion. 

Care Commitments

 1. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We have opposite work schedules so the crate/alone time can be minimized.

Yes yes and yes

Personal Preferences

 1. What size dog are you looking for?

Big. Like 90 pounds or more

 1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and slobber we're not overly concerned with. The house is already full of dog hair and our current dog is a kisser. Barking we'd like to keep down if possible. 

 1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

He/she needs to be okay at a dog park

886,[help] any kennel cough home remedies?,dogs,t3_a9vxx3,1,False,False,a9vxx3,"Hello all,

I’m here to talk about my little guy Benny. The fiancé and I adopted him last Sunday. Sunday he was fine, Monday he was fine, Tuesday he was perfect. Before we went to bed Tuesday night, he coughed out a little bit of flem. We made nothing of it, and got some sleep. Wednesday we woke up, and he had been throwing up white foamy “flem” and it persisted all morning, afternoon, and evening. We have an appointment for him tomorrow. The assumption is that he has kennel cough. He was vaccinated for it early December. When we called the adoption center, they called us over to go pick up antibiotics, which he later threw up. Now we have an appointment tomorrow morning, but we are are obviously very concerned. Is there something we can give him just to get us, and most importantly him through these next 10+ hours? 
We are camping out with our little buddy in the living room tonight. Will probably be up most of the night. 

So far the only thing he has been able to hold down is some chicken. He held it for about 45 minutes. Any times he drinks, or eats his kibbles, he throws up. He’s been throwing up randomly. Now he’s just laying in his little bed next to us. 

We were told not to take him to urgent care considering because they didn’t deem it to be serious enough.

887,[help] my old man,dogs,t3_a9vsot,3,False,False,a9vsot,"I've had my old friend for almost 11 years- ever since I adopted him at 8 weeks at an animal shelter I worked at. He's been a great companion for most of my adult life. 

But just within the past couple of years, there's been a decline in his overall health and personality. He stopped eating for awhile and I started using wet dog food to help entice him to eat his dry. (He's now on a grain free dry mix that he eats with interest) 

He started getting a bad rash during the summer so I thought it was seasonal allergies, but it stuck around. I'm giving him weekly baths with 3 different shampoos to help with his itch (which they do greatly!) Where he chewed most of the hair off on his hind end, it is growing back in. 

He started going to the bathroom in my daughter's room and just recently would pee on the Christmas tree, all while we are home and able to let him out. He basically stopped telling us he needs to go outside. So he has to be in an office when we aren't home. And 10/10 he uses the bathroom in the office which has been a big stress at home. The other night, we were home all day and he was let out many times, but he still went in my daughter's room to poop while we were in another room.

He acts like he can't hear us at all. Walking up to him and brushing past him makes him jump. And he basically ignores us or looks at me blankly when I groom him or pet him. He use to show an expression of love or Joy whenever I sit next to him now it's kind of blank or sad.

It has been stressful the past year or so and we are on a tight budget currently so I can't take my 65+lb dog to the vet and afford the check up.

I guess what I am asking for is advice. Someone asked me if it's time to put him down. But I felt like it was only necessary if he was in pain. I'm not sure if he's in pain. He just isn't the same dog anymore and it's sad with him seeming so depressed and disconnected.

893,[Help] Is my diffuser making my dog sick?,dogs,t3_a9rf5x,2,False,False,a9rf5x,"Hi all. I'm new to this community and I am on mobile fyi.

I got a nice diffuser for Christmas and I'm in love with it! Problem is that I just read that it may be harmful to dogs, I'm seeing conflicting articles online about it. I don't know if it is just from injestion from the oils or the smells that cause them harm (or none).

Now background: My dog puked three times today and yesterday (total not each day). Once in my basement, once in the car, and once in the kitchen. I assume the car and kitchen one was from the car ride, because she gets carsick.  As for the time in the basement: that is not where I keep the diffuser. She has always been a puker because she eats grass and socks (we are trying to get her not to eat them and take them away when we see her have them).

Anyway, I assume they are unrelated to the diffuser, but I need to know because I am an extrenely paranoid person and obviously don't want to hurt my dog. If it is the diffuser, should get rid of it or at least not keep it on near my dog? Thank you.

894,[Help] 4yo dog tore her ACL,dogs,t3_a9p2ir,13,False,False,a9p2ir," My 4.5-year-old doggo has torn her ACL, and my heart is broken for her. She has had a minor limp for awhile that comes and goes and the vet suspected arthritis. Now a few days ago, the limp suddenly got so bad and she refuses to bear weight on it. I brought her in again and after xrays, the vet suspects a torn ACL, as well as arthritis. 

The vet told me I have two options - $4K surgery or strict rest and anti-inflammatories for life. She and I are both very active, and since she’s so young, I feel like the surgery is non-optional. She’s everything to me and it feels so awful to watch her have to lay around all day with no exercise. However, I’m fresh out of grad school, and $4K is going to be such a tough amount of money to come up with. 

Looking for any advice, similar experiences, words of wisdom, words of encouragement anyone might have.

We live in the Twin Cities in Minnesota. I’m wondering if there are any less expensive options out there - maybe surgery through the University? Is that a thing? We’re also struggling with stairs during this rest time - she’s not supposed to be climbing up stairs or jumping on furniture, but she weighs 50 lbs and it’s tough for me to carry her up 3 flights.

897,[Breeds] Is a Silken Windhound or a Windsprite right for me?,dogs,t3_a9plbi,1,False,False,a9plbi,"Formatting is off, sorry!

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first, I have two herding breeds that I got when I was in my mid-20's - I adopted an adult from a show-line breeder and purchased one as a puppy from a working-line breeder.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I'm certain that I'll only be able to get either a Silken Windhound or Windsprite from a breeder, so I'll go that route. I'm okay with either an adult needing to be rehomed or a puppy.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* What I'm looking for in this particular dog is a nice house pet that's ready to play/train/work when asked, but also okay with relaxing when asked. We have a fairly laid-back lifestyle so I'm looking for a dog that will be okay with that. My two current dogs are extremely willing-to-please herders, but that level of biddability is not something I'm necessarily looking for in my next dog. Trainability for basic manners is a must. It would also be really nice to have a dog we can bring to cafes and shops and such.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Silken Windhound or a Windsprite, but I'm not sure about the difference between the breeds. We've been involved with greyhound breed rescue in the past and enjoy sighthounds.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* This dog will primarily be a pet, although it would be nice to dabble in agility or coursing with it. I take agility classes with my current, younger dog, and I'm hoping to compete with her someday. We've actually had quite a few sighthounds in our agility classes, and it'd be nice to try it out with a Windhound or Windsprite, although I'm 100% aware that the training process will be vastly different with a sighthound than with my balls-to-the-wall herder. I take rally classes with my older dog, and we hope to compete someday, as well.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* To be honest, I wouldn't be *that* interested in training with this dog other than basic manners or CGC-type training, and possibly dabbling in agility. This dog would primarily be a companion animal. If it happens to take to agility, I would of course be ecstatic about that and pursue it, but I'm not expecting it to be a fantastic sports dog right out of the gate. 

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* 1 hour of walks or leashed hikes daily. There's a fenced park right next to our house that would be ideal for off-leash running if needed. My current dogs and I hike off-leash almost every day, and we put on a lot of miles during the weekend.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Yes to everything, would be willing to brush briefly daily.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-large. I've fostered greyhounds in the past and found them to be lovely dogs, but too large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle a moderate amount of shedding and barking, but I hate slobber.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* My current dogs are great off-leash, and I walk them off-leash in the woods every day. However, I'm not necessarily looking for that in my next dog and am 100% okay with them being leashed at all times.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine, but snuggly is better. I understand that sighthounds can be a bit aloof, and I'm okay with that.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either is fine.

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* My preference is that they'd greet strangers and visitors with friendly curiosity rather than a boisterous, loud greeting. I'm okay with alert barking.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, especially because I have two current, resident dogs. My house is not set up for a crate-and-rotate situation, nor am I willing to manage that behavior.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Human or dog aggression/reactivity, resource guarding, escape artists. Prey drive *may* potentially be an issue (please see below).

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* We have regular, full-time work schedules, so potentially up to 10 hours a day. We already hire a dog walker to come mid-day for our current dogs. We also send our dogs to daycare 2 times a week.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My partner likes dogs and would help with 50% of caring for the dog, except for the sports-related and training activities - I'd be doing all of that.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* So this is the main problem I might be up against. I have two cats, which may pose a problem with prey driven sighthounds, but I'm hoping that raising a puppy or adopting a cat-friendly adult will help with that.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes. We have relatives with small children (1-6 years of age). We'd supervise all interactions and would crate/separate when necessary.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Nope, we own our house.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in the United States. Sighthounds aren't banned here.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* We live in New England; summers here can range from 70-95 F and winters can range from -10-40F with snow and ice. We're willing to invest in clothing to keep a sighthound warm during the cold winter months.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* I'd like to know what the differences are between Silken Windhounds and Windsprites. My understanding is that Windsprites will be extremely close (if not identical) to Whippets in temperament, but my understanding of Windhound temperament is a bit unclear. I've met a couple in the past and they've seemed very typically sighthound in personality. They were a bit aloof, loved to nap, and had gentle, mild temperaments. One of the Silken Windhounds I met was good off-leash, but I understand that this may be the exception rather than the rule."
898,[HELP] What should I pay attention to when choosing a purebred dog? (Concerning the dog's health!),dogs,t3_a9xzwr,14,False,False,a9xzwr,"Disclaimer: I don't condone inbreeding in ANY kind of dog and I think it's horrible how people will breed a dog so it can't breathe (all kinds of bullies and pugs), walk when it's slightly older (German shepherd), and other cruel issues that will hurt the dog in its life. I am however inexperienced and would like to learn from you guys how to best go about getting a puppy that won't suffer in life because of asshole breeders.

&amp;#x200B;

Facts:

I would like to have a medium sized dog close in appearance/character to a border collie. I just love how they look, how smart they are, and how active they are. I intend to get such a dog mostly because it will be an incentive for me to exercise, and I'd love teaching him or her new tricks and keep him/her busy.

It does not HAVE TO BE a purebred dog and in fact I would PREFER a non pure-breed but with a LOT OF BORDER COLLIE in it so it retains characteristics (size, cuteness level, etc, most of this is personal preference, some of it, such as size, is practicality).

As this point I am NOT really considering adopting a shelter dog as my family has had trouble (real, real trouble) with them in the past, and I simply have (learned) too much respect of dogs' teeth to be comfortable with a dog I haven't raised myself. (Feel free to change my mind.)

&amp;#x200B;

All right. I've long thought about getting a dog and will probably think a while longer until I'm sure I want to be THIS responsible (I have a track record of being irresponsible that I'm trying to change). A discussion with my partner last night made me think and research more closely into health-issues purebred dogs can have.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two questions in particular:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) If we get a purebreed dog, what should we look out for? My partner says it's a matter of looking at a family tree and seeing if at some point in the dog's ancestry (although no further back than say great-grandparents) the dog's line was mixed with some other breed, which would minimize the chance of dog suffering from some sort of inbreeding condition. Is it that simple?

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Is it possible to find a breeder who will deliberately mix in a different breed every once in a while to ensure the dogs are as healthy genetically as they can be?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else we should consider before getting a dog? The actual acquisition of the dog might still be some time off, but I'd like to know as much as possible beforehand to prepare for it."

I’m fostering a 2 year old Boston terrier that hates everyone except for a few people (she is very sweet and loving with me, my boyfriend, and a few other select women) and I’m trying to curb this behavior. It’s not just that she’s scared or dislikes other people- she can be downright aggressive. Lunging, growling, barking. I don’t know if she’d actually bite someone and I obviously haven’t tested it. She does it no matter where we are (though I’ve been trying to not take her in public until I know how to handle this), though she’s specifically much worse with men and she’s MUCH worse at home than anywhere else. 

This is something I knew I would have to deal with (she was like this at the shelter too, I actually was only able to take her on because I work there and she really took to me while I was working with her. They would not adopt her to anyone or allow the general public to foster her), but now that I have her I’m not sure how to handle it because I’m so afraid of her biting someone (shelter policy is that if she bites and it breaks skin/needs any medical attention, she’ll be put down basically. It’s harsh) that I don’t even know how to begin working with this. I have some very understanding friends that are willing to help me, as well as the entire shelter staff, but I’m not sure what the best way to go about this is so that I don’t make the behavior worse. I don’t want to make anything worse by trying to help. It’s worth noting she’s extemely protective over me. She’s aggressive with new people regardless, but she’ll even growl at my boyfriend, whom she loves in general, if we play wrestle or he accidentally hits me or something. 

Thank you guys so much in advance! I really appreciate the help. I’d like to add she came from a pretty shitty home so your probably sad assumptions about why she hates men and acts this way are most likely valid. "

Hello, I’m looking to see if other people have had similar experiences and if there’s any tips or strategies anyone could offer. So my sister has a 1 year old Golden Retriever and he can be quite aggressive. When he was a few months old he started to resource guard, take his toys into his crate and growl if you went near him when eating. He’d also pounce on you if you went into his crate to clean. 

As he’s gotten older he’s started to become aggressive in that you could be petting him and he’s enjoying it then he’d turn so quickly and snap at you. He’s caught my sister a few times and he bit a close family friend who the dog has known since he was a puppy, it was so bad she had to get a tetanus shot. 

He’s snapped at my oldest niece for petting him and my sister doesn’t let her toddler anywhere near him without his muzzle on as she’s scared that he may snap at her. 

The resource guarding has gotten better, as in you can be near him when he eats just no touching. He also does lunge for anything thats not his and does usually give it up with no treat. It’s more the petting issue. He does warn you when he’s had enough as he will lower his head and there’s a twitch in his upper lip that if you don’t stop he’s going to attack. 

It’s certainly not what I would say is normal for the breed and he’s not suffered anything traumatic since my sister bought him from the breeder though I cannot for sure say nothing happened to him when he was with his litter. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this or are there any tips anyone could suggest? 

Edit: Just an edit I’ve mentioned in a reply but I should set the record straight. Regarding the muzzling this was a misunderstanding by myself. He wares a halter to help with lead training which doesn’t cover the full mouth it’s a band over the mouth to help control him when he’s out as he’s quite strong and used to pull when he was younger. He’s actually really good outside and there’s never been a problem with aggression or anything of the sort when he’s out walking. "
904,[HELP] How much do Pomeranians shed around the house?,dogs,t3_a9szel,11,False,False,a9szel,"I finally got permission to get a dog but preferably one that doesn't shed much. From my research I understand this breed sheds a lot, however it can be controlled by brushing, baths, diet, etc. This is a breed I'm very interested in and am really trying to find a way to calm my parent's worry about the shedding.

I plan to buy a Roomba to deal with lose fur on the floor and am willing to brush the dog daily for 15-30 min. Of course I'll also give the pom baths as often as the vet recommends and a diet recommended by a vet as well. Is that enough to deal with the shedding? A little dog hair getting everywhere isn't a huge issue but if it's balls of hair or covering all the furniture then it'll become one. I'm not too keen on brushing the dog AND vacuuming the furniture daily to keep my parents happy so if it comes to that this might not be the breed for me. "

**My dog**:

* I've had my dog Roman since he was 8 months old. He is a rescue, pitbull terrier mix (45 lb) and is 4 years old
* He was abused before and so is scared of a lot of things.
* He has bitten 1 of my brothers friends a couple years ago
* He lunges at other dogs and people he dosent know. Once he knows someone thought he is an awesome dog.
* very attached to me get nervous if I leave the house for 10 minutes but seems fine with my work schedule just not when I come back and try to leave again.

**The situation**

My girlfriend and I, who I lived with broke up and so now its just me and Roman. I moved to a new state because I just changed career paths. I have paid thousands for training and his hip surgery. I also pay a lot to have a dog walker come every day in the middle of the day to take him out and hang out with him for 30 minutes. I also cook his meals cause he loves it.

My family are not dog people so I constantly hear how a young professional shouldn't have a dog and I should give him up and so on. Ive been told to give him up and get a dog who is friendly and trained from a breeder.

**My Question**

What can I do? I cant have people over I cant take him to other people's places, no dog parks. How can I make him this happy dog I can take to a barbecue and let go without worrying? Im in the beginning of my career and I cant spend too much money but I am willing to commit time and effort.

Also any advice on how a single person can manage a social life when they live with a dog (also travel once in a while)? Would getting a second dog give him a buddy to hang out with while I'm at work or the gym?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am getting so frustrated and I just wanna hear from some dog lovers who understand that giving up my dog is not an option."

My wife and I have been together for 4 years and married for a little over a year now. We're both active duty military and was stationed in separate states prior to moving in with one another. Well I proposed in 2016 and luckily she said yes but out of the blue she just needed to have a dog.  I told her we're in the middle of planning a wedding and now wouldn't be a great time to purchase one.  I said wait until after we live together then we can get one. That wasn't good enough she pestered me for weeks to buy a dog and after weeks of bothering me like an idiot I told her yes.(first of many mistakes) She didn't just go to a shelter and adopt one like a normal person she goes and spends $3000 on a French bulldog(Yes, $3000 for a French bulldog in the middle of planning a wedding) She wanted surgery done so she shelled out another $8000 for her surgery and $2000 for boarding/training for the new puppy.  Yes within a month my wife drops 5 grand on a puppy.  She's excited and I'm annoyed haven't met the dog and already aggravated.  When I visit her in Virginia(I was living in Maryland) I finally saw him and he was a cute little thing but I noticed something(first red flag) she always kept him in the kitchen away from the house.  I'm not a dog person by any means but even I understand that you can't keep them in the crate away from everyone all day that's just cruel.  So I gave her some suggestions about how to be a better pet owner.  Then she asked me could I let him outside?  Nothing crazy about that but she never put him on a leash just allowed him unrestricted access to the yard because it was easier that way.  Then every time I visited her she asked me if I could walk, feed, and give her dog potty breaks and would get upset if I didn't. Quick story I don't dislike dogs but after my baby sister was mauled by a great Dane and needed stiches in her foot I've been cautious of them. It didn't help that I was chased by a stray Rottweiler for 6 blocks when I was younger so don't have warm memories of them. Finally we get married and after months of this I get fed up and confront her about it.  Why do you pawn him off on me when I'm around it seems like you don't want to fully take care of him.  She told me that I'm her husband and it's my job to help her take care of him.  If you don't help me with him this is going to cause issues in our marriage now suck it up and deal with it.  As much as I didn't like that answer like a fool I shut up and dealt with it.  I asked her to potty train and house break him before we move in together.  She tells me she will deal with it when the time comes.  Well fast forward to when we finally move in together and he pees on the floor within 24 hours of moving in.  I look at her and just shake my head and she gives me an uneasy I'm sorry.  Then after living with her for the past few months she's pawned 90% of the responsibilities on me. Now she hardly feed him, take him outside to relieve himself, bathe him, train him etc.  He's still not house broken and pretty much sits in a 8x6 pen all day.  I told my wife that I'm not helping her spend 2000 on training if she's unwilling to follow the instructions given to us by the trainers.  The breaking point for me was she got upset about having to take him outside to use the bathroom. We just had our child (as cute as she is she's a handful) and now Kuro(the Frenchie's name) is second to her.  My wife makes no effort to spend time with him, walk him, etc.  I understand that my daughter is a lot to deal with while I'm at work but my wife got overwhelmed with him as a puppy and needed help taking care of him.  Maybe I'm being selfish but I work a second job on top of being active duty military, I'm in school(take two classes every 8 weeks so that I can obtain my bachelor's degree), I just recently welcomed a baby girl into my life, my mother was diagnosed with Lupus and diabetes, and I'm also preparing to leave the military in the next 16 months.  Wife wants another child in the next year or two. Oh I also am going to start volunteering at a hospital and go to community college so that I can start pre-med prep to try to attend medical school in the next 5 years.

908,[Help]Considering Giving our Shiba away,dogs,t3_a9stdp,3,False,False,a9stdp,
909,[Breeds] Seeking a PTSD service dog,dogs,t3_a9sq1q,8,False,False,a9sq1q," 

I'm seeking a PTSD service dog for my partner, but the dog will be owner-trained (as is the norm in our state) and raised from puppyhood by us instead of being purchased from a service dog organization, so we're kind of ""on our own"" when it comes to figuring out a breed.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, my partner and I have both had many dogs growing up and as adults have successfully raised a Pembroke corgi, who is our pride and joy. We primarily have experience with herding breeds but from what I understand they are not necessarily good PTSD service dogs as they tend to be reactive themselves.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We are definitely going through a reputable breeder so we can properly expose the dog to all situations from a young age. There are no young shelter dogs where we live.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Laid-back, not reactive, not anxious, friendly, easygoing, doesn't require a huge amount of exercise, large to extra large, kind.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* We're thinking a golden retriever is our best bet, but are open to other breeds. My partner has a fondness for GSDs but we feel the exercise requirements are going to be an issue as well as the tendencies toward reactivity.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The dog will be a service dog for my partner with PTSD and will be expected to perform those duties, which will include cueing when my partner is going to have a panic attack, leading him out of the store if he has one, etc.

**Care Commitments**

6. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* We both work from home and already know that our corgi gets many hours of attention each day, so it would be the same with our second dog. He is quite spoiled. :)

1. How  long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of  exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that  include using a dog park?

* We don't want a dog that has high exercise requirements. Our corgi gets a 30 minute walk every day, plus about two hours of more intensive play and training in the backyard (flirt poles, tug of war, fetch, etc.). A dog that needs more exercise than that isn't going to work out for us. Which leads me to greyhounds as a possibility, but we have cats and I'm not sure I'm comfortable having a greyhound around cats (especially cats that are allowed in the backyard, where there's plenty of ""chasing room"").

1. How  much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming  hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you  be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Daily brushing is a norm here. I'm comfortable with grooming at home but don't want a dog that needs frequent professional grooming. Trims at home are one thing.

**Personal Preferences**

9. What size dog are you looking for?

* Large to extra large.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Our corgi is very quiet so I'd prefer to not have a barker. Shedding is fine. Slobber is fine within reason.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* The dog should be reliable off-leash in case my partner's hands are shaking and he drops the leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please.

1. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or  entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or  visitors?

* Alerting is good, but not a liability if that makes sense.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, definitely not.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression or prey drive towards humans, dogs or cats. Reactivity.

**Lifestyle**

17. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Honestly, almost never, because the dog will be with my partner 99% of the time when we go out.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* We are both dog lovers. I will be assisting with caring for the dog and training. We do not have kids, but will be adopting eventually.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, we have a corgi and two cats.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, eventually, once we adopt.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own a house, no restrictions.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* New England, USA. No restrictions.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers are 70-90F degrees, winters are around 20-30F degrees.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* No additional questions."
