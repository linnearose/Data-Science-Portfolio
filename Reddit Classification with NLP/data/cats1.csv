In the spirit of the season, we want to celebrate with our Reddit family! ☃️

One random kitty will receive a special package filled with Stormy, Bob and Potato’s favorite treats and toys!  🎁  

#[The adorable sponsors](https://imgur.com/a/P16erSL)

They have paw-selected a variety of items from an online retailer and have filled my cart with a lot of fun toys and tasty treats!      
(Can be modified before mailing if any of your little ones have dietary or physical restrictions) 

#**Please read the Q&amp;A below!**

##**How do I enter?**
Just comment below and tell us how you make the holidays special for your pets or show us with a picture! 🐈   
(Parent comments only please so it’ll be easier to determine who enters)  
Deadline - December 3 at 9pm EST 🕘

##**How do you select a winner?**
It will be totally random!    
I will write out entrant’s usernames on  pieces of paper, ball them up and let the cats decide! 😻

##**When will I receive my presents?** 
After the deadline, I will contact the winner via PM and ask for a physical shipping address (Contiguous United States only) and if their cat has any dietary or physical restrictions. I’ll adjust the order accordingly if needed and have it shipped directly to you!  
Shipping usually takes 2 business days.  
(May vary due to the busy season)  
I will provide you with a tracking number as soon as it ships! 📦

If you’ve read this far, thank you! Sorry I made it so windy!  I’m just super excited to gift an amazing person and their bestie with an awesome surprise! 🐾

229,Stray or not?,cats,t3_a8aimf,4,False,False,a8aimf,"These days we have a cat visiting my place everyday or every second day. She’s prob less than 1 year old, does wear a collar and doesn’t look too bad. 

So at first I just though it’s a baby curious cat with a proper home. I’ve seen her in the neighbourhood a few times, though sometimes she is definitely wandering more than most other cats here (like crossing a big road and wandering around the city center.. so maybe radius of 300m? Most other cats are just wandering around their homes .. ). So that’s kind of unusual, is this a typical stray behaviour? 

Yesterday she visited us again. After giving her some cat snacks (we’ve prepared recently since she’s visiting us) she played in our living room (ok, please have fun). But she didn’t want to leave anymore. Our door is always left open when she’s here to make her feel comfortable, but yesterday she didn’t want to leave. After maybe 30mins, when she finally walked to the door, we shut but for some reason she stayed there for another 15-20mins... 

That was kind of odd and now I’m regretting that she might be a stray who’s looking for a new home and we just kicked her out 😣 

Now I’m not sure what to do if she comes again? Just let her go again/ or make her leave... (I mean she’s wearing a collar, but I’m not sure if something is engraved on it, she attacks my hand when I reach out for her collar). I asked our close neighbors, it’s not their cat.

We currently have an 18 month old male orange tabby named Simba that is very high energy (And sometimes a little destructive/annoying in the early morning) and think a brother or sister may help keep him occupied while we are at work/away from home in general. I’ve read where it’s best to either get a younger cat (so paternal instincts kick in) or one of the same age and energy level so they can keep up with each other. We are first time cat owners and have had Simba for just over a year with no issues at all! (Knock on wood!)

275,Seeking your advice for my cat's new home,cats,t3_a8adms,0,False,False,a8adms,"My girlfriend is moving in with me in a couple of weeks, and she wants to take her cat with her, which I agree with. Thing is, my (rented) home is pretty small (1 bedroom, plus decent living-room, 1 toilet and a normal to small size kitchen), and has almost no natural light or outside space. It's a ground floor flat and we get our natural light from 2 sources: a translucent main door and our bedroom's window.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a cat that loves to go outside. My girlfriend's current flat has a terrace at the top of the building, and the cat loves to sneak and spend hours and hours there, enjoying the sun and having a nice view of the city. None of this things will be available to him from now on.

&amp;#x200B;

The translucent door has two windows on the side, and they can be opened from the top or the side, and the cat could use it to come and go. Outside the translucent door there is a metal barred door with enough space for the cat to leave, but just outside this door, there is a street with cars and multiple threats (nextdoor guy has a menacing-looking dog. There is like 1 metre between both doors. We want to put something in the metal door to prevent him from sneaking out and also threats for him like dogs, possible assholes throwing something at him etc. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

We also would love to be able to take him with us for a walk outside from time to time with some harness or something, but so far, my girlfriend has failed to let the cat put any kind of system on him. We think walks and this metre of outside space should make his life better, but are unsure, especially about walks because how difficult (and also dangerous for him) it is to teach him to like the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any ideas on these topics or just about anything to make him happier when he comes? I'm buying pheromones spray to put on the walls and a heating pad to help him with the change (also Winter is a bit harsher here)"

298,Why was kitten crying to get into room?,cats,t3_a89sat,5,False,False,a89sat,"I live in a small apartment with 2 cats. There's a main room with the kitchen facilities. And there's a single room for activity where I do most of my work. I had my mattress in the activity room so was sleeping in there. And all the cat stuff was in there. I had an area for the cats with their cat bed, towels, boxes, scratching post, food, etc. There was also a spot for their litter.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I got my place cleaned up. I moved my mattress out to the main room. Since I need the space in the activity room for important work. I also moved all the cat stuff into the main room. I setup their bed area and their food. And also put their litter by the bathroom. So there's nothing in the activity room for them.

When I went to bed, I closed the door to the activity room and the bathroom. Then, late at night, the kitten started crying and moaning really loud trying to get into the room. The other cat was fine. She just relaxed in the spot I set up for them.

However, the kitten kept trying to get into the room. I'd call the kitten to come to me. She would come to me, then eventually go back to the door crying to get in. At one point, I held her with me in bed. She then went to lie down at a spot near me. But a bit later, ran back to the door, and started crying again.

After a few more times coming back and forth. I got out of bed, picked her up, and brought her to bed with me. I held her for a bit. Then put her with the other cat. I think this was when she stopped with the crying because I passed out.

I actually slept really well last night. When I woke up, I was thinking it would be 3am because of bad sleeping patterns lately. But to my surprise, it was actually morning. So I was really happy, I slept through the night.

I still don't know why my kitten kept meowing to get in the room. When I moved all of their stuff out. They seem to like it in there. Today, as soon as I went in, they both followed me. And they want to stay with me in the room. Even though all their stuff is out there."

I currently have two adult cats (one male 10 years old, 8 year old female, came together). They both get on and have been in the house for a year now and are fully settled into the house.

We have been approached by a cat rescue that me and my partner previously looked to get cats (our current cats where rescued from a families neighbour who sadly passed away).

They are looking for a good home to two adult cats who have been through a lot. They had been kept in a small caged run for 3 and a half years. The mother is incredibly skittish, the son is just very shy.

Me and my partner are very conflicted on if we should take them, we are happy to have other cats in the house, however we are more concerned about our existing two cats and how they would react. We don't wont to cause undue major stress on them due to their age and want to ensure they could co-exist.

Would this situation work, or is it best to politely decline?

Any and all advice would be very welcome! :) "

I was kind and gentle on him because I like him a lot better clean and not smelling like crap, so he'll get bathed again.

He stayed outside two hours past dinner time and he didn't come in until I called him. When he came in he stayed at arms length for a minute or so while he stared me down. Then he started to purr and he loves me again! He's back to always being on or near me, so I guess he forgives me. Oh, and he smells way better!"

He started vomiting, keeled over, and almost died right there.  He spent the week at our great vet and was able to  come home with permanent medication.  Since then, he's been found to be allergic to chicken among other health issues.  He also needs wet food as dry causes him to choke and vomit it back up.  His prescription food manufacturer changed the recipe recently by adding chicken byproduct.  I found [Core for Cats](https://www.wellnesspetfood.com/natural-cat-food/product-catalog/corer-pate-whitefish-salmon-herring) but he is still losing weight and looking like just skin and bones.  Any ideas on another, completely chicken free wet food that has high fat and/or protein in it would be greatly appreciated.  Perhaps high fat treats or food additives?  He's been my boy since i found him as a little baby abandoned in a box in an empty parking lot.  I can't imagine losing his by just withering away.

507,Advice on feeding while away,cats,t3_a84huu,7,False,False,a84huu,"Edit/Update: I called my vet this morning and they were happy to let me board him over Christmas. Phew! I can enjoy my holiday now. 

Last night my husband and I found a kitten who had been dumped out at a strip mall and brought him home. Husband took him to the vet today: four months old, tested negative for everything except roundworm. Got him vaccinated and treated and we have set up our guest room as his personal space to keep him away from our other pets so he can get settled and we can watch for any other contagious illness that may infect the other cat. Cool. I feel like a decent kitten mom. 

Here is my issue: Christmas is next week and we will be out of town Sunday night through Tuesday afternoon. My parents and in laws have cats and don’t have the space needed to isolate him; I don’t want to bring him with us since he may develop an illness and infect them; this is also a three hour car ride and I don’t want to stress him out. There is a boarding facility close by, but I don’t know if they will have any spaces available during Christmas Eve and Christmas, or if they will take a kitten who is recovering from parasites. Our current plan is to leave him here in his room with plenty food and water. The problem is he is eating like he’s never had a meal in his life. Every time I fill his bowl it’s gone as soon as he can gobble it down. We can not afford an automated feeder before we leave (Christmas time, just spend ~250 on vetting and supplies); I can spare the money to get one of those gravity feeders, though. 

Has anyone had a similar dilemma with a new cat? Will his eating slow down once his parasites start to resolve and he realizes he isn’t starving? Will he eat to the point of illness with a gravity feeder? Should I leave a portioned amount instead to avoid overeating and hope he doesn’t gobble it all within the first 12 hours?

And please, I would appreciate if you keep any rude comments or “if you were a good cat owner you would stay home with him over Christmas” to yourself. I am going to call the boarding facility tomorrow and hopefully they will take him those days, and my family is just as awful as yours when someone tries to skip a holiday. "

575,I need help making my cats comfortable in our new home.,cats,t3_a83utv,5,False,False,a83utv,"My parents just moved into a new home, they’ve been here for about 2-3 months now so the cats are finally comfortable in my parents bedroom (the door stays closed). But the issue is, that is the only place they’re comfortable.

So I need advice on how to make my cats comfortable in the rest of the house or at the very least my bedroom.

I go to college a couple hours away from home so I can only come home to see my boys on weekends. I would really like to be able to have them in my room and spend time with them when I’m home.

When I bring them into my room my younger cat will walk around the perimeter of the bedroom and smell everything. He will do that for a while and then he will go to my door and meow to be let out and go directly to my parents door and wait to be let in. He is more comfortable with travel, I’ve had him since he was a kitten and he is leash trained, likes to go on car rides and is very brave when we go to new places. 

My other cat just gets scared of being in the room and will want to be let out immediately, if my parents door isn’t open he will run downstairs and hide somewhere (he likes to on top of the fridge). He’s also a sprayer as we got him as an adult and he wasn’t fixed and from my knowledge once a cat starts spraying even if you get them fixed after it doesn’t stop them. He is more sensitive as we got him from a home he was being severely neglected in. 

I’ve started bringing more and more things into my bedroom that are from the old house, things that smell like me, etc to make them comfortable but it doesn’t seem to be helping much. The only time I successfully brought the older one into my room was when I fed him wet food and he seemed to not care where he was, but I messed that up by trying to bring in the younger one which made the older one run out when I opened the door.

I got both the cats when I was living in a home I had lived in for a couple years, with the older cat being adopted first. They had no trouble adjusting to that house, or each other for that matter, but it definitely was smaller and less intimidating. This house is two stories and still quite empty.
I know it’s hard enough for them to be without me for so long and I feel even worse that when I come home I can’t even spend much time with them.

It’s been really hard for me to only see my cats for short times and I know it’s not good for them either because they don’t understand why I’m not with them longer. I want to eventually bring them with me to where I go to school but obviously I’m not going to do that to them if I can’t even help them adjust to my bedroom in their current home.

Any tips, tricks or advice would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you so much.

I took a sample in today to rule out parasites but they said it’s unlikely. They’re having me try an attractant litter by are baffled because she pees in all the boxes just fine and covers it up.

No matter how much I feed him he always wants more. I feed him twice a day, half a can of fancy feast wet food and 1/4 cup of dry food. He is  about 7 months old now. The way he has been acting the past few months has made it clear that he would make for an excellent ally cat. Hes always scavenging for food, whether it's going in the dish sink and licking dirty dishes or learning how to open the trash can and having a feast there. We have been trying to battle the problem by ensuring that we put all the dishes in the dishwasher right away,  keeping the counters clean and we even started putting a broom stick against the trash can to prevent him from getting in. We have a pull out trash can, I've been trying to look for a lid for it but can't seem to find any online. We thought about getting another trash can that requires u to step on the level to open it, but then the counter with the pull put trashes would be a waste of space. I've woken up multiple mornings and have found trash all over the kitchen floor. Theon has gained a lot of weight from eating old ramen noodles and lunch meats. He even managed to bring up AN ENTORE LOAF OF BREAD fron the trash can upstairs just to play with it. I'm just so over it and I don't know what the best solution would be. I love this cat to death but this behavior needs to stop. And feeding him more food isn't gonna stop him.

https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/python-scripts/blob/f3314f9048b49e3861aae15bab4af1d2b1b1aa2c/cat.py

Essentially, when you run it it uses the Cat API to open a picture of a cat in a new tab :)

You just need Python, and when you run it it will open up a cat in a new tab.

Hope you enjoy!

I tried spraying orange extract and she will stay away for a while but will always come back later on to chew on it some more. I will come home from work sometimes and there will be small pieces of rug all over the place and strings sticking up. I just bought her a battery operated toy that had a few small ribbons on the end of it, she seemed happy playing with it and batting it with her paw so I left her alone with it for about half an hour. When I came back half of one ribbon was chewed off and the other ones were frayed at the end!!! I also had to take her to the emergency vet one day because she swallowed a piece of string from a toy and it was sticking out of her butt. The vet easily pulled it out and she was okay but the string chewing continues. Why does she do this is? Is she stressed? Is it separation anxiety?  Is there any kind of spray I can put on the rug that will keep her away? 

For clarification she is almost a year and a half and in good health last time I checked. I have another cat and they seem to get along well. I had the other cat first and she seems a bit more dominant. Any advice or info will help. Thanks!"

I have no idea why she's been doing this, as she used to lay in those places often in the evening. She uses the litter box to poop and pee too but I wake up to yellow spots on the pet bed and wet towels on the lazy chair. I have no other pets, she's not declawed, and has been spayed. Is there any solutions to this??

683,"[URGENT] I may have to euthanize my male cat, am I making the right choice?",cats,t3_a7xs45,3,False,False,a7xs45,"Background: I have a male cat that I've had with me for about 3 years; I found him as a kitten alone in a box and didn't want the kitten to die just like that, so I took him in. about a year ago, he suffered an injury that teared of a part of his skin in his front leg, and spending thousands of bucks to heal him, to this day I can't seem to get the open wound to heal and the skin to grow back. The open wound will often get maggot infections, which I have to spend money to clear them out, only for them to get maggots a month or weeks later.

What's worse, he has grown very aggresive towards my other cats, especially males, who he would attack at sight, and he can't seem to stop chasing and harassing the female cats. Thus most of his time spent last year was in a cage. And he also starts to spray all over the place, refusing to pee in the litterbox (despite the fact that he used to pee in the box before with no problems). I neutered him, hoping that neutering would fix these behavioural problems, but there's barely any change if at all; he's still as aggressive and pees all over the place.

I am at my wits' end. I have a very high-maintenance male cat that not only has an open wound that refuses to heal, but is also hyper aggressive to other cats and sprays all over the place, which I am forced to keep in a cage at all times. At this point it feels like I'm just torturing him, and I get the feeling that he no longer sees me as a kind and caring master and more of a cruel torturer. And I honestly cant keep taking care of him like this; he requires so much maintenance and costs too much. He's my favorite cat of all my cats, since he was there with me during my a dark sad period of my life, but at this point I'm seriously contemplating whether or not I should just euthanize him and simply end both of our suffering. Would this be the right decision?"
684,Litter robot. Best litter to use?,cats,t3_a827qj,3,False,False,a827qj,"Hey guys!

It's been about a month since I've had the litter robot and I'm extremely happy with it.

We were using fresh step and it worked perfectly but the litter smells lingered on the cats so if they were in my lap I could still smell the litter. 

I changed to arm and hammer slump deal and it seems like it made everything worse. It clumped but became stuck to the robot so nothing was falling like it should.

I had to clean it completely and then changed it to cats pride. I feel these litters are sticking to the globe and not doing what it should be doing. 

Can anyone suggest a litter that actually works that's not fresh step? I dont know what to do!"

They've both been together since I rescued them off the street (both under 3 weeks old.) It's been about 6 or 7 years of them living together. Coco has pretty severe anxiety, but she's always been fine for the most part while Cinder was nearby, and they've been inseparable.

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 weeks ago, Cinder had to undergo dental surgery to pull a bent tooth. She stayed at the vet overnight. When she came back, Coco has stopped recognizing her. Constant hissing, chasing her around, etc. I've done a lot of research on the topic of feline non-recognition aggression, I've given Cinder a bath, tried to reintroduce her through a barrier, and even separated them. Nothing has worked. Even moreso, Coco is starting to meow a lot more, and she's generally way more attention hungry than what is normal for her. It's like Coco misses Cinder, but can't recognize that they're in the same room.

She was a barn kitten with no history who I took in at around 6-8 weeks. Shes been with me through thick and thin and every nightmare and rough night. 
And my God she has no brains.
I've had her sight checked, I've had vets confirm she is healthy and happy. She is just not the smartest baby out there. 
I bring this up because she often likes to get on the bed while under the blankets. She will shove herself under the edge of the blanket and get up on the bed. She is currently in a loop of getting stuck under them, needing help to get out. Then getting off the bed and doing it again.
My assumption is she wants to play. 
Its 3 in the morning, baby girl. Now is not play time, its sleep time."
766,Advice for noisy cat?,cats,t3_a7x09k,7,False,False,a7x09k,"I’m hoping someone can help me with this! Just a little under a month ago I long term fostered a cat from the RSPCA. She is 13 and has thyroid issues for which she has daily medication. She is on a long term foster as she only has a couple of months left in her... allegedly. 

Me and my husband went away for 4 days around 2 weeks ago and she is taking her revenge out on my sleep! I live in a two bedroom flat to which she is allowed every apart from the bedroom at night, and she regularly is waking me up (and possible neighbours) at random times in the early morning. I have tried ignoring her but she claws relentlessly at our carpet and door until she is let in. She has a million toys of which two she will play with for a maximum of 2 minutes before she is bored. She has beds and a scratch post and everything you could possibly imagine but this won’t keep her occupied during the night.

I recently got the calming cat diffuser plug in thing (can’t think of the name for the life of me) and it seemed like that helped but she woke me at 1am and 5am again this morning. 

I love her to bits and can’t bare the thought of her going back to the shelter for the last couple months of her life. Has anyone got any suggestions? I’m exhausted and my furniture can’t taking any more clawing! 

TL;DR 13 y/o cat with thyroid issues won’t shut up at night. Help please! "

It's extremely affectionate, but has no collar and is covered in burs, leaves, and twigs from the woods. I was smoking a cigar in my garage, door cracked, when out of nowhere, this majestic fluffy black stray hopped into my lap and started purring up a storm, rubbing all over me.

That was the last straw for my weak heartstrings, so I put down a makeshift bed from towels and left the garage door cracked open. I've got no problem with it hanging around, and since it's so damn cuddly, I feel bad leaving it to fend off the elements.

All that said, we already have cats that were here first and take priority. In the past when we petted it, we'd shuck off our clothes in our laundry room ""airlock,"" wash our hands, and shower. My question for y'all is whether it's necessary to have a CDC level sanitation policy when our indoor cats are up to speed on vaccines. I would be perfectly fine letting the long hair panther crash in our garage, but I don't want to expose my cats to dangerous diseases.

Questions inside (with pictures of the kitties)",cats,t3_a7sr8z,3,False,False,a7sr8z,"Hey all! So, yesterday I had my cats get their regular senior checkup. Both had something I want to ask about, so I'll do it separately.

**First, Rudy** (15 years old). At his last checkup, had elevated thyroid levels, but we were watching to see how things went. Yesterday's blood draw did reveal that he has hyperthyroidism. Before I go any further -- he IS going to get treated, and cost isn't an object for this (I have the money to take care of this easily). I'm just trying to figure out the optimal course of care for my old man. I was presented with two options:

1)  Radioactive iodine treatment at the local university. In talking to the vet, and in doing my own research, it sounds like this has a very high cure rate (~95%) with very few if any side effects. People generally skip this option due to cost, but it seems to be the best option. The downside was given in that this is a permanent solution -- if we go with this and his hyperthyroidism was masking kidney issues, we can't dial it back or anything like that.

2) Methimazole transdermal gel twice a day for the rest of his life + regular blood workups. The blood workups would happen every 6 months or so anyways because of his age, but I'm not sure if trying to do the gel twice a day in his ears would be stressful for him. There are also possible side effects here that arent present with the iodine treatment. Additionally, this is not permanent.

Given this, I initially was leaning towards the methimazole to see if it helps for a month or two and gauge where his kidneys stand without the hyperthyroidism in the way. But given his age and the fact that he's already lost some weight as a result, I'm wondering if I'm better going with the more likely success rate right from the start.

**Now, Molly** (11 years old). Molly has always been quite anxious with the vet -- she will scream and fight. Last time, they were able to restrain her enough to get her blood draw, but this time, as they were in the process of getting her nails clipped, they also listened to her heart and heard a possible arrhythmia . She HAD been rather upset at that point, so there's the possibility it is that, but the vet is coming out tomorrow to do some blood work to be sure (they didn't want to push her too much farther yesterday). We're going to give her gabapentin 30 minutes or so before the vet comes out to help her be a little more able to cope with the visit. 

Anyways, does anyone have any experience with this or an idea of what I can expect/what questions I should be asking the vet? I'm going to be making sure my kitties get the absolute best care possible, but I want to make 100% certain I'm their best advocate in this situation too and get them the optimal care.

And now, here's the promised pictures:

After the deadline, I will contact the winner via PM and ask for a physical shipping address (Contiguous United States only) and if their cat has any dietary or physical restrictions. I’ll adjust the order accordingly if needed and have it shipped directly to you!  
Shipping usually takes 2 business days.  
(May vary due to the busy season)  
I will provide you with a tracking number as soon as it ships! 📦

If you’ve read this far, thank you! Sorry I made it so windy!  I’m just super excited to gift an amazing person and their bestie with an awesome surprise! 🐾

If you have any questions, please message me!
