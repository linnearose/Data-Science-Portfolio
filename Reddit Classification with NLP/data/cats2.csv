In the bathroom, she is extremely loving, purrs, kneads, wants to cuddle, everything. But in every other room, she is skiddish, and doesn't like to be pet most of the time.

Her food and litter box are in the bathroom, which I think may be contributing to this behavior. I have tried catnip, treats, and toys in the other rooms in hopes that will make her realize that every room is a good room.

Has anyone else experienced this, or is this a common issue? Thanks in advance for any insight you may have. "

I don't know if this is the best place to ask this question, but maybe fellow Redditors can help me understand my kitty better. My cat, let's call him Cookie in English, is not very snuggly in general. He does like to climb on me and my girlfriend when we sit down or if we lounge on the couch, but usually he prefers to be on his own. I've tried to get him to snuggle with me during night time, but most he will do is sleep on the corner of the bed with me. That is, unless my girlfriend is also in the bed with me. Then Cookie becomes a different cat because suddenly he wants snuffles. Right now he's lying by my feet with his belly up. He would NEVER do that when I was alone in bed. Neither will he climb on me in the middle of the night and fall asleep. His snuggly behavior in bed only comes in when my girlfriend is with me. Is he jealous? Is he more comfortable with her around? He is not very inclined to climb on her or sleep around her either, he stays closer to me, so I don't know what is up with him. Any ideas? "

311,Have an indoor-outdoor cat - what's best option for going on vacation?,cats,t3_aa14jr,4,False,False,aa14jr,"First the background.  This past Spring we found an adult male cat in our backyard repeatedly, and he was skittish but clearly not feral.  Next thing you know, we're feeding him occasionally and leaving out water.  Then he expects us to feed him on a regular basis.  Then he expects daily time in our laps (still outside) and belly rubs and brushing.  Then he started expecting to hang out in our back room facing the backyard in the evenings.  We haven't let him into the rest of the house because my wife is very allergic.  We now have an outside cat house with a heating pad.  We're in the Bay Area so it can get cold at night but not freezing.

We finally took him to the vet for vaccinations and they confirmed he was fixed, and he was chipped.  We contacted the old owner, who confirmed that they lost him a year before we found him when they moved to a new house and he got lost outside.  We still don't know how he made it the 1.5 miles from their house to our house.  Anyway, the prior owner couldn't take him back so he's ours now.  Edit: also the old owner informed us that they adopted him from a shelter at a year old and he was originally found on the side of the freeway, and when they had him he always weirdly skittish too.

He's still a very skittish cat.  Super affectionate to us, but he panics and runs away when hears other voices, and he's super wary of any unexpected sounds.  He goes through life with his ears mostly in that flattened, scared-alert position, poor thing!  He doesn't have a fighting bone in his body - never even come close to scratching or biting us, and he's basically a big chicken.  When other stray cats wander into our backyard he doesn't have any instinct to chase them away.

When he's in our back room, he's never used the litter box we've laid out for him, instead he meows until we let him outside and he goes and does his own thing for anywhere from 10 minutes to hours.  But when we wake up at 7am there he is waiting at our back door to be fed and get some cuddles.  A few times we've left him in that back room overnight when big rainstorms were coming, but by 3-4AM he's always meowing to be let out.

Anyway, with that long introduction out of the way, we are kind of at a loss on what to do when we go out of town.  If its for a couple of days or a few days, its not a big deal.  We have an electronic feeder we can put outside to feed him once or twice a day.  But what do we do when we want to go away for 10+ days?  I'm leaning towards a cat hotel, but my wife thinks it would be cruel to pen him up like that when he's used to the outdoors.  She's leaning towards leaving him outside but finding someone (either friend, family, or TaskRabbit) to come once a day and fill his food bowl and water bowl. 

What is the best solution here?"

She came back with fleas (she's usually an indoor cat), and we treated them the moment we noticed them. She still has them, so today I went and got her a flea collar and tablets.

The last two and a half days, she's been acting very strange for her, she has been very depressed and lying on the hard coffee table 24/7 (she usually loves the sofa), not really responding to her name, weeing next to the coffee table instead of walking to her box, only came and sat on us twice, not fussed about affection, not really eating (half a bowl) and randomly yowling. 

Her breathing and heartbeat seem fine, she's scratching like crazy. Do fleas affect cats behaviour in this way or is there something else? Thank you so much!"

326,"Advice: My cat is aloof and distant when her brother is home, but super loving and sweet when he is gone. Anyone have an explanation?",cats,t3_a9zrib,2,False,False,a9zrib,"Hi hi. 

So I have a brother and sister pair living together right now, 9 months, going on 10. He's a short haired flame point Siamese mix, she's a long haired tortie who we think has Norwegian Forest cat. Mama was a flame point Ragdoll or long haired Siamese, we aren't sure. And their dads were different. Anyways, my roomie and I both took one and they live together right now. 

Recently, my roomie took her cat down to her parents for about 5 days. My normally reserved kitten was loving and cuddly and super playful, even playing fetch with hair ties, during the entire time he was gone. She was super vocal, purring loudly the second we touched her and chatting a lot. Now that her bro came home, she's back to being distant, quiet and doesn't really purr even if I give her the good pets. 

I am not sure why this change happened. I am not sure if she was lonely and wanted attention, if maybe she gets submissive around her bro or some other cat behavior I am unaware about? They are both fixed, if that helps. He's got about a pound or two on her and we know he gets a bit aggressive during play and we have to break them up.

337,How to make my two cats play together,cats,t3_aa2r3g,1,False,False,aa2r3g,"Hello , I own two cats and I was looking for a bit of advice:

\-Yuri , a 1 year and 6 months old ragdoll cat

\-Rin , a 6 year old cat ( looks the most similar in behaviour/looks to a Thai cat) - not sure since we took her in our house from a stranger who wanted to throw her away

They know each other since 1 year and 2 months ago, they never fought themselves, but they did not get along much either. The first  month Rin mostly avoided Yuri, and whenever she saw her she would hiss at her , specially if we tried to give Rin attention (yes Rin, not the other way lol). Yuri instead was not even scared by her hiss and she would always look at her like calmly. We've tried giving them both as much attention as possible, but with Rin it was pretty hard since in the past she would come daily at us and purr, but since the arrival of the new cat she would try to come but whenever she saw Yuri she would just hiss at us and at Yuri and leave. (And yea Yuri would keep following us around absolutely everywhere...and wanted to know everything was going on through the house)

Rin actually looked quite fine with her (as long as we were not involved). Like if I tried giving Rin a pet on her head, and Yuri would come, she would hiss, but otherwise she would be fine with her. She would also try and play with Yuri... (without success tho, since Yuri would be interested more in us instead).

&amp;#x200B;

Things are OKish as they do not fight and at least they get along-ish.. they also eat together and they both are energetic, happy and eager to play. Now my main issue is that our ragdoll Yuri, is very playfull but not with Rin , more with us as she keeps brining toys to us. Now , whenever Rin wants to play, and even tries to engage into play with her (she would roll around , chase , then run to be chased, she's very very cute) Yuri would just ignore her and come at us with toys asking us to play with her ( she's so spooiled xD).

&amp;#x200B;

Any way to try and make them play together or get them even closer together? Anyone else had any similar experiences?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Got two cats , but one of them is more interested in playing with her humans then the other cat , which tries her best to engage in some play activity. Need tips to improve this , if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks , and sorry for the big block of text!"

We adopted two beautiful babies two months ago and i'm working on training them in a few basic things. One of the things i'm trying to do is teach them that when I want them to stay, that they should stay.

I've been doing this by lightly picking them up and putting them in front of me, following by lots of praise and treats. At first they didn't like getting picked up, but they're coming around to it.

The purpose of me putting them through this training is that I want to eventually take them to my cousin's house (out in the country) and for that i'd like to put harnesses on them. I haven't had much luck in holding them while they're sitting. 

I'm trying to be careful about my training because my frustrations made one of my kittens so scared of me i had to give him his own space till he came back around. That took almost a month and he's not 100% back.

Any help/suggestions/tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

on a related note, does anyone have tips on how to help kittens heal after getting neutered? how do i keep them from jumping and playing too much during the initial healing? and does anyone have tips on how to travel with cats in a way that minimizes the stress on them, as it will be a long car ride and i dont think they have travelled extensively before.

About 3 years ago we brought home a black female that was maybe a year old.  At the time we had an eight year old Maine Coon, and they got along well enough.  Not besties or anything, but they tolerated each other.  Shortly after, we had to put the Maine Coon down due to a tumor in her sinuses.  It was ugly.  Anyway, the black cat has been alone ever since.  I found a very sweet rescue a little while ago, so I brought her home.  That lasted two days.  Our cat would attack the new one constantly, and there was some spraying.  We had to return the new one.  

So the question is what can we do?  As I said, we've always had multiples and I know my wife is dying to have another.  Should we get a new kitten instead of one that's a bit older?  Or are we stuck with the evil one (she doesn't get along too well with me either) until her time is up?   "

Thanks.

They are very close and do almost everything together. Every third day they will groom each other at the same time it's so cute! [Here's a video of them giving each other lickies from the other day!](https://youtu.be/hZZdExEGTZI)  
We live in Australia in a 1 bedroom flat with a long hallway for them to run up and down. They have a huge mega kitty litter box and a mega huge cat tree that's almost as tall as the ceiling and as wide as it is tall. They have loads of toys and we play with them a lot and give them loads of love.

I've been really thinking for the past few months about getting a third cat as I just love them so much and wouldn't mind one that will have sleeps on our lap.  
Don't get me wrong, both our boys are extremely affectionate and loving when they want to be, (especially the black one) but they're not really lap cats.

I've got my eye on a Russian Blue cross and I'm so tempted to get it.   
We would love some feedback and suggestions on if this is a good idea or not.

Our boys are very friendly so there is no doubt they would all get along. It's more about the responsibility/cost, and smell of the litter in the bathroom. (when we go to the bathroom in the morning it smells of really toxic piss even though their litter is very well maintained/cleaned)"

My fianc√©e and I have two cats: one is five, the other ten. They get along very well. I‚Äôve had my cat since he was a kitten, and my fianc√©es cat we‚Äôve had for about two years. 

We‚Äôve left them home alone together before when we go on trips, and they‚Äôve been fine. We used to have someone check on them every other day, but now we pay someone to check on them every day, including time playing with them and sending us pictures. 

Our apartment is in a building with no other units or inhabitants, and it‚Äôs above our landlord‚Äôs office meaning part of the building is occupied during business hours and is also generally monitored and safe, etc. 

The person we use to check on them also watches my boss‚Äôs cats sometimes, and she‚Äôs watched ours before. She knows our expectations and has emergency contact information, etc. 

But here‚Äôs the thing: every time I have to leave them home alone, I get more nervous than the last. In a few days, we‚Äôre going to visit family for about a week. Again, sitter is arranged and will refresh their food/water/litter and play with them for awhile every day, and send us pictures. We now even have a webcam that I can check on my phone to peek into our living room while we‚Äôre gone.

I don‚Äôt really know what kind of advice I‚Äôm looking for. I don‚Äôt know what else I can do to ease my anxiety. Every time I leave them home I feel like I‚Äôm rolling the dice on something terrible happening.

Fellow cat parents, what are your processes for leaving your cats home alone? What do you do to mitigate your own anxiety?

He was good the first few days home (21st) but has been getting 'worse' every day, and by worse I am thinking 'more comfortable'

the main issue is, ill pet him and he will slowly grab my hands and then start biting softly, which is all normal, however it gets out of hand pretty quick. its at the point where when I pull away to leave he swipes at me. Never hisses or growls, or seem pissed, it always seems 'friendly' but it is unwelcome.

at night time I have had to lock him out of my room, he is simple unable to control himself with things moving under the covers, this is when he is at his worst.

I read that play time is important for inside cats, as they need stimulation and are natural hunters. So i decided to go with the 'fishing rod' type toy as it was recommended. he really likes playing with it, which I suppose is good, but it seem to me like the more we do this (2 times a day) the 'worse' he becomes. 

after 'playtime' he is still really worked up and in hunter mode, and will try to hide around corners and pounce and swipe. he will continue this behavior right up until bed time. I am curious whether this style of play is actually enforcing his hunter instincts rather than satisfying them.

I thought I could handle having a cat, but it is quite a bit more than I expected."

We got two new kittens (siblings) about two months ago. Both had diarrhoea for a couple of weeks on arrival, but the other one (male) mostly stopped after that. The female one still consistently has diarrhoea and often goes outside of the litter box, sometimes several times within a few minutes.

We've had faecal tests done and they came up positive for giardia the first time which we treated and then something else the second time which we treated *all* the cats with antibiotics for as it's supposed to be very infectious. Stress *may* be an issue as we've had noisy builders here, but that ended a week ago.

Other than the diarrhoea, going outside the litterbox and weighing less than expected (but not underweight), there's no obvious symptoms. She eats well enough and while she spends more time resting than her brother, she plays well too.

Giving them 'sensitive' food we noticed did increase the amount she eats, but no other changes than that.

Any advice or ideas?"

She will usually always use the pads to pee, but will always poop on the floor, missing the pad and the litter boxes.  Is there a underlying reason for this?"

I've decided to rescue a cat. It'll be my first cat owning all on my own. Last one I cohabitated with was with an ex, and she took care of 99% of the little guy. So I'm starting off at basically zero when it comes to cats.

I've taken care of rabbits, so I understand animal care, but a cat will be a roamer and I'm a tad nervous. I've never adopted a cat, so I'm expecting to get him home. All his stuff setup, and when I sit down and open the carrier he's going to run out and hide somewhere. 

I live in a hangar in Alaska. Its 48X52. Has a Cessna, couple motorcycles. RV. Bedroom. Kitchen. Bathroom. Plus decades worth of collected crap from my fathers flight school. 

Is there any advice you can give to a first time cat owner in this kind of situation? The bedroom stays warm at night, but only if I keep the door closed. Otherwise The place gets down to about 45-50 degrees at night. During the day/when it's occupied It gets up to 65 ish with the heater on. 

Hangar cats are common around my airport, but I am completely ignorant on having a feline at all, let alone one in a unique living situation. 

Any and all advice would be great!

Thanks!"

634,How to Get 3 Month Old Kitten to Stop Peeing on Everything?,cats,t3_a9vonq,9,False,False,a9vonq,"I have a 3 month old cat that I adopted about two weeks ago. He has been great and happy and began using his litter box in the first few days. Recently he has been peeing on everything, though. Never ever pooping, just peeing.

&amp;#x200B;

It bothers me because he knows how to use his litterbox, he pees in there sometimes, too. But once every 1-2  days he'll pee on something - I've had to remove my couch and a chair from my room because he kept peeing on the cushions, and I have to wash my bed sheets because he pees on those too.

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost always in front of me - there's only been about 1-2 times where I wasn't present when he did it. I always catch him in the act, pick him up and put him in his litter box. By the way, he has two of those because I read that that may help.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't have any UTI's - the vet's advice was to put him in my bathroom when I'm not there so that he'll get more used to using his litter? I've been doing this but he's still been peeing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why he does it or how to stop this behavior. I really, really don't want to have to rehome him. Help!!

EDIT: Forgot to mention that he is indeed neutered "

I had him for two years. He was the best possible cat I could have asked for. I noticed he began to eat less in the past few months, but I figured he was just old. On Friday, I got a blood test. On Sunday, I found out he was suffering from end stage kidney failure. His numbers were off the charts. However, he was still so affectionate, although he spent more time on his own and didn't eat. The past few days he wouldn't really eat at all. He had lost a lot of weight. 

We made the difficult decision to euthanize him on Christmas Eve. I didn't want him to suffer or starve to death, even though he was so happy being with us. But based off of his sweet personality, I'm feeling like I made the wrong decision, and I don't know how to cope with it. 

He was combative to being sedated so they had to take him away to adjust his catheter and administer the sedative in a separate room. I may regret this the most. I wish I told them no. When they brought him back, he was so sleepy. we were there and held him while he was euthanized. But I don't know if he knew we were there, and I hope he was aware of my kiss on his sweet forehead. 

Did I do the wrong thing? I did this painful act to ease the suffering from my sweet boy so he could pass while still loving and not completely bedridden. I'm so upset with myself and I hope he knows how much I loved him.

I watched him go and he seems to try to cover his mess from all angles and scratches inside the box for a really long time.  Like it wakes me up.  

I thought there maybe wasn't enough litter, so I poured in more.  Maybe he doesn't like the litter?  I've gone through 6 types.  I purchased a mat to go at the opening (hooded box) and it becomes engulfed in litter, even sometimes flung off to the side.   

I clean the box every day, sometimes twice.  

I have never owned a cat of my very own before, but had 2 in my home during H.S and always seem to find roommates that own cats.   My current roommate has a cat.   

 Her cat has now taken to using my cat's litter box and does the same thing!!

My cat is also now only eating her cat's food, even though we buy the exact same brand and flavor.   So these goofballs eat in one room from the same dish, then do their business in mine.   smh.  

Anyway, is there a way I can keep more litter IN the litterbox?

719,Why having a family cat annoys me: I need to vent.,cats,t3_a9ol3j,8,False,False,a9ol3j,"We are one mother, sister and a brother (me). My sister wanted cats for a long time. Finally my mother said yes.

I told her not to. I knew my sister wouldn't take up the necessary responsibility. She's a 15 year old know it all. She'd take care of the little baby. She promised.

So cut to me and my mother waiting for my sister in front of the animal shelter. My mother called her for the 5th time and it went straight to mailbox again. 5 Minutes later she gets a message from my sister: *""I am somwhere else. Just show the cats a picture of me.""*

That's right. Show the cats a picture of her. I didn't even care to ask for the logic behind that statement. Whatever.

My mother still wanted to get through with it. Her logic being: *""If we get cats she'll be forced to get more responsible. It'll be a good parenting technique.""*

That's right. Get an unresponsible person cats to make her more responsible. I didn't even care to ask for the logic behind that statement. Whatever.

All we knew is that my sister wanted a little baby cat. Me being the only one who's done research into the subject knew that we should probably get siblings so the two have company when they're alone or lack a playing partner. So we got two adorable black siblings.

For the first month my sister was home a total of 5 days. The rest conisted of me putting everything else on the backburner to slowly introduce the kittens to our entire house and make them feel safe. I picked out the cat litter and the food. I scheduled meal times and made sure to play with them twice a day for atleast 15 Minutes.

My mother and sister petted them every once in a while and ghasped at how cute they were.

After 2 months my mother brought up the question of whether we should let the cats freeroam or not. I informed her to all the involved risks and why I'd be against it. I also told her that it was obviously her choice because she's the owner.

To my relief she ended up agreeing.

To my dismay she started to feed the cats 3-4 cans of food a day before they even fully grown. I told her that that's too much food which is why she called me abusive. My sister agreed with her. Her argument being that there's nothing wrong with being a fat cat. They're more snuggly and what's the problem with being fat anyway?

Another battle lost. Whatever. 

Cut to my birthday. Which is today. I don't celebrate but my brother visited today. He's also a cat owner. Him and his wife are what I'd describe as very....I actually don't know the word...nature-esque folks? Like all about nature and stuff you know? I actually admire that. I love them both. They're great people.

They let their cats freeroam. Both of their cats also broke their limbs multiple times. *""But they're happier!""* Right...

Well. They're their cats. But ours are not. Which is why I'm furious right now.

He arrived ten minutes ago and seemed bewondered by the fact that we don't let out cats freeroam. So he took it upon himself to open our door and let them both out.

I couldn't stop him because I was informed of it after the fact. I came downstairs and he simply told me that they'd come back in a few hours anyway.

I just turned around and went back to my room. I hate that I care about these cats because I know that someday something's going to happen to them that could've been prevented. Yet it wasn't. Because the choice wasn't mine.

Sometimes I hate having a family. Sometimes I hate having cats."

731,"Cat admitted to vet with low white blood cell count, vomiting and lethargy - looking for further advice or experience",cats,t3_a9q5k5,2,False,False,a9q5k5,"My cat, a 7 month old Maine Coon, was spayed 8 days ago. She wore the cone throughout the recovery process and showed no sign of illness. However, after we removed the cone (Christmas Eve) she quickly became ill with the following symptoms, in roughly this order:

Lessening interest in food/water - eventually stopped eating and drinking
Chronic vomiting - every 4-6 hours until she was vomiting nothing but bile
Increasingly lethargic and disinterested in toys and interaction.
Increased hiding.
Greasy fur.
We called the emergency vet yesterday morning who advised to check for diarrhoea, blood in the vomit etc. She wasn't suffering from either of these. However a few hours later she was becoming increasingly lethargic so we took her to the vet and she was admitted last night.

Since arriving at the vet she has had a number of blood and swab tests which showed she had a high temperature and a very low white blood cell count. The vets now think she is either fighting an infection or has a bone marrow issue. They said she is stable for now but could become unstable quickly. She has been booked in for a scan of her abdomen to look for infection. She has had all of her vaccinations and is an indoors cat.

They kept asking me if she could have eaten any Christmas decorations etc. I said no, we don't have any up. But suggested they do an Xray to see if she's swallowed something she shouldn't have. There is no sign of infection around the spay wound which has healed nicely.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm asking here - just wondering if there are any vets or students out there could offer any advice. We're pleased we got her to the vet in time rather than waiting any longer, but we are preparing for the worst.

Cat tax: https://i.imgur.com/YRdm44y.jpg

EDIT - The vets suspect FPV. Though she was vaccinated (at least as far as we know, she has the sticker in the medical book). She is receiving fluids and antibiotics in a sealed environment. Any idea what kind of survival rate I can expect?

I'm living at my sister's house temporarily, and her dog has taught my dog that it's okay to have a snack out of the litter boxes. I've been keeping my dog in my room with me most of the time to avoid this, but recently we decided to try moving the litter boxes up onto a table to avoid the problem. We showed them how to get onto the table with a small table as a step--this is how they access their food, so it didn't seem like it would be too much of a learning curve. We did remove the domes from the boxes, and now I'm wondering if maybe that was a mistake (update: they used the un-domed boxes once I put them back on the floor). Whatever the reason, at least one of the cats is having an issue with the decision because he pooped on my couch last night (he's already peed on it twice before in the past several months). I'm pretty sure it's her obese orange cat, who's a huge dick. Hopefully they haven't left any other surprises around the house, but the place is a mess, so it's very possible.

For now, I moved the boxes back onto the floor, but I feel so defeated and helpless. Normally, my (much older) sister would be here to help me figure this out, but she's in the hospital recovering from surgery to remove a very unexpected cancerous tumor, leaving me to run her disasterously messy house and take care of her foster daughter and four animals, and I feel so overwhelmed. Any advice would be a lifesaver.

793,Our youngest cat attacked our older cat. Need advice and help on what to do?,cats,t3_a9qxm2,5,False,False,a9qxm2,"So on Saturday night(12/22) we received a messaged from my wife's sister saying that Lordi(The younger boy cat) had attacked Peppers(The older boy cat). Peppers is declawed(Previous owners) and Lordi isn't so it's a bit harder for Peppers to fight him off. My wife and I had left that night to cat sit our friends cat. They have always had scuffles and Lordi has a habit of biting Peppers on the back but it has never been this bad. 

Apparently Lordi attacked Peppers in the middle of the night and wouldn't leave him alone, he chased him around the house until they both ended up under my sister-in-law's bed. The fight got so bad that Peppers peed and pooped underneath the bed and my sister-in-law couldn't get Lordi off Peppers even after trying to spray him with water. She eventually got them separated but we noticed that Lordi would try and attack him whenever people weren't around. The times that they were in the same room we could tell Peppers was really scared and wouldn't want to leave our side while Lordi was around. 

We then proceeded to separate Lordi and Peppers by putting them in different floors of the house. Lordi doesn't seem aggressive toward people or our other cat P(Girl cat slightly older than Lordi). We kept them apart for a day, and then brought them together again after we installed a couple of cat pheromones plug-ins in the house. Lordi was able to be around Peppers and walked up and sniffed him and even slept next to him but eventually he tried to bite him in the back again. 

It is now Wednesday and the last couple of days have been really hard because we don't want Lordi to hurt Peppers but we don't know what to do and how to try and reintroduce them both to each other. Lordi has always been known to cry when im not there and follows me the most since he was my cat. I moved in with my wife 2 years ago but Lordi has been living with my wife and the other two cats for almost 3 years now. 

The question is what do we do now? Lordi is currently staying in the basement with my wife's parents but we want all of them to be together and see if we can do something about Lordi trying to attack Peppers. If anyone in the subreddit can help and give some advice I would really appreciated!

849,Introducing 3month old new kitten to 4month old resident...,cats,t3_a9plrm,4,False,False,a9plrm,"So I'm hoping for some conclusion on this as I feel i'm googling to the point of over googling and meeting way too many variations of answer on this. Can I get a few opinion bits / past experiences to settle. 

I've read to quarantine from anything from 2-14 days!?

I'm in a fairly large 2 bedroom house, but still only 2 bed... Current resident kitty has been with us 2 months now, and through the course of the day pretty much visits all rooms, so she seems unlikely to be too happy to meet a closed door and the smell of another kitten! 

I can rotate them around the rooms to spread scents, and towel swap scents easily enough. 

Bought them all identical bowls/beds/litter trays etc so should be no issue there, the cats got enough toys for 4 cats let alone 2. 

Really my questions after that scene set, is:

How long would you personally quarantine for in this situation?

How so would you test the waters?

If it goes badly back to quarantining? 

Thanks for anything gained, just hoping not to disturb the only child kitten that's had free reign for 2 months!... and make sure new kitten feels welcome, and not locked away!"
