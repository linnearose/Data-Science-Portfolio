Last week we had [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/a5v1ba/data_science_questions_i_never_knew_to_ask_until/) about the lack of resources available online for more operational aspects of data science and there was **a lot** of interest in a tutorial on how to leverage Docker for analytics applications. 

I've gone ahead and written up a tutorial on how to use Flask to deploy models and how to containerize applications with Docker on [my personal site](http://www.makepit.com/production_ds). Hopefully some people will find it useful and will learn a thing or two from it!

I am currently at a state school but would like to transfer to a well-regarded technical institute where tuition will be around the same that is a top 10 CS school and ranks around 50 in the US for mathematics. I will be applying as a transfer student and applying for math with a focus on probability and statistics or applied math which will almost guarantee my chances at getting in, unlike CS which is super competitive. I will be happy as long as I will be eligible to get a job as a data scientist or any other CS job after my bachelors to save up for a master's degree.

BTW, I do have a passion for math which is one of the main motivations to be a data scientist. I practice a lot in my free time to build a solid CS foundation. I currently have work experience as a software developer experience at the school I'm applying to and have many personal projects. 

tldr: Will my resume get trashed if I am a Math major applying for a CS job?

19,Where to learn R (and VBA) as as a new graduate actuary,datascience,t3_a7zxu8,0,False,False,a7zxu8,"Hi Reddit,

I am a ""freshly""graduate in actuarial sciences from Switzerland (graduated almost one year ago). 

I am a bit struggling to find an entry position in the actuarial field, so I started thinking what was wrong with me. Apart from the fact that I am a very shy person and the fact that this does not help me selling myself to employers, I find that I lack good knowledge of programming skills in R and VBA.

&amp;#x200B;

Concerning R, I have very few knowledge. We did not have any courses on R during our master program, but we used it on a few courses. So I thought it would be useful to learn R. So, I looked for some tutorials and courses and I am struggling to find some. I did the R Programming course on Coursera, I managed to pass the course ( Even if the last assignment was very difficult, I had to look for some help on Internet).

But then I have no further ressources to continue learning. Where can I find useful ressources to learn R. I looked on the first subject in /r/datascience , but the only book which might be useful is ""R for Data Science"" ([https://r4ds.had.co.nz/](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) . I thought also subscribing to DataCamp, but the courses look too easy.

So, what are your thoughts on this. And do you have any useful ressources to help me learn programming  in R and also exercise my skills in R .

&amp;#x200B;

Concerning VBA, my programming skills are better. I had a one-semester course on VBA and I did pretty well at the exam. But the question remain the same as for R. How can I extend my knowledge in VBA and where can I exercise my VBA programming skills.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to all and have a nice day.

20,Background confusion for Data science,datascience,t3_a7zcu3,2,False,False,a7zcu3,"Hey guys  

First off, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but I wasn't sure where else. I recently graduated and have been studying different algorithms and how data is handled in the vast world of technology, This has got me really interested in pursuing a masters degree in data science. To provide some background as to why I'm confused, I recently graduated with a degree in computer networks and security, which if you hadn't guessed yet isn't a math-heavy degree. In fact, we didn't have any math at all during our 3 years programme. Despite being proficient in python and currently working on my R, I am worried any University I apply to will reject me on the basis of not having any mathematical background. Should I give up and go for a maybe more relevant degree or take the risk and apply anyways. Thanks for reading"

Recently I have been working on various text classification problems like Movie review sentiment analysis, Emotion detection system, Quora toxic comment detection etc. After working on all these projects what i came to know is that all the above problems are solved using same Deep learning approach(Keras/tensorflow/pytorch) using Word Embeddings, LSTM, GRU, CNN. Only the text cleaning process changes based on data. After text cleaning same architecture can be used for all the problems. 

1) Only the Name of the project is changing with fancy names but everything behind the scenes is same architecture with minor changes. I would like to know if this is case with text classification problems where is the scope for further development as every one have already developed state of the art architectures.  Even I also see lot of these different Text classification competitions being hosted on Kaggle. How should the approach change based on the problem?

2) What difference has to be there while dealing with different Text classification problems?

31,In what industry do you work and what questions do you answer or problems do you solve?,datascience,t3_a7ni2f,3,False,False,a7ni2f,"After 6 years in the information security business I want to do something with my Msc artificial intelligence. I'm orienting to what companies I'd like to apply and a big part of what makes the company interesting is the work obviously. I thought it would be cool to see what kind of questions you typically answer in your industry. For example, using data science for detective work sounds more exciting to me than optimizing the price of a retail product. 

So to kick off: I work for a bank in information security. Even though I currently don't work as a data scientist, I did a few projects for them and know some of the topics.

1. **Fraud detection**  \- The obvious one I suppose. Profiling payment behaviour of our customers and detecting anomalities. I like this one because small improvements can make have significant financial results and there are many different sensors/inputs available. From payment history to device registration and behavioural biometrics.
2. **phishing detection** \- Where the previous topic aims to block fraudulent transactions, this topic tries to prevent them. For example, the company receives emails with phishing links. Can we recognize it as a phising mail. For example following the link in the mail and determining whether it tries to imitate our company website
3. **Security Operations Center** \- Recognizing ddos attacks and blocking them effectively and this area also involves malware prevention. Can we distinguish usage patterns that are out of the ordinary
4. **Automatic data classifcation** \- based on the text in a document, try to determine the class of the document or assign security attributes to it (e.g. sensitive, contains customer data, etc)
5. **Role assignments** \- Access rights are managed via roles at our company. Here we aim to determine if certain employees have more roles than they should have and initiate the discussion to revoke them

Other things I've seen at our company is predicting big life events that would interest the customer in certain products and predicting workloads to optimize IT infrastructure."

I want to go through a book while traveling in a cab (around 3 hours a day). I find it too straining for my eyes to look into a mobile screen while traveling.

Background-
I have around 8 years of experience as a Java developer and have quickly gone through python tutorials and onlinestatsbook for little knowledge in python and stats.

I have also done A to Z ML course on Udemy and have made a Kaggle script for the Titanic problem with a few thousand views.

Thanks.

However, these seem a little bit work-aroundy so I thought I would reach out to the community to crowd source some more suitable ideas. Perhaps others are in a similar situation?

**Some more details**

 \- Basically we have a bunch of initiatives (\~100) that are flagged with a RAG rating 

 \- Each initiative is championed by somebody different within the company and the status will need to be updated monthly with commentary

 \- My manager wants each initiative to be able to be updated with action items with alerts for each action item to be sent out to the relevant people

I have recently build [a smart power meter](https://www.reddit.com/r/esp8266/comments/9tjnll/using_an_esp8266_to_read_old_ferraris_energy_meter/) using a small microcontroller. This (apart from showing some data on a homepage) records a timestamp in a database every time 13.3Wh are consumed. By now, I have about 1.5 months worth of data. 

Since I also currently learn about data science at university, I thought I could do a fun project with this data. However, I am lacking ideas what to do with it. So far, I have only classified stuff using decision trees, logistic regression and multilayer perceptrons (using scikit-learn). Since I only have one property here, the timestamps, there is nothing to classify, so I guess I should build something that maybe predicts power usage in the future? Maybe train a neural network that can predict how much power I will use today? 

Can anyone give me a hint on a nice book/tutorial/website for predictions (preferably using scikit since I have already worked with it). Does anyone have any other suggestions on what to do with the data? I can probably provide the data too if anyone else is interested in experimenting with it, although there are probably better data sets around for that."

62,Are you missing the boat on data science? Leverage the Past,datascience,t3_a78boa,0,False,False,a78boa,"I am one of many mid-career people transitioning to data science after spending less than ten years working as a general manager. It's definitely not for the money. Working as a Jr. Data Scientist, Data Engineer, or Machine Learning Engineer would be a pay cut at this point (except for those unicorns in Silicon Valley and New York.)

&amp;#x200B;

What I am doing that proves the most rewarding is adding technical skills to my portfolio. With automation improvements allowing non-data scientists to work with data increasing, specialization will be essential for job security. ""True"" Data Scientists aren't born out of MS programs with 0-2 years experience (after mine, I felt equipped to work as a ""True"" Data Analyst on an Analytics Team or within an Analytics Department). ""True"" Data Scientists (in my opinion and through observation) are grown (internally) or sourced from academia or are ex-academics who lost hope after living destitute while earning their education but somehow took a few more courses in data science and leveraged related experience from a completely different industry.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is hope for those career transitioning people; one thing people often do, and shouldn't do, is mistakenly overlook their past experiences in their industry (that they may love or hate) after completing their data science education. After my program, I went back to the same industry. No new industry learning curve, you no longer have to take a pay cut earning $20K-$40K less than your previous career, now you are in a more senior role (e.g., Director, Chief, Senior Manager, VP, President) responsible for playing an active part in changing how your company solves problems using data. Leverage the skills you have, the industry you know best, whether you like it or not, and focus on optimization, change management, and how your company uses data to solve its problems. You may find that you are the in-house unicorn that the company never knew it wanted or needed.

&amp;#x200B;

You may also be the champion Project Manager (or assume such a role). However, from personal experience, be smart about staying in your current company unless you love it. My last company did offer a lateral move to a new position, a small salary bump, but not much else. I had to switch companies after two years (since they paid for part of my degree) to see an ROI. Changing companies led to a substantial offer - same industry - different title - different company.

&amp;#x200B;

I recommend anyone considering transitioning mid-careers to hold fast, earn your STEM degree (part-time, evening, full-time if you can). The ROI is worth it. You will be turning down offers left and right (within your past industry - in my experience). You can also break into a new sector and still be successful; many in my cohort completely changed their industry (most were 30 or above with 5-10 years experience at the time). The more senior level candidates had the highest offers. We had two recent undergraduate students in the class who accepted more technical roles (e.g. Data Analyst, Product Analyst, and something else). I don't remember, it was part of our employment report and placement statistics package.

Anyway, don't get left behind thinking about your next step. Just jump right into and figure it out along the way."

While the company is very much interested in data science and is pushing towards experimenting with ML, the executives are worried about losing control to be able to ask for any piece of data at any time (everyone always seems to be chasing after the new ""most important"" metric).

It seems there are two possible approaches:

a) count of calls / (last call date - first call date)

b) count of calls / (current date - first call date)


Both of these approaches would bias results depending on the length of time a person was eligible. For example, using (b) above would result in an artificially lower frequency for members who are no longer eligible by adding additional time to the estimate. (a) would artificially increase the estimate by not accounting for eligible time before and after the first and last call dates, respectively.

Method (b) seems reasonable if assuming members are active if in the data, irrespective of the last call date.

78,Ideas of something to compare logistic regression with,datascience,t3_a6zbxv,23,False,False,a6zbxv,"

I'm going to create a logistic regression model as I'm predicting  yes / no
from some data. The size of the dataset is ~700 rows, so it's pretty small. 

There are about 30 variables, mainly categorical, some ordinal, and a couple of
continuous, but I think there were about 4 or 5 that were significant from
chi-squared tests. 

I would like another approach to model with, that I could compare and contrast
with Logistic regression. I'm not sure what to go with though. 

The goal is to have something that makes sense for this data, but not
necessarily something that performs amazingly. My main focus is accessibility
and learning. So I need to be able to understand and explain the model
(accessibility), and I would like to use a model that provides some groundwork
for industry kind of stuff (learning), hopefully.

Something that leverage's reasonably basic linear algebra, statistics, and
calculus is fine. I can programme.

I was thinking about using k-nearest neighbours. As this is meant to be pretty
simple and I think (?) there are techniques and concepts in it that might be
useful for me if I continue to read about further models after this project.
Another was Linear Discriminant Analysis, mainly because I thought it was a
'classic'. There was also decision trees.

Any suggestions are welcome. 

## edit

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 3rd year university student studying Business and Computer Science, and I recently took a relational databases courses where I studied ER models, logical database design and normalization, Relational Algebra, Datalog, SQL, and data warehouses (star vs snowflake schema, apirori algorithm,etc.). I have become very interested in working with data and building data pipelines, the ETL process and hence started to look into data engineering/science. However, I am having a hard time finding a clear distinction between the role of a Data engineer vs a data scientist. Here are a few questions i have:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Who performs the ETL process? the data engineering or the data scientist? (every resource I read gives me a different answer

2) Why is the ETL process so difficult? Does data cleaning really take that much time?

3) What are the main responsibilities of a data engineer besides building data pipeline and ETL? For an established company like Google for example with major data pipelines and an established infrastructure, what does the role of a data engineer look like in such a massive company?

4) Do data engineers perform any data analysis? (I am very interested in the business side of things as well, and I am hoping to put the business knowledge i gain from school into use as well, however I am not very interested in heavy mathematical/statistical models used for things like Machine Learning,  but I am willing to learn if necessary)

5) Can an employee perform both the tasks of a data engineer and data scientist?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, any recommended resources or types of personal projects to practice data engineering and break into the field? I have some experience with web and app development, but I have no idea on how to get started on data engineering and if there are any recommended courses online I can take (on things like Hadoop which I have no idea about) to get a better look on the field.

On a plot of the predictions versus the truth data for the validation set, I noticed that my predictions follow the direction but don't go far enough, i.e., they stay too close to 0. I have two questions  


1) Is there a way to test this observation rigorously (I added constants to the direction of prediction, capped by 1, and the Sharpe Ratio barely changed)

2) Are there ways in the setting of a linear regression to address this problem (i.e., standard feature engineering/regularization that is typically employed to combat this)?

I work as a data scientist in a big company, at senior level. I have a PhD and also a data science fellowship from a prestigious/well known program. I have a bit of background in software engineering too, so can write production quality code.

When I joined this company, most of the basic business processess are broken and the data was just not in the right shape to do any data science or even advanced analytics. Frustrated with the quality of data and lack of it, I helped build data sources that are crucial to the business. This involved me working in small teams developing applications and databases tailored for the business needs. I should say that, the purpose of these applications could not have been replaced by commercially available software. I did a few data science projects on the side but the biggest impact I made was making these business applications. 

Fast forward 2 years, the three products that I have designed and built are showing great value and expected to generate a lot of lost revenue. And we have data of good quality to do data science. Great for the company but not for me, as this meant I have not done data science for 2 years and built a reputation for my other skills. 

Now, I am in a weird place where my title is data science but company values my software engineering skills and I perceive myself as solution/technical architect. 

I am confused on my future progression here. Should I just jump to another company and start fresh ? Should I force my existing company to change my role into what I perceive? Should I ask them to assign me more data science roles? 

I am also a bit concerned about the seniority here. I put 2 years into this and don't want to lose the momentum. Anyone with similar problems?

I don't have the answers to these questions, because I haven't had to deal with them yet, but I can see that they are on the horizon for me:

-How to work with cloud computing/ aws instances:
For example, if I needed to work with lots of data that I can't handle on my local machine, how do I set up a cloud instance to get this going, and is the experience the same as working on a local machine?

-How to get machine learning models built in Python into a production ready product:
For instance, the most common way I see folks doing this is by using the flask library with docker. I've actually never had to do this yet, but it's something on the horizon and there are very few step by step guides out there.

-How to set up a BI environment:
Bored analysts are often relegated to managing the data in some sort of BI platform. What are the best practices here, and what tools are you using? What's the easiest BI platform to use with Python so that I can limit the amount of scripting and transformations done in the BI tool.

-Best practices for documenting data lineage:
For example, when working with a BI platform such as Qlik, Tableu, etc, what are the best practices for documenting data transformations conducted in these tools for any kind of root error tracking in analysis? 

-Best practices for building a proof-of-concept:
For example, if I want to build some sort of deep learning algorithm that can do some crazy shit, what's the best way to build a proof of concept to get buy in from the rest of the team?

I think it would be cool if we could start generating a list of questions, or topics, there aren't given the attention they deserve on common learning platforms such as data camp, dataquest, udemy, Coursera, etc, which all seem to focus primarily on building models and underlying math concepts, but don't really answer some of the challenges you face in a business setting."

The way I've been raised to think is that a 'scientist'  in a field is a person that has or had a significant impact in that field. For example, that person might have introduced a new concept (Lecun's convolutional neural networks, or Goodfellow's GANs), or they may have solved a long standing problem, or simply made some advancements in the field.

I've seen so many people on LinkedIn, towards data science, etc... call themselves data scientists. Most of them barely have any formal training in that field at all, or like me, have a masters in data science or a related field and have been working in the data science industry for a few months/years. What claim do such people (including myself) have to call themselves scientists?

I can triangulate which store is on there way to work by geolocating both address, find the distance between the stores and their various address, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

2017 June. I'm a software engineer with about 5 years experience, a publication in data vis, and a physics/math bachelors who spends a lot of time reading books and studying math, physics, and computer science. I pretty much self taught myself enough programming to make a great income, but spent a lot of time thinking I might be interested in a research role at a company not necessarily working on product and being a slave to release cycles. In my self teaching, I've pretty much went through SICP, Cormen, an Automata Book, ISL, Casella and Berger, and even an analysis of algorithms using combinatorics. I'm not a big fan of R so I learn enough python to get by, but don't deep dive because I already have a healthy full-stack dev job in javascript land where I get paid a ton making web apps that are just wrappers for prediction algorithms. Yet every interview no one would take me seriously in interviews to jump onto a team because of ""lack of experience in the field"". Completely open-ended and ambiguous questions using technologies I don't use in my day to day would hang me up every time. SQL optimization? Some obscure function closure in R? I'd get asked it and drop the ball on an interview. By the way, I also get vetted by software engineers and marketing teams. ""You don't know Google AdWords?"" Mind you these interviews are offering almost $20K less than what I make now, because I don't fall into the ""experienced"" category of job applicants and I'm ""entry level"". So I get an idea, since I'm reading all this stuff and I feel like I know enough to get by:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's do a data science masters!

&amp;#x200B;

My experience is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

A pre-requisite class introductory programming in Java because as a physics/math major with 5 years of experience, granted in javascript, cannot possibly learn how to program. It's super fun to spend $4k to learn a type system in Java that I already know since I've used Haskell. Lovely.

&amp;#x200B;

Second class, masters level algorithms class which is the first actual class in the program Useful, but we're just going over Cormen et. al. Which I already read. Another $4K down the drain. By the way, my employer isn't paying for this so this is my cash. Granted there was some stuff I glanced over in the first reading like bipartite graph algorithms and getting an idea of max flow, but the rest of the class was cut and dry simple. Mind you I'm paying $4k to fill a hole in my knowledge that could be filled with a Medium post.

&amp;#x200B;

Third Class, masters level statistics class. Useful, but we're just going over the stuff in Casella and Berger. A useful but expensive rehash of all the flavors of distributions and hypothesis testing for all of them. Another $4k down the drain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done. My next class would be a review of ISL. Do I need another expensive hand-holding through a book I already read? Shall we discuss confusion matrices and how to construct trees for another $4k? I'm just not doing it. The other set of classes are in databases and optimization. I can read that stuff on my own. There would have been a total of 10 classes at $4K each, so I'm just not setting myself back $40K to apply to jobs that I'll be underqualified for anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've learned:

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I got a job at a business that focuses on being a tool for data scientists so we have then on-staff as well as sell directly to data science teams, where I do full-stack engineering building the product as a software engineer who knows enough stats + data science to build the product. I'm learning that right now data scientist jobs are gatekept, and rightly so, by people who are spending a lot of money on people who are arguably not generating anything on their bottom lines. These stakeholders were already sold on the data-lake ROI that returned nothing, so they're extremely hesitant to invest more in resources in a tech buzz that probably won't actually give them ROI. Keep in mind many of these business don't have any existing resources to get make data scientists productive. It's not alien for data scientists to be hired and they just get pointed to a PostGRES database on AWS, and told ""Here you go."" The standards for getting hired are extremely high in many positions because they simply can't afford a false-positive hire. Keep in mind they don't know what they want anyways, as evidenced by plenty of stories of data scientists who did get jobs but quickly realized they're a one-man show of smoke and mirrors. Companies want to integrate data science into their strategy to remain competitive, but they have no idea what that means for their business. I've learned no to join this rat race. There are plenty of problems for smart people to work on, and data science doesn't need me. 90% of people are using the technologies to detect smiles, and the other 5% credit loan processing, and 5% marketing. I want to do none of these things. I specifically wanted to join a field where I could use more of my mathematics in my day to day, but I'm not willing to sacrifice more cash and an already well founded career for that. As an experienced software developer I make more than an entry level data scientist, whatever that even means since you need a graduate degree to really get your resume looked at. By the way, even with a graduate degree, you better have industry experience or else you'll get bounced by a marketing or finance person in your data science interview, or worse: low-balled.

&amp;#x200B;

In my spare time that I now have since I'm not paying $4k to re-read books I already read, I am developing Ethereum contracts and learning about cryptography. Zero knowledge proofs are now my current interest. I'm also drinking scotch and spending time with my girlfriend on weekends."

I love self-help posts, don't get me wrong. But the majority of these blogs usually make a list of useful resources and provide nearly nothing else aside from a brief description of the course.  A lot of these resource lists are well known or broadly accessible, so this isn't entirely new (or even useful) information anymore.

I enrolled in a well known Canadian university's data science masters program ( I am not going to share the name since it is all my fault). It's geared towards working professionals, so classes are in the evenings. 6 semesters/term program, I am in the 4th one and just about done with the final exams.  Two more semesters left, but last (6th) semester is only half, and is meant for Capstone presentations. So essentially, next semester is the last.   My work is paying 65% of the cost.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was excited at first, but then kind of zoned out and did the minimal work.  The program is not difficult. You can get by if you follow the notes and practice the problems done in class. While it is a Masters program, it is not exactly like a \*real\* Masters degree. Emphasis is on practical problem solving, rather than theory. Many years back in undergrad (Comp Sci), I took one Masters level course, and there a big difference between teaching styles.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it's all my fault for putting in the minimal work. I can barely make heads or tails out of ARIMA, exponential smoothing, PCA, FA, neural networks, etc. At best, I can create linear regression models without having to reference anything.  Since I use Python at work, I can clean up the data pretty easily.

&amp;#x200B;

People at work have been asking me how my degree is going. They think I am learning some futuristic Starwars like science. Some people said this is like graduating with a degree in computer science in 1991, data science is that big (their words, not mine).  I have been finding reasons to avoid people, which is wrecking havoc on already bad social anxiety. These days I start having trouble breathing and swallowing. If I quit my job before 2 years, I would owe them \~$35K, which I don't have.  I am so disappointed in myself. I am going to let everyone down when they find out I can only do linear regression. I put my wife and kids through all of this. They wait for me late till I come home on my class days. Life was so much better  before, now i got this burden on my shoulder.

206,Help with developing a study plan and prepare for future job responsibilities.,datascience,t3_a50ehi,4,False,False,a50ehi,"Hello guys.

I started a new job recently at a small company which tries to give more emphasis in using data. Because they are a small company, with a niche product and a big pie of the market, they chose instead of spending a lot of money to get an experienced employee, to get someone that can grow and learn with them during their ""journey"" in exploring the benefits of using data.

The first stage is to make data about the company's products easily available to everyone at the company. To this effect, I am currently developing several reports in Power BI so that in the future the IT team and me won't have to take time of our responsibilities to provide ad hoc data requests to the other employees. This part is easy enough and is going to be completed in a few months, so no help needed for this.

After that the fun (and hard) part begins where I will have to try to provide my own insights gained from studying/analysing the data and hopefully try to implement ML projects such as  predicting the performance of our users, offer a more personalised product, etc.

As there is no one experienced on this field at the company, basically I am on my own and I can follow whichever route I believe is the best. So it would be really helpful if you could offer me some help on where to start.

First of all, I was asked to research what software I could use. My first idea was to learn Python but I don't know if at least at the beginning, to make things easier and the progress faster, would be better to use an analytics suite like SPSS or SAS or whatever. So any recommendations on that? What do you believe the best place to start would be? As a note, I believe the budget would be something like £10000-£15000 per year at the maximum, at least initially.

Second,where to start learning? I did an MSc recently, not directly relevant to data science, but I took some modules on it and that's why I also decided to get this job. So although I have some experience with machine learning,  doing a small project using SPSS, SAS EG &amp; EG, etc. I am in no way an expert. I guess what software I am going to use would play some importance, for example if I use Python, I will have to learn Python, but in general can you suggest some good books or online courses that you believe is a good place to start for someone already knowing some stuff. I believe something that also offers the chance to implement small scale case studies relevant to real business problems would be very beneficial.

Finally, how do you go about getting insights? For stuff like ML projects such as  predicting the performance of users, although it might be difficult to implement at least it is more or less clear where to start or what you have to do. But when trying to gain insights from data, where do you start? From visualising the data in Power BI I have already found some interesting trends/patterns, but how do I go from there? Do I run descriptive statistics? Try to find correlations between the data? Look for clusters that are not visible by naked eye?

it seems that in the end, what i find most helpful is to run an decision tree model and a quick linear regression to get a general idea for what the main variables are in the dataset, and perhaps which terms might need further exploration from there. often using pca as a step to see what the approximate feature dimension would be underneath cumulative variance of 90, 95% or what would correspond to the quick lm's Rsquared.

i've had very small gains from using the polynomial - basis expansion, but have found that finding key features and then trying to use some logic in order to derive some predictors has done some work. also some gains have been found in creating ratios from variables (like admission rate to predict graduation rate). also some variables that change their 'polarity', creating an indicator at say the 75th percentile - one example i found from the credit rating data set on the number of credit cards for predicting credit rating.

my last question would be, what are your thoughts on using clustering in order to derive a cluster assignment as a variable? seems like you could just use the average distance metric (for cluster assignment on the test dataset) and assume your clusters are fixed, which seems like it would give the right response as your coefficient would be based somewhat off of the cluster's location in fit.

what have been your experiences in feature engineering?

&amp;#x200B;

edit:: the main methods i'm working with right now are kmeans, random forest, gradient boosting, glms (counts, logistic, continuous and restricted continuous responses), and pca (as a dimension reduction tool)

or is there anything that would strike you as bad form using model primitives like lm ( linear model ) or a decision tree as a data exploration technique?"

It contains custom ID numbers, the page on our site that each customer visited, and the date that they visited the page. I'd like to incorporate some this information into our existing model, which predicts the probability that a potential customer makes a purchase. But, for a variety of reasons, I can't build out the existing model to incorporate this data and select features from there. I'm having to do this in a silo. 

So far, I figured out the probability that a customer makes a purchase when a customer visits a particular page versus when they don't. For example, 65% of people who visit our ""about us"" page make a purchase vs 15% of those that don't.

But there are other challenges. First, some pages are visited more than other pages, so I need a way to balance effect size and frequency. And, there is a time consideration as well. For example, the ""order review"" page has a huge effect (75% vs 10%), but it is visited relatively late in the customer's timeline. I need a way of weighting earlier interactions more heavily. 

Any ideas for how to help screen features? I'm just looking to be pointed in a general area.

226,Need tips on how to (ideally) integrate Spark on a local Hadoop cluster,datascience,t3_a4lahn,23,False,False,a4lahn,"Hi.

I am an Engineering student and am currently working on a Big Data project. I am doing the project one of the Computer Labs in my College (5 PCs - 1 Master, 4 Slaves - Ubuntu 18.04 - Hadoop 2.7.7).

For the first part of the project, I successfully configured the Multinode cluster and carried out the required tasks (Analyzing a [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand) using a [K-Nearest Neighbor Alogrithm](https://github.com/vinitS101/knn/blob/master/KnnPokerhand.java) in Java).

For this I used this [blog](http://kishorer747.blogspot.com/2014/10/setting-up-hadoop-241-multi-node.html) as a reference.  (Additionally, if you think this isn't an ideal configuration, I would love to get some tips and feedback so that my Hadoop cluster works better).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I plan to carry out the same analysis but with Spark on the same Hadoop Cluster. I tried to follow this [guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/databases/hadoop/install-configure-run-spark-on-top-of-hadoop-yarn-cluster/) to set it up (Note: I used the appropriate spark version) and it kind of worked. Spark does seem to start but there are numerous errors.

I am a beginner with very basic knowledge in this. It took me about 2-3 weeks to fully understand, configure and run my Hadoop cluster.

I would really appreciate if you could:

1. Help point out the issues with the resources I linked and how can I rectify them.
2. If you have any better tutorials, blogs or guides that I can read/watch and understand this better please share the links.
3. Am I even doing this right? I have had no actual courses on these topics in College and I am just doing this because the field of Big Data, Machine Learning, etc interest me.
4. How does Cloudera,, Hortonworks etc actually work? I have full systems with ubuntu and not VMs and I have been unable to find a guide or blog that could help me setup either of those services for my cluster of 5 Computers. If these are any good, I would really appreciate it if you could explain it a little and/or link some blogs, guides or tutorials I could refer to.

I work for a company that's struggled to expand our user base beyond ""trendy"" neighborhoods in our city. In the few years we've been around we have had somewhat steady user growth in certain neighborhoods with spikes when we got mentioned on a local blog or something. A few months ago our service was mentioned on local TV and we started getting more user registrations, including from parts of the city we've never served before. We have been debating whether this represents ""breaking through"" into the mainstream and gaining in places we would never have before the coverage, or whether the numbers are too small to be meaningful. That is, are these just users that were bound to join given enough time, or is the distribution of users from that period qualitatively different?

My thought initially was: create a rough prediction of how many registrations we'd expect in a zip code if the new users had followed our normal distribution, and compare the expected # of new users to the actual #. This gave some insight on a few neighborhoods where we already had users and gained more. But it does not help at all with neighborhoods where we had zero users, or only had one and gained one (wow, this is 700% of expected growth!)

 I'm currently studying data science and business analytics (MS). I'm progressing along the interview process at Capital One and things are looking good. I hear great things about the company and it's the first solid lead I have for a job out of college (I graduate next May and have been applying nonstop with only a few first-round phone interviews). But, it is a Data Engineer role -- they're willing to put me through CODA so that I can build a full-stack dev skillset beforehand. 


I was wondering, how is the transition from Data Engineer to Data Scientist? Being paid to learn full-stack dev, then being on-boarded into data engineering sounds cool. Ultimately, DS is what really excites me, but it's been tough trying to find an entry-level DS position. Is it practical to follow the Data Engineer path with the intention of pivoting into a Data Scientist role? Or, do you think I should hold out for a junior DS role?"

I'm a front-end web developer who primarily works with JS and D3. Loading a lot of data with D3 and doing array manipulation in the browser is sometimes tedious and intensive, so I'd like to find another way to explore my data and get some quick insights.

I enrolled in a data science course this semester with R, and I've had a lot of trouble. I really struggled with the R syntax, coming from JavaScript. Also, the fact that R has a million libraries (tidyverse, etc) that all have their distinct syntax really threw me off. Also, the instructor didn't spend much time on the fundamentals and was more interested in statistics and applications.

However, I do recognize R for its statistical power to make doing cursory dives into data very easy, as well as visualizing data. But it just wasn't intuitive for me, at all. I'm used to imperative programming styles and R just seemed like a ""run this line and check if it worked"" type of thing. Not at all like JS.

I've read a lot about python and how it is a very good general purpose language, and has some libraries like Pandas which are quickly catching up to the functionality of R.

Is it worth abandoning the effort I've put into R and trying to learn python? I'm not planning to learn more complicated stuff like machine learning as of now, I just want to be able to crunch and clean data. Or should I just go ahead and stick with R, and perhaps find a better resource online?

Unfortunately, I don't have the bandwidth to learn both Python and R at this moment. I'd rather just concentrate on one and learn it really well.

For my project, I sought to answer the question ""how might the combination of an NFL prospect's NFL combine results and college performance statistics be used to linearly model their NFL success?"". For this, my data consisted of prospects from the 2000-2013 NFL combines as well as their combine results, respective college performance statistics, and NFL success defined by a continuous metric known as AV. Because different positions have different college performance statistics (i.e. quarterbacks have passing yards), I broke the data up by position and made separate models for each. The models for each position used AV as the response variable and a combination of college statistics and combine metrics as a these explanatory variables found using backward selection.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I have to include a statistical analysis section in the final paper. For this, I did 4 things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I ran many single variable regressions for each position using AV as the response and the individual combine metrics as the explanatory variable (i.e. for wide receivers there was AV \~ 40 yard dash, AV \~ bench press reps, etc.). Among the regressions I created, I contextualized the results of the ones with significant regressor coefficients.
2. I did the same thing as above, only using the individual college performance statistics as the explanatory variables (i.e. for running backs there was AV \~ rush yards, AV \~ rush touchdowns, etc.).
3. For each position, I made a many regression models by having each combine metric be the single response variable and the explanatory variables being a combination of college performance statistics (i.e. for wide receivers there was 40 yard dash \~ receiving yards + receiving touch downs, 40 yard dash \~ yards per catch, Vertical \~ receiving yards, etc.). I contextualized the results of the significant models. I essentially was looking at if combine results could modeled by college statistics.
4. I finally just used backward selection to create a best multiple regression model for AV for each position with the explanatory variables being a combination of college performance statistics and combine metrics. This is where my question was directly answered. The models were bad, but I just had to reflect on possible reasons why and do residual analysis and whatnot.

The bad thing is, I need to justify why I even bothered doing the first 3 parts of my statistical analysis. I need a purpose, no matter how abstract, for doing what I did because I cannot take it out at this point. My question is, how can I justify each step in relation to my research question/goal or any related subquestion/goal? "

292,Validate Shape of Data Curve,datascience,t3_a3m5ux,4,False,False,a3m5ux,"Hey folks,

I already tried at the MachineLearning community but got no answer, so I try it here as well.

I have a huge set of data curves (several thousands of points per curve  over time). According to few subjective, rather non-quantitive rules,  some of them are fine, others are not. You probably see where this is  going. I want to take a full curve as a feature and label them as 'ok'  and 'not ok' and train my data set in order to predict in the future  whether the curve can be validated or not.

What  is the proper ansatz here? I think a binary classification fits quite  well here, however most of the time I find examples where the features  are not a set of points but single quantities like mean or width. Due to  the wiggly trends of the curves, I would like to avoid to fit a  function to the curves, as this would require a large set of parameters  and the error would be quite large.

Looking forwards for help! :- )

P.S. I tried DTW which is nice to have and under investigation, however, I am looking for ML options, too.

To give a better impression I attached a plot showing two curves of the same kind. One of them is fine, the other is not.

Let's say I'm looking at 3 stock's historical pricing (open and close price) for the past two weeks. Hypothetically I want to know what day I should buy or sell all 3stocks to get the maximum return. I want to buy all 3 stocks at once and sell them at once. Essentially I want to know what would have been the best time of day to buy and the best day to sell to get the maximum return in a date range of two weeks. This should all be based on data as we would be looking at the previous two weeks prices.

I started pulling data and am looking at the percentage difference (of the past two weeks) of one stock if I was to hypothetically buy it one day then sell it stock another, that part is a lot of data but is easy to see what the largest positive percentage difference is which would represent the highest return on investment.

The catch is that I want to buy all three stocks on a day and then sell all of them together on a later day. They MUST all be bought/sold together. I want a program that can look at all the percentage differences of a stock being bought/sold in the past 2 weeks and comparing them to the two other stocks to determine the best day to buy all three stocks and the best time to sell the three stocks that would have the highest percentage of combined return.

Again this would be off all historical pricing so I would have the open/close price of each stock. Anyone understand/know where I should start?? Thanks for reading this far

301,Measurement of Correlation Question,datascience,t3_a3gpqx,5,False,False,a3gpqx,"Hello,

I have a set of car accident data.  Independent variable is ""severity,"" which is indicated by either ""fatal"" or ""non-fatal.""  I wish to calculate an appropriate correlation coefficient, looking at correlation with various factors...

Some of the factors are binary, e.g. was alcohol involved? (Yes/No).  In this case, denoting ""severity"" by 0 or 1, and doing the same thing for the alcohol data, lets me use Pearson's correlation coefficient.  How valid is this?  It gives me a result that makes some sense (- or + depending on whether alcohol causes less/more fatalities, etc..., absolute value gives the strength of the correlation). 

I have another attribute which specifies the ""manoeuver"" that led to the accident.  This is categorical, there are at least 10 different names of manoeuvers.  What is the best way to look for correlation/association between ""severity (fatal vs. non-fatal) and type of manoeuver, in this case?

So why, why, WHY on Earth do I see crap like this:

`iris = sns.load_dataset(""iris"")`

All over the place? Do we need more examples of contrived data? No. We need more examples of cleaning data, manicuring it, and getting it work using the tool.

I never want to see iris again. I never want to see MNIST again. There is such a wealth of free data that can be used that it's just laziness at this point.

Context: Seaborn offers different kinds of regression, but it doesn't work with dates properly. They conveniently ignore this in all documentation and instead offer these examples which don't begin to reflect the type of data you'll actually be analysing.

I don't need a library/package to analyze MNIST or iris. No one does. We need a library with general documentation about ALL data.

As a developer, I would never use these datasets in my examples and Kaggle helps a lot with that (but it's far from the only option). I would use something with some degree of complexity and show how to load it locally (or even with a requests object toward the web, but NEVER an built-in loader from within the source code meant to return crap I learned in school).

1. My secondary use may involve running regressions on the whole data, but I can access a HPC system for that.
1. I also have a couple TBs of other data sitting around, and having another computer to store it would be helpful.

I work for a company that handles a lot of data. I don't need to do much analysis on the data, but my main job is cleaning the data. I spend 90% of my time matching records across two or three large datasets to have one, functional dataset with correct data and no duplicates. I am almost 100% self taught, and I am looking to improve my workflow. The data is stored on a local SQL database (which is then accessed through MS Access), and I have had a huge success in using R to read in data from the  SQL database (using odbc). Once in R, I use dplyr (and accompanying packages such as tidyr) to merge data from multiple sources into one dataset. Then, I generally export it and check it in excel, line by line. This is where I am looking to improve my workflow. I have been teaching myself Python because I've read it can be very useful for cleaning/editing data. I am looking to add it, or switch to using Python alone if it works better. If anyone has good blogs, videos, etc. for this, I would appreciate it!

&amp;#x200B;

My main goals are:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Flag any mismatches. Ex: In data set one, Person A spent $50 on 1-1-2018. In data set B, Person A spent $51 on 1-1-2018. I need something to flag these, so when I combing data set 1 and 2, I have one entry for Person A on 1-1-2018. I have been using anti\_join in dplyr, but I noticed that it will often miss some cases. I'm sure there must be an alternative.

2) I have been using excel to edit and change things because it was easier/faster than working in R. Are there better ways to work in R editing data, or in Python? What has worked for you?

3) Can I write into the SQL database from R or Python? I have been manually changing values within MS Access, but this is extremely time consuming.

331,How do you explain to higher-ups that predictive models of customer behavior are not an exact science?,datascience,t3_a30u4d,14,False,False,a30u4d,"General: In my job we have a lot of consumer data that we use to make logistic regression models (outcome variable: whether the customer will renew with us or not). My company is based on a yearly cycle, and we have different models for different points of the year, and later ones with more information are more accurate. A VP needed an early one a few months back, and I shared the overall percent predicted to return in January (93%), and I also shared the rather unexciting c-statistic/concordance rate (.73), so said to take it with a grain of salt. Now early behavioral indicators are showing that the return rate is going to be closer to 91.5% than the 93% my model estimated.

I'm unsurprised by this variation from the model, because we are predicting human behavior, and a lot of other economic and personal factors that we have no way of measuring play a role in peoples' decisions. However, it seems like VP was expecting this 93% value my model gave, even though I mentioned the poor model stats. He called a meeting for next week and I think I'm expected to explain things. Any tips for explaining that there's really no way, given the data we had available, we could give on-the-nose predictions?

More Detail: The 93% return rate, with the poor concordance, was something I shared actually with my direct supervisor, who (theoretically) should have a decent understanding by now that you cannot bank on these models, especially early in the year without all of the data we would have later. We've had good luck with our ""late-year"" models, and concordance rates around 80-82%, but even those I would take with a grain of salt. The test population we are talking about is small (about 1,300), so we can't really account for someone say, moving away from our area, or getting sick, or any number of reasons they might not stay with us. I thought that when she shared that prediction with the VP, she would have given him the context that we can't rely on these models for *exact* numbers to return, especially since our test pop is so small, a few unexpected people leaving really throw it off. They really should be used for guidelines for identifying specific customers at risk of leaving, not averaging all of the predicted probabilities of returning to get a predicted return rate, which is what we did. Again, I meant it as a guideline with a grain of salt, but I don't think that's how people took it.  


I hope I explained the situation clearly, but please feel free to ask if I can share more detail.

332,Looking for MSc Data Science Thesis Ideas,datascience,t3_a31qua,3,False,False,a31qua,"Hi everyone, long time lurker here. I'm hoping the community can provide some inspiration for a thesis topic I can explore.

I have a background in computer science and applied math. I worked for 2 years as a data scientist and I'm quite comfortable with the following technologies; keras, sklearn, pyspark, hive and aws. 

I'm currently doing a 1-year condensed data science masters program which consists of coursework and a thesis. Starting next year, I will have three months to put put together a proposal and then afterwards 4 months to write the thesis. 

I'm having trouble thinking of the topic for three reasons;

* I can't think of a research question that is small enough in scope that can be feasibly done in short time spans I just gave. 
* Many of the recommended thesis topics are in conjunction with private companies, but truth be told all the proposed thesis topics appear to be glorified data science projects and I can't for the life of me see how I can make them into research topics. 
* If I don't work with a company I would then need use public data, so it also becomes a question of; ""is the data out there for thesis idea x?""

Any feedback is appreciated :)"

Looking for the solution, perhaps you could suggest what direction should I go.

Currently, users use Excel where they search for the customer by the number and then Excel takes all data from the database and does all calculations by displaying data in different charts.

Excel also has different macros that are connect to each other.

In other words, Data is fitted on one page (tables and graphs) and currently this is an Excel/Macros solution.

My question would be if it's possible to make this kind of calculation in another software (probably BI tool) or perhaps in JavaScript, or any other solution?

347,Quality inspection in manufacturing using deep learning based computer vision,datascience,t3_a2v68p,0,False,False,a2v68p,"**Author: Partha Deka** and **Rohit Mittal**

&amp;#x200B;

**Automation in Industrial manufacturing:**

Today’s increased level of automation in manufacturing also demands automation of material quality inspection with little human intervention. The trend is to reach human level accuracy or more in quality inspection with automation. To stay competitive, modern Industrial firms strive to achieve both quantity and quality with automation without compromising one over the other. 

**Deep Learning for Quality inspection:**

To meet industry standards quality inspectors in manufacturing firms inspect product quality usually after the product is manufactured, it’s a time consuming manual effort and a rejected product results in wasted upstream factory capacity, consumables, labor and cost. With the modern trend of Artificial Intelligence, industrial firms are looking to use deep learning based computer vision technology during the production cycle itself to automate material quality inspection. The goal is to minimize human intervention at the same time reach human level accuracy or more as well as optimize factory capacity, labor cost etc. The usage of deep learning is varied, from object detection in self-driving cars to disease detection with medical imaging deep learning has proved to achieve human level accuracy &amp; better. 

**What is deep learning?**

Deep learning is the field of learning deep structured and unstructured representation of data. Deep learning is the growing trend in AI to abstract better results when data is large and complex. Deep learning architecture consists of deep layers of neural networks such as input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Hidden layers are used to understand the complex structures of data. A neural network doesn’t need to be programmed to perform a complex task. Gigabytes to terabytes of data are fed to the neural network architecture to learn on its own. Sample deep neural networks below:



https://i.redd.it/dum6mzj8l5221.png

**Convolution neural Network**:

Convolution neural network is a class of deep neural network commonly applied in image analysis. Convolution layers apply a convolution operation to the input passing the result to the next layer. For example an image of 1000 by 1000 pixels has 1 million features. If the first hidden layer has 1000 neurons, it ends up having 1 billion features after the first hidden layer. With that many features, its difficult to prevent a neural network from overfitting with less data. The computational and memory requirements to train a neural network with a billion features is prohibitive. The convolution operation brings a solution to this problem as it reduces the number of free features, allowing the network to be deeper with fewer features. There are two main advantages of using convolution layers over fully connected layers – parameter sharing and sparsity of connections. 

Convolution neural network look for patterns in an image. The image is convolved with a smaller matrix and and this convolution look for patterns in the image. The first few layers can identify lines / corners / edges etc, and these patterns are passed down into the deeper neural network layers to recognize more complex features. This property of CNNs is really good at identifying objects in images. 

Convolution neural network (aka ConvNet) is nothing but a sequence of layers. Three main types of layers are used to build ConvNet architectures: **Convolutional Layer**, **Pooling Layer**, and **Fully-Connected Layer**. These layers are stacked layers to form a full ConvNet **architecture:**

The below image clarifies the concept of a **convolution layer**:

The below image clarifies the concept of a **pooling layer (Average or Max pooling)**:

Following is one of the original CNN architectures:

Two layers each of Conv (one 3X3 filter), ReLU and Max Pooling (2X2) similar to LENET-5 architecture are applied to the crack image above. It can be seen below that the CNN architecture is focusing on the blocks of crack area and the spread of it throughout the surface:



https://i.redd.it/j6pewkmfl5221.png

**Case Study:**

**To maintain confidentiality of our work we are presenting an abstract use case below:**

**Problem Statement:**

Detecting bad quality material in hardware manufacturing is an error prone &amp; time consuming manual process and results in false positives (detecting a bad one as good one). If a faulty component/part is detected at the end of the production line there is loss in upstream labor, consumables, factory capacity as well as revenue. On the other hand, if an undetected bad part gets into the final product there will be customer impact as well as market reaction. This could potentially lead to irreparable damage to the reputation of the organization.

**Summary**:

We automated defect detection on hardware products using deep learning. During our hardware manufacturing processes there could be damages such scratches / cracks which make our products unusable for the next processes in the production line. Our deep learning application detected defect such as a crack / scratch in milliseconds with human level accuracy and better as well as interpreted the defect area in the image with heat maps.

**Details of our Deep Learning Architecture**:

To describe things better, we are using an example image of a circuit board with an integrated chip on it below:

**Our first approach**: 

We adopted a combination of pure computer vision approach (non-machine learning methods) to extract the region of interest (ROI) from the original image and a pure deep learning approach to detect defects in the ROI. 

**Why ROI extraction before DL**? 

While capturing the images, the camera assembly, lighting etc. was focusing on the whole area of the circuit (example images below). We are only inspecting the chip area for defects and no other areas in the circuit. We found with a few experiments that DL accuracy increased substantially when neural networks focus only on the area of interest rather than the whole area.

Ø First Extract “Region of Interest (ROI)” with Computer Vision (Non-Machine Learning Methods). Here, we go through multiple processes on the image such as gray scaling, transformations such as eroding, dilating, closing the image etc. and eventually curve out the ROI from image based on use case type / product type etc. The basic idea of erosion is just like soil erosion - it erodes away the boundaries of foreground object. Dilating is just opposite of erosion - it increases the size of foreground object. Normally, in cases like noise removal, erosion is followed by dilation. Opening is just another name of erosion followed by dilation. It is useful in removing noise. Closing is reverse of opening, dilation followed by erosion. It is useful in closing small holes inside the foreground objects, or small black points on the object. Gradient transformation is the difference between dilation and erosion of an image. Overall, these steps help in opening up barely visible cracks / scratches in the original image. Refer the figure below :



https://i.redd.it/nj8bgt3ll5221.png

Ø Secondly, detect defects using deep neural networks(deep neural network (CNN)-Based Models) using proven CNN topologies such as Inception Net(aka Google Net), Res Net, Dense Net :



https://i.redd.it/ozahu8sll5221.png

Some other areas where experimentation was necessary to find the optimal architecture

Ø **Data Augmentation**: We have few thousand unique images labelled as defects and few thousand labelled as good ones. Augmentation is critical to avoid over-fitting the training set. We did X random crops and Y rotations (1 original image results in X\*Y augmented images). After augmentation we have X\*Y thousand defective images and X\*Y thousand good images. Referring one of original CNN papers in this context [https://](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)[papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)

Ø **Initialization strategy** for **CNN** topologies: 

We replaced the final connected layer with our own FC layer and sigmoid layer (binary classification) as shown in the figure below: 

 

https://i.redd.it/zr1sgo7nl5221.png

Rather than random initialization of weights in each layer we considered ImageNet initialization for each CNN topology, our DL accuracy have increased substantially when we used ImageNet initialization than random.

Ø **Loss Function** and **Optimizer**: 

· **Cross Entropy loss**: Cross-entropy loss, or log loss, measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Cross-entropy loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. So predicting a probability of .01 when the actual observation label is 1 would be bad and result in a high loss value. A perfect model would have a log loss of 0

· **SGD** and **Nesterov momentum: SGD** or stochastic gradient descent is an iterative method for optimizing a differentiable objective function (loss function), it’s stochastic because it takes random samples from the data to do the gradient descent update. Momentum is a moving average of the gradients, it is used to update the weight of the network and it helps accelerate gradients in the right direction. **Nesterov** is a version of the momentum that is getting popular recently. 

   

https://i.redd.it/rm4s0imol5221.png

**Our Second approach**: 

**Critique to first approach**: While extracting regions of interest, it requires rewriting code whenever there are changes in product types, circuit board type/chip type (in case of our abstract example), camera setups / directions etc. This is not scalable.

**Solution:** We built an end-end two step DL architecture. In the first step, instead of a CV approach we used a DL approach to predict the ROI itself. We manually created a labelled dataset with a bounding box tool &amp; we let train a DL architecture to predict the ROI. One downside of this technique is that the labelled dataset has to be explicit and extensive enough to include all product types etc. (circuit board type/chip type in case of our abstract example) for the deep neural network to generalize well on unseen images. Refer the figures below: 

  

https://i.redd.it/kmvyolmpl5221.png

Ø **CNN ROI generator Loss function:**  

· We initially used a squared distance based loss function as below :

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/cl28vnmql5221.png

After training a Resnet50 model for 20 epochs we achieved the following validation metric (average missed area and IOU) on the validation set :

**Ave. missed area = 8.52 \* 10-3**

**Ave. IOU (intersection over union) = 0.7817**

At least, we want to improve the **IOU**

· We came up with an **Area based loss,** please refer the figure below to get an idea of how we use basic math to calculate the area of intersection between the ground truth and the predicted label. In the loss function, we want to penalize both the missed and the excess area. Ideally, we would want to penalize the missed area more than the excess area:

 

https://i.redd.it/b73qb64wl5221.png

   

 The Loss function above is differentiable so we can do gradient descent optimization on the loss function

Ø **CNN ROI generator Augmentation**: we simply added margins 5% (both left and right) margins during training time and test time on our predicted ROIs:

 

https://i.redd.it/btl8iniyl5221.png

Ø **CNN ROI generator results:**  We used Resnet50 (ImageNet initilization) toplogy and SGD + Nesterov momentum optimizer with penalty term ""lamda missed"" =2  &amp; penalty term ""lamda excess"" =1 in the **area based loss** as described above. After training the Resnet50 model for multiple epochs we want to minimize the avg. missed area and maximize the avg. IOU (Best IOU is ‘1’). After training for 20 epochs we achieved the following on the validation set: 

**Ave. missed area = 3.65 \* 10-3** 

**Ave. IOU (intersection over union) = 0.8577** 

With area based loss and augmentation(described above) we improved  our validation metric on missed area and IOU

**Experiments &amp; Benchmarks**: 

Ø **Experiment**:

Total # of images: Few thousand images

Data split: 80-to-10-to-10 split, using unique images only

Framework used: PyTorch &amp; Tensorflow / Keras

Weights Initialization: Pre-trained on ImageNet 

Optimizer: SGD with learning rate = 0.001, using Nesterov with momentum = 0.9

Loss: Cross entropy

Batch size: 12

Total # of epochs: 24

Image shape: 224x224x3 (except for Inception V3, which requires 299x299x3)

Criterion: Lowest validation loss

&amp;#x200B;

**Benchmarks**:

Our benchmarks with both the approaches are pretty comparable, the results with CV+DL (first) approach are little better off than the DL+DL (second) approach. We believe, our DL+DL could be better if we can create an extensive and explicit labelled bounding box dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

Following a successful completion of training, an inference solution has to be found to complete the whole end to end solution. We used Intel OpenVino software to optimize inference in different types of hardware besides CPU such as FPGA, Intel Movidius etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Inference**: 

**Intel Open Vino**: Based on convolution neural networks (CNN), the Intel Open Vino toolkit extends workloads across Intel hardware and maximizes performance:

\- Enables CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge

\- Supports heterogeneous execution across computer vision accelerators—CPU, GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick, and FPGA—using a common API

\- Speeds time to market via a library of functions and pre-optimized kernels

\- Includes optimized calls for OpenCV and OpenVX\*

Refer the following figures on Open Vino architecture:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/yqofs0lfm5221.png

Two Step Deployment:

\- Step one is to convert the pre-trained model into intermediate representations (IRs) using **Model Optimizer**: 

§ **Produce a valid intermediate representation**: If this main conversion artifact is not valid, the Inference Engine cannot run. The primary responsibility of the Model optimizer is to produce the two files to form the Intermediate Representation.

§ **Produce an optimized intermediate representation:** Pre-trained models contain layers that are important for training, such as the dropout layer. These layers are useless during inference and might increase the inference time. In many cases, these layers can be automatically removed from the resulting Intermediate Representation. However, if a group of layers can be represented as one mathematical operation, and thus as a single layer, the Model Optimizer recognizes such patterns and replaces these layers with one. The result is an Intermediate Representation that has fewer layers than the original model. This decreases the inference time.

The IR is a pair of files that describe the whole model:

.**xml**: Describes the network topology

.**bin**: Contains the weights and biases binary data

\- Step two is to use the **Inference Engine** to read, load, and infer the IR files, using a common API across the CPU, GPU, or VPU hardware

Open Vino documentation: [https://software.intel.com/en-us/inference-trained-models-with-intel-dl-deployment-toolkit-beta-2017r3](https://software.intel.com/en-us/inference-trained-models-with-intel-dl-deployment-toolkit-beta-2017r3)

**Inference Benchmarks on sample Image:**



https://i.redd.it/75dhbp9im5221.png

It is clear that optimizing with software stack is critical to reduce the inference time. We saw 30X to 100X improvement in latency time using OpenVino software optimization. In addition, besides Intel CPU we also experimented with other Intel hardware accelerators such as Intel Movidius and FPGA. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Visualizing CNN with Heat Maps**:

Often deep neural networks are criticized for low interpretability and most deep learning solutions stop at the point when the classification of the labels are done. We wanted to interpret our results, why the CNN architecture labelled an image as good or bad (binary classification for our case study), which area in the image the CNN is focusing most.

Based on this research in MIT [https://](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf)[arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf) , a class activation map in combination with the global max pooling layer has been proposed to localize class specific image regions.

Global average pooling usually acts as a regularizer, preventing overfitting during training. It is established in this research that the advantages of global average pooling layer extend beyond simply acting as a regularizer - little tweaking, the network can retain its remarkable localization ability until the final layer. This tweaking allows identifying easily the discriminative image regions in a single forward pass for a wide variety of tasks, even those that the network was not originally trained for. 

Following is a heat map interpretation using this technique on the “crack on a plain surface” image using Resnet-50 architecture trained on ImageNet.  As we can see, the heat map focusses on the crack area below although the architecture is not trained on such images –

 

https://i.redd.it/624ov14sm5221.png

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary &amp; Conclusion:**

With deep learning based computer vision we achieved human level accuracy and better with both of our approaches – CV+DL and DL+DL (discussed earlier in this blog). Our solution is unique - we not only used deep learning for classification but for interpreting the defect area with heat maps on the image itself.

Human factor cannot be completely dissociated but we can substantial reduce human intervention. An optimal model is always a fine tune between FPR (false positive rate) &amp; FNR (false negative rate) or Precision vs Recall. For our use case, we successfully automated defect detection with a model optimized for low FNR (High Recall). We substantially reduced the human review rate. With our case study we proved that we can automate material inspection with deep learning &amp; reduce human review rate.

I’m looking to plan out what conferences to hit up in 2019. I’ve searched the sub and found some lackluster posts that really don’t give a good breakdown of possible conferences. 

I’m more of a python person myself, so I am interested in targeting python centered conferences (but still open to any general conferences).

I’m in California, so the ones on my list already are ODSC West and a PyData (I think in LA?). 

Trying to figure out one or two out of state conferences to target. SciPy looks pretty cool. PyCon looks interesting but not really targeted to analytics or anything (although I’m sure there would be some content there). 

NIPS looks interesting but also a bit... theory heavy/academic? Not sure I’m totally the right audience. 

Recsys would be my jam but that’s in Europe next year so probably not going to happen.

368,Understanding the Gini/AUC metric as out-of-development performance metric,datascience,t3_a2nl1v,3,False,False,a2nl1v,"Assume we develop a model for a binary classification task that reaches a certain Gini/AUROC estimate on the validation ( or training ) sample, among others. This is an overall good metric, often used for evaluating the ability of the model to separate the samples into, say, goods vs bads.

&amp;#x200B;

Further, assume this model is adequate and  will be used for further collection of new samples with a certain cutoff value. **What should be expected Gini/AUC estimates on the newly collected sample?**

From what I'm noticing, on the training sample there were clear cases where the model was able to distinguish and separate it with large probabilities. On the other hand, with applied cuttoff, say, &lt;50%, the new sample with collect only those cases where no such clear separation is possible (because if it would, the case might not get collected). With such approach, for me it seems logical that the overall separation in the new sample will be lower, resulting in lower out-of-development-period Gini/AUC.

**Is this the expected behaviour in normal production environments? Am I understanding things correctly?**

Note: I understand that there are other simple metrics, such as sensitivity/specificity, hoslem.test and others, allowing for measuring and visualising True/False Positives. However, I have found that Gini/AUC is often a key metric when discussing and comparing classification models."

In Science, normally you make a hypothesis and you could either fail or succeed. It seems odd to me the confidence in which they believe the problem can be solved without any domain experience and without having seen the data. It seems plausible to me that the data we have might not contain what is necessary to come to any conclusion. 

No data has been sent yet, and they have created a plan of attack that involves receiving the data, and then pumping it through 3 different levels of machine learning models. So the output of one model is the input of the next one. 


Can you with one model that takes multiple inputs, output multiple outputs that are both categorical and numeric? 

So for example, if you trained this model, and predict x =(0,a,b,2,1,c) it might output y = (3,s,y,6,5,p). Is this something that is relatively common?

410,Opinions on Industrial Engineering Major,datascience,t3_a1vmy1,7,False,False,a1vmy1,"Hello everyone, I have a quick education question regarding chosing my college major. So far, I have been deciding between statistics and industrial engineering. I am leaning toward IE because so far I have been more impressed with the program/professors at my school than the stats program. At this point,  my career goals are to obtain a transferable skillset that allows me do data analytics in several different industries (specifically disaster planning, fields with geographical data, etc.). 

With that being said, would IE be a good major for these goals? I underdstand that becoming a data scientist will likely require grad school, but I at the moment my focus would be an analyst in several fields. Is IE too focused on process improvement?  I've been told it has a heavy focus on stats and simulation. 

Overall, I think I would enjoy the IE program more, but I don't think I want to work in a manufacturing environment and am curious if IE + self study is enough to end up in a DS related role. Thanks for any insight you all can provide! "
411,Multiple Regression Interview Practical Assessment – How to respond?,datascience,t3_a1x4ee,3,False,False,a1x4ee,"Hi all,

I am applying for a Data Science Intern position at an American firm. I would appreciate some advice in how to go about responding to a practical question provided for me as part of the application process. I have until Monday the 10th of December to get back to them. I'm not looking for answers, just guidance / suggestions.

I was given a large dataset and told to answer the question. The question is of the form, ""Does quality or market value degrade faster in fruit/produce sent to market? You will have to present your findings to a panel of grocery executives."" That isn't the actual question—just similar. I am assuming that the dataset will have relevant information inside, and I am also supposed to provide the queries I use in my response. I asked some follow-up questions—how is quality defined, et cetera? The recruiter's response was that this was up to me, as the ""critical thinking"" part of the assignment, which I'm fine with.

I have primarily a CS background with an emphasis on ML. So, this type of statistical analysis is new to me, but not foreign. The interviewer didn't specify a format for my response. If there is an industry standard, I would love to know about it. What I was thinking of doing was the following process:

1. Define terms and assumptions—what is ""quality "", what is ""market value"", and how do I assess degradation? Is the time scale over individual items or on entire types of fruits (apples vs pears and so on)? I have reasonable freedom with this, I think.
2. I would need to design queries for the relevant data in the particular database language the company uses (I'm using their platform for this assessment). In order to do that, I will need to know the data I am looking for, based on the above.
3. Once I have the data, I have to aggregate it in a way that quantifies the two variables ""quality"" and ""market value"" (the two data points in the example are unlikely to be independent).
4. After that, I need to perform regression of the two variables with respect to my definition of time. I was hoping to get some advice on any multiple regression algorithms you would recommend. For now I'm going to assume that the data will be linearly correlated and go from there.
5. Once I get that correlation, I need to present it somehow. I was thinking a 1 or 2 page infographic would do the trick, because I am submitting the queries I used separately. If you agree that this is a good idea, I would appreciate knowing if there was an existing tool for making infographics that you would recommend.

Thank you for reading this post. I am interested in data science and I am looking to make a good impression, but I know that I have a lot to learn. Any advice is welcome.

Edit: I am most experienced in Python."

415,Prescriptive Maintenance for Manufacturing Industry using Machine Learning,datascience,t3_a1vcfj,0,False,False,a1vcfj,"**Authors: Partha Deka** and **Rohit Mittal**

**Industrial Maintenance:**

Today’s trend of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the increased level of Automation in manufacturing allow firms to flexibly connect assets and improve productivity through data-driven insights that has not been possible before. As more automation is used in manufacturing, the speed of responses required in dealing with maintenance issues is going to get faster and automated decisions as to what’s the best option from an economic standpoint are getting more complex.

**Prescriptive Maintenance:**

Prescriptive Maintenance is a paradigm shift that fosters moving from a strict dependence on planned events to being able to take real-time action from actual events. Prescriptive maintenance leverages advanced software to pattern identification points to explicitly diagnose root cause issues and then indicate precise and timely actions to change the outcome in a timely manner. Industrial firms are using prescriptive maintenance and analytics software to reduce or eliminate unplanned downtime and maximize profitability and equipment reliability. AI-enabled Prescriptive Maintenance is unique in that instead of just predicting impending failure it strives to produce outcome-focused recommendations for operations and maintenance from analytics.

**Driving Up Productivity:**

Productivity is one of the three basic elements that manufacturers are seeking along with cost and quality. Today, there’s an estimated $500 billion worth of machine tools in place to help firms manage their industrial equipment. However, modern firms are looking to go beyond preventive maintenance to enable prescriptive maintenance systems. For example, reduction of downtime is important for industrial equipment and machinery to drive up productivity and overall operational equipment efficiency. The OEE golden standard is only at about 80%. Exceeding these efficiency levels have proven difficult without manual effort or costly process.  

**Digital Core:** 

A key aspect for implementing prescriptive maintenance and analytics is to include next-generation digital core technologies including AI, machine learning, IoT connectivity, collaboration and advanced analytics. These tools must be flexible, scalable, and easily integrated into legacy IT infrastructure. They allow organizations to integrate business process and transactional data from back office systems with massive amounts of structured and unstructured data from various sources. Advanced analytics can then be embedded in the data, on a timely basis, across the digital core enabling the organization to derive new insights, such as predicting outcomes or proposing new actions.

**Simulation and Flexible Modeling:**

Aggregating and ingesting data across a unified digital core is just the first of the requirements to achieve digital transformation. To optimize the outcomes from the transformation the firm needs to be able to collaborate across all areas of its organization. Virtual collaboration is increasingly becoming the standard for developing and maintaining excellence in industrial operational efficiency and increased productivity. There is a need to extend real-time, offline simulation and modeling to all participants in the data value chain including an interactive input capture from the technician feed and up to the reasoning and modeling for process and production managers in order to optimize maintenance decisions for physical objects. Annually, there’s an excess of $75 billion worth of repair done on machine tools. A key aspect of maintaining these tools and systems allows individual modelling of recipes, processes, equipment, metrics and the customer specific syntax of its manufacturing process. These must allow for managing metadata, establishing data manifests that support fast and reliable processing of process and equipment data and injecting data classification and feature extraction to enable AI/ML algorithms. At the heart of Prescriptive maintenance systems is an ability to act and react quickly across the application and device components using advanced software that supports time-aware, synchronized execution for optimization and control of cycle times. Today systems are largely rule based and less flexible for a seamless integration of AI/ML results. Aligning data collection and mapping with machine learning results for actionable insights and completing automated controlled actions in milliseconds has not been possible before. Advanced analytics and control software unifies functionality from embedded systems, autonomous systems and platform integration without losing its industrial grade providing reliability and safety.

**Industrialized AI:** 

Artificial intelligence elements need to be embedded and synchronized on a deterministic basis in the data across the digital core enabling the firm to derive new insights, such as predicting outcomes and automating actions to ensure optimize the outcomes. 

**Advanced Analytics:**

The AI/ML system is the brain of a Prescriptive maintenance platform. ML models for production machines are designed to detect anomalous behavior during production. Training data helps to develop specific models for individual recipe steps or specific equipment types. Timely detections and prescriptions are accomplished by determining, on some continuous basis, whether a data point falls outside these bounds it is flagged as an anomaly and reported. Capability to train a new model and deploy on demand is the key. In doing so, the model is able to learn on and adapt over time

**Virtual Collaboration:**

Visualization of the large volume of data is essential to support managing the analytics and rapid decision-making for continuous monitoring and prescriptive maintenance and analytics. The visualization tool must synthesize multi-dimensional, often fused data and information in order to support assessment, planning and prognosis. The tool needs to be open, dynamic, real-time and available for all participants in order to be capable of collaborating with all participants to access data at various levels of abstraction and network connectivity.

**Case Study**

**To maintain confidentiality of our work we are presenting an abstract use case below:**

**Problem Statement:**

We go through multiple sequential steps for our component manufacturing. Our manufacturing assembly consists of multiple moving parts – most notably motion stages and actuators. One of the most elusive yield issues is intermittent motor failures that randomly occur over time. There is no recognizable consistency in the failure occurrence in terms of time, frequency, components, recipes, etc. They simply occur randomly. It is often too time consuming and negatively impacting our factory throughput to shut down the equipment to iron test out until one can luckily catch live a failure event. On the other hand, if the equipment stays online, it continues to manufacture faulty products intermittently, wasting downstream factory capacity, consumables, labor and high revenue loss. We previously relied on a manual condition-based monitoring solution and a preventive maintenance program that limited our ability to improve yield and productivity. Predictive &amp; Prescriptive Maintenance has been adopted recently in the heavy manufacturing industry. For e.g. Predictive Maintenance of a gas turbine, a Vacuum pump, an aircraft engine etc. These Predictive Maintenance solutions are highly custom in nature based on the machinery and its operation, domain etc. Further, the sensors used for these cases are geared towards large and heavy machines and are tuned for large magnitude speed, accelerations, rotations, inclination. Our manufacturing processes are quite different compared to the processes in the heavy machinery industry. Not only our domain and processes for manufacturing is different but sensor requirement for data acquisition would be different. Motors used in our component manufacturing are small in size and their motions are shorter in range and less sudden in order to handle delicate and small optical components. Off-the-shelf IOT sensors (used in heavy manufacturing industry for motion sensing) currently available are not suitable for our component manufacturing as they are too bulky to mount or not accurate and sensitive enough. For e.g. Movements causing excessive vibrations potentially leading to misalignment of a tiny component may not be detected by Off-the-shelf sensors.

**Our Solution:**

We proposed solution via an extensive solution requirement document detailing technical design specs such as – performance, scalability, modularity, security, high availability, connectivity, flexible application programming interface, CPU/memory / Network /Hard Disk usage specs, interoperability, configurability, reliability, availability, latency, ML / AI algorithms, database performance, visualization, extensibility, sensor requirements.

For e.g.:



https://i.redd.it/roroghcrmi121.png

We partnered with a vendor who have the technical expertise to meet all our solution design specs. Partnering with the vendor we developed a predictive maintenance framework utilizing custom machine Learning techniques, software engineering principles with appropriate sensors chosen based on form factor, power, and communications protocol etc. more accurate for our component manufacturing. Overall, the predictive maintenance framework is able to perform real-time detection, visualization, alert creation as well as recommendations for fixes on different stages of our manufacturing process. This unique system also uses state of the art machine learning techniques and software engineering principles to preemptively and autonomously predict, detect, create alerts and recommend fixes on anomalous vibrations during component manufacturing process. This system alerts the personal and recommend fix estimations before any actual disruption of the manufacturing process occurs. This has enabled predictive and prescriptive scheduled maintenance of our component manufacturing process reducing sudden &amp; unplanned downtime/ disruption &amp; optimizing our factory capacity, consumables, labor and cost. The platform integration of AI/ML, a time-aware runtime system and flexible authoring tool allowed a much better prediction of process and equipment issue and enabled precise maintenance of our equipment assembly avoiding sudden &amp; unplanned downtime / avoiding intermittent faulty manufacturing minimizing revenue loss.

  

**Major benefits we realized:**

Increased yield

Boosted worker productivity 

Reduced unplanned downtime

Optimized profitability

Rapid implementation

Quick scalability

**Overview of ML algorithms:**

**What is Anomaly detection**? **:**

Anomaly detection is about finding patterns (such as outliers, exceptions, peculiarities etc.) that deviate from expected behavior within datasets(s) – therefore it can be similar to noise removal or novelty detection. A pattern detected with anomalies are actually of interest, noise detection can be slightly different, because the sole purpose of noise detection is removing those noise. As with most data science projects, the ultimate goal of anomaly detection is not just an algorithm or working model. Instead, it’s about the value of the insight the anomalies/outliers provide – i.e. for the business money saved from preventing equipment damage. In the manufacturing sector – we want to proactively achieve predictive &amp; prescriptive maintenance using anomaly detection before it actually damage the equipment. This would pre-alert and enable “scheduled maintenance” avoiding sudden downtime which usually leads to heavy revenue loss

**Supervised vs Unsupervised:** 

There are two primary architectures for building anomaly detection systems:

Supervised anomaly detection – which we can use if we have labeled dataset where we know whether or not each data point is normal or not

Unsupervised anomaly detection - where the dataset is unlabeled i.e. whether or not each data point is an anomaly is unreliable or unknown

**Our ML Pipeline:** 

Our state-of-the art ML software framework performs real time sensor data acquisition from sensors strategically placed in various parts of our manufacturing assembly. All in real-time, our software framework performs statistical feature extraction from the acquired sensor signals, derive the principal components, and detects anomalous clusters (data points) using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, performs time series preemptive prediction on the sensor signals along with confidence interval guard bands and detects extreme vibrations. Following is an overview: 

 

https://i.redd.it/pr2d5j3umi121.png

**A Sample Unsupervised Algorithm detecting various clusters:**

Mean Shift clustering aims to discover clusters in a smooth density of data points. It is a centroid based algorithm; it starts by considering each data point as a cluster center. Depending on the bandwidth parameter provided, each data point builds an imaginary sphere of interest. It then updates the centroid of the sphere with the mean of the data points within the sphere, then builds a new sphere of interest around the new mean (the new centroid), then again the update the centroid with the mean of the data points within the area. This process goes on iteratively until it converges meaning until the centroid does not move anymore. This is followed by a filtering post-processing stage to eliminate near-duplicates to form the final set of centroids. The data points in the sphere that converge to the same centroid are considered members of the same cluster

The optimal number of clusters through each technique is achieved by optimizing the Silhouette coefficient. The Silhouette coefficient is calculated using the mean intra-cluster distance (a) and the mean nearest-cluster distance (b) for each sample. The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is (b - a) / max (a, b). To clarify, b is the distance between a sample and the nearest cluster that the sample is not a part of. The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar

Following is a plot where Mean shift clustering detects various vibration stages of one of our manufacturing assembly components:

**Our Software Architecture:**

We have a flexible software architecture providing full capabilities at the edge as well it switches on-demand to a hybrid Edge-cloud based architecture based on data / ML compute needs etc. Our framework also provides a flexible API to update our ML models as needed. Following is our sample high level software architecture with Raspberry pie edge computer. We utilized Open technologies such as MQTT (real-time subscription-based messaging protocol), Influx db (Open source time series database for real-time analytics), and Grafana (for real-time visualizations)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uajjy94xmi121.png

 

Due to various computation limitations from real-time data processing to ML training / prediction, we adopted a flexible software architecture that switches seamlessly to a hybrid form. The Edge-cloud framework continuously archive data into a historical archive database in the cloud in a rolling window, for e.g.- maintaining a week or a month worth of historical data up to the current date in a cloud database, the amount of data to be archived can vary based on the use case. The framework has in place a rule based model health monitoring system that periodically ( as well as on-demand) checks the performance statistics of the ML model - the performance statistics can vary based on but not limited to nature of the use case, nature of ML algorithms etc. If the model performance statistics falls below threshold values (such as f1 score, R squared for supervised learners , Silhouette coefficient for unsupervised learners etc. which can vary based on use case, algorithms etc.), the framework triggers the ML training pipeline (online) and deploy the newly trained model once the threshold criterion are met. Following is our sample hybrid architecture:

 

https://i.redd.it/tcxut890ni121.png

**Prescriptive Maintenance real-time visualization platform:**

We built a state-of-the-art easy to use intelligent monitoring platform for Prescriptive maintenance. An operator can monitor anomalies, drill down to root cause and receive smart recommendations to fix a faulty situation during the manufacturing process in real-time. The ML based smart recommendations are based on anomaly behaviors, sensor locations, sensor data, time of occurrence, equipment types/ properties etc. With this platform, an operator can also effortless visualize &amp; monitor CPU, memory, Network usage etc. on the various manufacturing assembly servers. Our visualization platform also provides look-back options with custom date range. Based on demand and using the look back options the model health monitoring system in-place can direct an anomaly detection algorithm to re-train itself in the cloud with the archived history to better predict the future.

**Summary &amp; Conclusion:**

We developed a Machine learning based end-end scalable, secured, modular, extensible, interoperable, configurable prescriptive maintenance platform. With this platform, we realized substantial improvement on Yield for our component manufacturing processes. We are proactively detecting faults, recommending fixes for our component manufacturing assembly substantially reducing unplanned downtime and factory capacity, consumables, labor and operating cost. The science of anomaly detection is constantly changing. Our flexible ML API offered by our platform enable us to update our anomaly detection algorithms as needed.

Random Forest is a tree-based machine learning method used for classification, regression, and clustering as well. It uses a collection of Trees, where each tree votes on the outcome. In the case of classification, the forest gives the class voted by the maximum number of trees. In the case of regression, the output is the average of the outcomes of all the trees.

Suppose there are twenty different possible predictor variables. If you create a single decision tree, it may have some bias. Alternatively, in Random Forest, you choose a random sample of 4 variables (say) from all variables and build a tree. Repeat this for a number of times, say 10. Now, you have 10 different trees (let’s call a forest) where different variables have been used and created different accuracy level.

Now, these trees give votes to each variable based on the outcomes, this gives a good idea about variable importance and finally gives the value of the predictor variable.

***Classification and Regression***

Each tree is given a sample of the full data set with replacement. A subset of features is used to create the tree to the maximum depth possible. The data points and features are then used to create the respective CART trees.

***Clustering***

The dissimilarity measure between the data points is used to create the distance matrix. PAM (Partitioning Around Medoid) clustering is performed on this distance matrix (using an input on a number of clusters) to create the final clusters."

434,"Many data points per source, only a few ones are actually relevant. How to approach this?",datascience,t3_a1g696,12,False,False,a1g696,"Hey, so I am a junior data scientist working on this project.

Basically I got a whole bunch of acoustic emission data used to monitor the condition of gas tanks. (They increase pressure in tanks and record the audio they produce in order to find cracks, corrosions, etc.)

For many years they have been using a statistical method based on a mix of parameters (Amplitude, Duration, Energy, Amount of time the amp passed a certain threshold, etc..), now they wanna know if there's an improvement to be done using Data Science and Machine Learning methods. But as a junior I feel a bit stumped to tackle this project without any assistence.

What would be a good approach to find out whether a tank is still ""ok"", ""problematic"" or ""severly damaged"", when the current approach is to find ~20-50 significant data points (the sound of cracks for example) in an ocean of ~50,000-300,000 data points of background noise).

The person in charge of the tanks thinks that maybe more than the 20-50 data points can be used to detect the quality of such a tank.

I have the data of around 9000 ""ok"" tanks, 100 ""problematic"" and 20 ""severly damaged"" ones.

Any ideas?

447,"How to combat ""burnt-out"" feelings in data science?",datascience,t3_a17na3,6,False,False,a17na3,"I recently read an article that I can easily relate to:

https://towardsdatascience.com/ds-is-bs-why-data-scientists-are-discouraged-in-their-field-baea605f5fe

Pardon my emotions, but I feel very sad about my developing data science career so far. I am currently creating a data visualization web application without understanding the purpose of the app, the data itself, and the problems associated with the information that I am trying to present. I have taken initiative to ask for understanding from my managers, and they would just say ""it doesn't matter"" or something condescending like ""you won't understand"". I have even tried taking extending the visualizations by implementing my own machine learning insights, only to be faced with having that labeled as a ""waste of time"". I am practically doing front end development using Javascript with the false label ""data scientist"" as my title.

This had me searching for new job openings and creating new opportunities for myself. I have been working on my personal project relating to semantic analysis on TED Talks, but find myself feeling discouraged due to how overwhelming it can be. Questions like ""What if my results are not good enough?"" or ""Is this really important to employers?"" or even, ""What exactly is the purpose of this?"" continually run in my mind, causing me to feel more discouraged in taking steps forward. I have been doing a lot of self-study in natural language processing to prepare myself for some of the challenges faced in this project, and even wrote a rough draft of the ideas that I would like to implement in my analysis, so I have made some progress.

I have also been applying for jobs relating to data science. Of course the majority of the positions rejected me due to lack of experience. Of the few companies that gave me the chance to interview in the final in-person setting, all of them had rejected me due to various reasons. I have a Masters degree in mathematics, and the majority of my analytics experience, (machine learning, Python, SQL, R, etc.) is showcased through small mini-projects (which I am honestly not proud of) done through a data science bootcamp. All of these rejections are contributing to thoughts like ""Maybe, I'm not good enough to be a data scientist"" or ""companies probably want to hire the best of the best in the field"", causing me to feel highly unqualified in any other role that I want to apply for.

I feel really stuck and haven't been getting much sleep due to this, and I am feeling really unhappy. Ever since I was a little boy, I grew up loving mathematics because I enjoyed seeing the parallels between mathematical concepts and real-world occurrences. I have done mathematical competitions, performed well in them, wrote a mathematics academic paper, received an award for my presentation in a national math conference, and continued solving math problems in my free time. I am struggling translating this passion in the data science field because it seems that no matter how hard I try, I fail for various reasons.

Anyone have any further tips on dealing with burn-out? Data science is a really difficult field to get your foot in the door and each passing day feels more discouraging than ever."

All of my input variables are categorical or ordinal. There is a large difference in the number of occurences of a class within a variable.  For example:

Class x2 has ordinal categories A,B,C and D.

70% of the values is A, 29% is C and  B and D together only exists in 1% of the examples.

Looking at the ACF Y PACF values [Here](https://imgur.com/uUfp4a1). Its seems that an Arima (0,1,0)(1,1,1)24 could fit the data.

After such model is applied residual [ACF PACF](https://imgur.com/GDxORrn). seems to be stabilize.

Now here is the question, I am having problem fitting the data at certain critical points as n=19, n=1, n=2 (data is ciclical) where the real value reach high/low peaks and the model seems to not been able to follow with precision.

That is why I tried to apply a Garch model but after looking at the ACF and PACF correlation functions for square residuals (see last picture) the only lag that affects the data is lag #24, isn't that too high?

Another question is, is the (G)arch model the right model to control those error? I am honestly not too sure.

476,Best subreddits to include in a classification model that predicts submission-popularity?,datascience,t3_a0t2x6,1,False,False,a0t2x6,"I am working on a supervised learning project in which I am trying to predict the popularity of Reddit submissions. I can only gather data from a small subset of subreddits, and I am looking for advice on determining how to select the best subreddits to consider for my purpose. I apologize for the long length of this post--I tried to make it concise. 

**Here is a brief overview of the project:** 

I consider a post popular if it achieves a score greater than some threshold by the end of the day. I haven't yet decided upon the exact threshold I want to use, however (I am considering whether to predict viral posts or just generally high-scoring posts, but leaning towards the latter, and ideally a model that has good interpretability). I am tracking submissions from several subreddits in real-time, over the course of about one week. Among other things, I am getting the score of each post every 5 minutes so that I can track score-progression over time, and use some features in my model based on this time-series data. The goal is to predict whether a post will become popular as early as possible. 

The issue I am having is deciding which subreddits would provide the best data for my model. So far, I have approached this problem in a few ways:

1. I got every submission that reached the front page of 
r/all/top over a 100-day period and made a histogram of the subreddits: [Histogram](https://i.imgur.com/6zpYiaD.jpg). While this indicates which subreddits tend to have the highest-scoring posts, my concern is that distribution of scores from the subreddit may also be important. If I was only concerned with posts becoming viral (very high score), this would certainly be helpful, but if I am more concerned with just generally high-scoring posts, then perhaps this is less useful. It is possible that there are other subreddits which do not reach the front page as often, but whose posts have a higher median score, with less skew to their score-distribution. If this is true, I am unsure as to whether looking at these subreddits might yield better data for my model. In other words, my histogram might be showing subreddits that are more about quantity over quality, but because of that quantity, their posts hit the upvote-jackpot more often, whereas other subreddits provide quality over quantity.

2. I also considered simply looking at subreddit subscriber-counts and choosing the top *N* subreddits from this list. 

3. Finally, I considered blending these two options and including only the subreddits that overlap between both lists. 

Neither of these routes completely satisfies me because they are essentially still educated guesses at the moment. I haven't been able to find any sites or existing research that shows the distributions of submission-scores for lots of subreddits, nor am I even sure what type of distribution would best suit my needs. I also realize that different subreddits will have their own unique patterns, but I am hoping that with good feature selection and engineering I can still develop a model with decent predictability and generalizability. If anyone has any insight to offer, whether it's in support of one of the above approaches, or an alternative method, it would be greatly appreciated.

The codes are as follows so far.

    from urllib.request import urlopen as uReq
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup
    my_url = ""https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspxSubmit=ENE&amp;DEPA=0&amp;Order=BESTMATCH&amp;Description=graphics+cards&amp;N=-1&amp;isNodeId=1""
    uClient = uReq(my_url)
    page_html = uClient.read()
    uClient.close()
    page_soup = soup(page_html, ""html.parser"")
    containers = page_soup.findAll(""div"", {""class"":""item-container ""})
    len(containers)
    container = containers[0]

Len(containers) gave correct number of products, which was 36 search results. The author isolated the first element so he could create codes and iteration to extract later on some information such as the brand and name for all the graphics cards.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I got by entering **container.div**

    &lt;div class=""item-badges""&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

 I was hoping to get the html codes enclosed by &lt;div&gt; tags named ""item-info"" class (8th line below), which was also the one shown in the tutorial. I did follow the steps accordingly but I also understand that the web page had been updated since then. Could you let me know where I was wrong? Thank you!

482,"CS undergrad, 5 year data science experience move to ML",datascience,t3_a0jor7,37,False,False,a0jor7,"Hi Folks, long-time lurker first time poster here, so please be gentle. Long post warning!

So here goes, i majored in computer science in my undergrad, got lost into the investment banking world for a bit. Then through a job in a data science consulting company turned back towards cs and data science.  Was with the consulting company for 2 years, and in the past 2 years, i have been part of a gaming company leading their marketing analytics team. I have always been hands-on and hence, i am deeply familiar with machine learning models. Can describe and derive math for some of the models (linear, backprop and some generative models), and write code to demonstrate the inner workings of linear/ensemble/ANN models. At work, i'm able to guide data scientists and analysts to build libraries, models for clustering, classification, and regression. We have built systems that do media buying, or automate sales. So far, i have hands-on experience building time-series models, regression models for various purposes, churn prediction models, customer behavior clustering models. i feel i can code and have been able to cover about 180 questions on Leetcode with about 45% acceptance rate. 

I'm often intimidated by folks who studied machine learning in school, feel like without a formal education i have been missing out on something. I try to fill the gaps, and try to take courses have been through Stanford's CS 229 and going through cs231n (a bit challenging for me).   
  
I feel like i'm making a difference at work. Our models allows for plenty of experimentation and automation for media buying and feature experimentation. Product Managers and marketing managers rely on our models to make decisions. 

My questions are as follows:

1.	Would machine learning teams in FAANG consider my profile for recruitment? If yes, what is the typical level to target - (lead or individual contributor or manager)?


2.	I’m a little worried about my age (34) and think that it might be work against me. Should i be worried?


3.	Do you advice i continue to pursue a management career? although my bosses and reportees like me, i’m not too fond of it. 


4.	Should i consider going back to school and get deeper into machine learning? i feel that the research is exploding and i can’t keep up along with work. 

Edit:

Folks, thank you so much for all your advice. The difference of opinion in the comments is what I have noticed while talking to people in these roles. For ex: people in ML and AI roles essentially recruit PhDs because of the research workload. But, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I like to be a hands on datascience manager, and it seems possible. I sincerely wish things were different and folks are more open to take risks on people who can demonstrate learning and delivery. I also learned that there is a basic requirement in FAANG companies that coding skills are essential, and that is what I’ll focus on. And, learn some basic deep learning for some headroom during interview process. I’ll apply to pure ML roles in startups o get a feel for the role and questions, I’m guessing there is more appetite for risk there. 

Thanks again for all you advice. Really appreciate you all taking the time to respond. "

491,Your thoughts on recruitment practices,datascience,t3_a0o7pk,11,False,False,a0o7pk,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

It seems that no matter how good you are at your current job, if you want to get a new one, then you will need to prepare for technical interviews and challenges. Then you might get lucky and get asked to solve problems you are comfortable with or you might get unlucky and fail. It feels that performing the job and interviewing for one are much further apart than they should be. But this might simply be my view on it, so I'd like to know what you guys think.

&amp;#x200B;

**The full story**

I'm not particularly happy with my work right now and I'm passively looking for another job. With that in mind, I'm having to go through a range of dreadful recruitment tests with limited success.

A bit of relevant background: I'm a data scientist with an MSc degree and 5+ years of international industry experience. I currently work for a company with a substantial number of Glassdoor interview reviews most of which are marked as ""hard"" and I would agree that the recruitment process that I had to go through was intense indeed.

Having said that, I don't think that I'm smarter than the next guy, I just worked really hard at Uni to get good grades and eventually landed a decent job that got me into this industry in the first place. Nonetheless, one would think that since I managed to get through a tough recruitment process, then I should be able to do it again. However, I've already failed a couple of technical tests which I felt were substantially easier than the one I passed to get into my current role. 

As frustrating as it is, I find that most recruitment tests have no relevance to the actual work that you are likely going to be doing if you get the job. Admittedly, some tests are better than others, for examples I've seen case studies that aim to test a broad range of skills, while other tests check pure, abstract mathematics or probability theory -- not something you are likely to do 9-5 every day. I'm sure that I'll get another decent job and I'm sure that I'll need to pass a tech interview/challenge to get there, but I'll need to thoroughly prepare for it first.

I'd be interested to hear what you guys think about recruitment processes in data science. More specifically:

* Are you also struggling or being inconsistent with tests even if you feel that you have what it takes to get the job done?
* Managers out there -- how do you feel about this gap between the actual work and the way you assess candidates? Wouldn't you think that a suitable candidate shouldn't have to prepare for a job interview (you'd expect that they should be doing enough relevant work in their current role)?
* What do you think is the best way to prepare for an interview (bearing in mind that there tends to be a lot of variety in them)? On that note, I can recommend a few resources such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [Interviewing.io](https://Interviewing.io), [InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com), [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/company-preparation/), [CareerCup](https://careercup.com/)

I'm coming to you with a conundrum I've been trying to solve for a couple weeks in my free time and I'm here to beseech the DS gods to see if anyone has any good ideas for how to approach or if something exists already that I'm not aware of that I could beg borrow and steal from. 

**Background:**

I have to be a little vague here, but I run an analytics group that is responsible for identifying fraud or misuse of various systems, as well as testing whether things are working appropriately. 

**Software Used:**

We work mainly in Python &amp; R, with another specialized software used for simple filtering/transformation of data at times. 

**Experience:**

My team and I's experience runs the gauntlet, with Business Analysts, Data Analysts, Software Developers, and Data Scientists. Between us, we usually have the skills required to get what we need doing. 

**Problem:**

One of the things that I have noticed as my group has grown is that no matter what we are testing or building, a lot of the root cause identification process is built around identifying anomalies. This usually falls under three types: an unusual amount of similar transactions, transactions outside of the standard deviation, or a lack of information where there should be some. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been tinkering with the idea of trying to build a program that can take a fist pass at identifying these anomalies and save my team time from building them individually every time. The skeleton structure of the program is below:

* Import/Access the table of information that will be analyzed
* Identify the type of information contained within each column
* Perform a base analysis over the information contained based on the type (standard deviation, mean, etc.)
* Create exception populations for any identified anomalies by column
* Create an output report giving basic information on the fields and any anomaly types identified

My preference would probably be to build this in Python, since I'm most comfortable working within it. I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips on packages that would help, scripts that are already written that do something similar, etc. I'd like to ideally free up some of my teams time from building these repetitive tasks that are similar at their base concepts so that they can do the real work of finding real anomalies. Any help is sincerely appreciated!

Then have another slide where I list a long slew of equations involved in a more complex algorithm just to serve as a visual point of comparison of how much more complex algorithms get. I thought writing out some of the math behind a neural network WITHOUT linear algebra or matrix notation might get the point across. But I'd love to find an example of something like this existing already without having to recreate it. Anyone got a good lead to something like that?  


Thanks in advance! Hoping to peak some young freshmen's interest enough to stick with advanced math courses for years to come....we'll see how that goes!"

517,The hype of data science?,datascience,t3_a09l6o,10,False,False,a09l6o,"Hello,

I am a european student in a statistics' bachelor (3rd year) and I am considering specializing in Data science for my master.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I kind of doubt whether this is actually a good idea... because : the market.

The profession of data science has been heavily mediatised and many people chose data science for their master as way to ""secure a job"". 

Along with that, pretty much every university have opened programs in "" ML-DL-CV-NLP-DataScience-Blockchain-GAFAM-StartupNation ""

&amp;#x200B;

I really dont like the idea of specializing in something... along with pretty much everyone else.

Supply and demand is what operates the markets. I m sure that the demand for data scientists is growing but so is the supply, maybe it grows even faster.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth it to go into that field now? Considering that I ll be out of college in 3 years and will need AT LEAST 3-5 years of experience before the companies start seeing me as somehow valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

In 10 years, will the supply be way bigger than the demand?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that I ve missed the right period to get into DS. 

I feel that if I were currently in 2008 (with my current age) specialized in DS and got my experience, I would be already an ""experienced DS"" in 2014 and would ve benefitted way more from the job growth that.. well... now... I feel that I m late by 10 years and would be way more interested in what is going to be the next ""data scientist like job"" for 2020-2030

But I wanted to get a general consensus on my background and chosen curriculum/courses to enter into this field. Thanks in advance for reading and helping!!

Background:

PhD in Materials Sciences from a mediocre university and 2 years of postdoc experience in the same field (materials chemistry, physics, nanotechnology). Currently working as a R&amp;D Engineer in a sensor company. I have preliminary statistical analysis and some curve fitting (linear, polynomial, Gaussian and Lorentzian) experience (2-4 hrs/week). My work is rather slow and TBH I find it rather boring. When I read about DS, I got fairly interested in it. Upon further reading about DS, I felt it would be apt career for me as it pays higher, I can work in the city (fraction from home as well), analytical nature of jobs and seems to have a continuous demand for manpower. With my current work, I can spend ~ 2hrs/day on weekdays and 4-5 hrs/day on weekends on learning DS and ML courses.

530,"Questions about use of ML in data science, insight fellow program, PhD transitioning to data science",datascience,t3_a05og2,7,False,False,a05og2,"Hi all. I am new here. I will be graduating with a PhD in aerospace engineering and scientific computing some time next year. I am strongly considering a career in machine learning/data science. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for advice on how to effectively make the transition, and things that I could do to strengthen my profile. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my background: 

My PhD is not based on machine learning or data science, but on developing and implementing physics-based models for atmospheric entry vehicles. Most of my PhD work is based on applying numerical methods and programming (techniques such as parallel computing and using non-trivial data structures such as graphs, hash tables, etc...) to solve these problems computationally, and assess the computational model's validity against experimental data. I work with a large amount of ""data,"" but I wouldn't say that I am working with large data in the ""statistical"" sense. Aside from my PhD research, I supplemented my lack of breadth (typical for PhDs) with graduate level courses in machine learning, deep learning, data mining, grad-level algorithms, artificial intelligence, computational data science, and numerical linear algebra and other numerical methods courses. I have not taken a pure probability course, but most of the courses listed above uses probability, so hopefully I have sufficient knowledge. 

I am also planning on implementing/introducing some deep learning techniques to my dissertation topic, and to my research community (no one uses ML in my research domain unfortunately), as sort of a ""cherry on top"" of my dissertation. I am proficient in C++, Fortran, Matlab, and Python. Oh and I go to a top 5 school in my field, if that's relevant...

&amp;#x200B;

I have NO industrial data science/machine learning experience. A friend of mine and I are developing a machine learning library as a side project as a learning experience, and we intend to participate in some Kaggle competitions. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this is basically my background, and I'm looking for advice on what I can do to improve my profile for a potential transition into data science/machine learning. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some other questions that I have are:

(1) How much of data science positions is just the application and implementation of machine learning methods? 

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Is the insight data science fellows program really worth it? I don't like the idea of taking a 100% pay cut for over a month if I can effectively/easily make the transition without the program. And how selective is the process? I can't seem to find any information on what the selection process is other than that it is ""very selective."" 

&amp;#x200B;

(3) This may be an ignorant question, and it may just be my lack of awareness, but I feel like the job titles that include ""machine learning"" usually exist at tech companies (e.g., Google, Facebook, Apple, etc...), and the title ""data scientist"" is for positions not at these tech companies, but most of these data scientists seem to be doing machine learning stuff. 

If this is true, why is this? How are the two differentiated? 

&amp;#x200B;

When I google ""top data science companies,"" I don't really see any big/well-known tech companies listed. Do these companies just not use the ""data scientist?""

His final book recommendation  - a book about ""Design Thinking"" is very surprising - he says  


&gt;Being a person who’s done a lot of data analysis, one thing that I’ve found frustrating is the lack of proper mental model for what is going on when you analyse data. Most universities have a class called ‘data analysis’, and typically it presents various useful tools, but rarely discusses what actually happens when you do the analysis itself. *Design Thinking* gives a mental model to describe what happens in this process

&amp;#x200B;

So it got me thinking - in my experience the most challenging and exciting part of working with data is thinking things through, seeing if I'm asking the right question, what we should be looking for, etc. Looking at it that way, that recommendation makes a lot of sense.

One is called the AI Data Developer and lasts 7 months (full time) with a 12 months apprentice contract at the end. I don't have all the information but it involves data processing, cognitive API, AI development, production and interface, soft skills, project management. The person I spoke to mentioned that there will be classes in python, R, and C++, databases, machine learning, SQL and that there will be certificates obtained (how useful or transferable they are I'm not sure).

The other is called Big Data designer - AI lasts for 50 days or 400 hours so by my estimates around 2-3 months. And at the end there is a permanent contract. They teach python (though I'm under the impression that perhaps they already expect me to know that, it's called python review), machine learning with SciKitLearn, Hadoop, Spark, something called Kafka and Elastic and also some project management and agile methods. Link in French: https://www.devenez.fr/pdf/Programme-formation_Concepteur-Big-Data-Intelligence-Artificielle_Fitec.pdf

I'm strongly leaning towards the latter as it is shorter and I'm not super young (mid thirties) and I'm thinking that any deficiencies in the program I can probably try to compensate for myself (I have a scientific background and am not a stranger to self learning, I've done some stats and linear algebra, lots of R courses (as well as scripting writing for work), I know how to code a bit and have done intro to statistical learning and a little bit of the Andrew Ng course). 

The latter course also posts a salary (30-40K euros) whereas the former they didn't say. But the former may be more rigorous (they are also partnered with Microsoft so I don't know if that's a plus). It appears that they both do many similar things.

We have our transactional database in SQL Server that our client-facing applications run on. 

We replicate this db server into our own data science servers but the data are always going to be a day behind (daily restores). Whenever we absolutely need real-time data, we hit our transactional database but our queries and stored procs are typically pretty heavy. The DBAs freak out whenever the data scientists need to create stored procs in our transactional servers. I feel like we need a near real-time replica server that is completely separate from our main transactional server. Our heavy queries should not bog down our applications.

Some hot takes I heard included:

* hacker stats is just code for people who don't know the math behind hypothesis tests
* hacker stats only subsumes simulation methods / Monte Carlo
* hacker stats is code for Bayesian A/B testing
* hacker stats just means any statistical analysis that relies heavily on simulation or re-sampling for inference

594,"For those of you working on research, how do you track work?",datascience,t3_9yxr5j,7,False,False,9yxr5j,"I had a conservation with my manager about how to track progress on research.  Part of the issue is that internally, we use JIRA, which uses tickets to track work.  If you're a software engineer, ""write X class"" is a concrete task with an obvious closure point, and it's unlikely to spawn additional work.

If you're a researcher, it's often unclear when a project is finished, and projects often spawn a ton of subprojects.  For example, if you're researching ""How do we detect whether a user saw an ad on TV?"", exploratory analysis will inevitably spawn subquestions, like ""How do we know at what time and place an ad was shown?"", which would then spawn ""Can we bug the advertising company to give us the data we need to determine at what time and place an ad was shown?""  This would be one branch of subquestions among many.  Some of them turn into dead ends, some of them are fruitful, and we might decide that some just aren't worth exploring.

My long term career goal is to pivot to a data analyst and eventually data scientist role. I think I’m on the right track for that (currently applying to part time masters degrees in stats, and I have some econometrics and programming background), but I need a little advice for my near-term steps. 

Basically, the work my team currently does is mostly in Excel and Business Objects. It’s a fairly non-technical team, just a lot of churning out spreadsheet reporting; I’m the only person who has any coding background (or statistical experience for that matter). 

I have access to Python, R, and Tableau currently. My goal is to start doing some analytics type work over the next few months, with the goal of shifting my role enough that I can try to push for a new job title/official role for myself, probably as a data analyst. I want to do a couple of things:

1. Automate some reporting in Python to help reduce the total amount of grunt work
2. Produce some light analytics work that would impress management

Like I said, currently there’s basically zero exposure to analytics of any kind currently, just basic reporting, so I think there should be some low hanging fruit I can exploit. Even pretty simple analytics would be new and hopefully mind blowing to my non technical team, especially if it delivers some real value. 

My question is: does anyone have any tips for some good models/starting points for a team with zero exposure to analytics? Our business is centered around our network of financial advisors, so I’m thinking of analyzing things like advisor productivity and retention based on variables like firm size, age, gender, etc., probably focusing on Python as my primary tool. I’m just looking for the best way to start with that basic analytics that would still look impressive and useful to a non-technical managerial team.

606,"As a business analyst, what can I realistically do to stay relevant in the future?",datascience,t3_9ycuu1,35,False,False,9ycuu1,"Hello! Hopefully this hasn't been asked too many times already.

I was at a Google Cloud Platform training seminar the other day as my company is beginning to adopt it for our day-to-day use. One of the speakers (manager of DS at another firm) mentioned how they had high preference for software engineers, because *""its easier to provide DS tools to a coder than to teach an analyst how to code""*.

With the exposure of DS I've had over the past year or two, I've gathered that the general sentiment is to code and be great at math/stats. When I look at the influencers in this space, I see people with PhDs in math/physics or some sort of proven programming background.

As for myself, I graduated with a business degree and I've maintained a career today because I'm well-versed in web/mobile analytics. When I perform my analysis, I'm essentially using analytics platforms (e.g. Adobe/Google), SQL when looking at online-offline data and spreadsheets to discover insights; like any BA would.

However, in my space, I'm slowly noticing data scientists build presence in the business space; like unicorns that can code, run models and *present analysis + insights.* And when I'm looking for other web/mobile related jobs, Python and R are already job description standards. I feel that BAs won't have the competitive advantage to compete against data scientists with software and/or doctorate backgrounds in the near future.

Today, I try to chip away at Datacamp or Python when I can. I've managed to get some basics down, like accessing APIs or running basic regression models. But I treat Data Science like a hobby, something I do for a few hours to a dozen a week (if I'm feeling it). Nonetheless, I don't have it in me to follow the footsteps of what accomplished data scientists have been through.

What can analysts like me practice and build in our ""playbook"" to stay relevant without having to pour 20+ hours a week to hone the craft? Or is DS a subject matter you just can't ""half-ass""?

Sorry for the long read and much thanks for any insights that come through!

Over this time, I created some templates which I use to quickly create plotly graphs, and I turned them into a little open-source project. 

It is just a little Python package which allows for the use of the awesome Plotly library without having to write tons of code. It has sped up my workflow, hopefully others will find it useful as well. 

You can see the project [here](https://github.com/def-mycroft/rapid-plotly) on Github. 

The below is the first part of the README on [Github](https://github.com/def-mycroft/rapid-plotly):

The [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) library facilitates the creation of beautiful and interactive graphs. However, it can easily require several hundred lines of code to create a presentable Plotly graph. Writing hundreds of lines of code every time a graph is needed isn't feasible for professionals whowork with data and it isn't fun for people working on side projects.

Use rapid\_plotly  to quickly create beautiful and interactive Plotly graphs, or use as a starting point to create your own toolbox of Plotly graph templates.

Current features:

* Functions designed to rapidly prototype Plotly graphs.
* Option to view graphs in Jupyter or to write graph to an html file.
* Barplots, optionally grouped, with error bars and custom hover text.
* Scatterplots, with custom hover text and option to overlay multiple datasets."

I have found a little script that just hides the code cells when run, but if there is code between some print cells it is obvious that the space between the different lines are not the same, due to cells just being collapsed  instead of removed, which doesn't look very professional. 

I think NBconvert can do something like what I need, but as I am using Windows I haven't been able to find any in depth tutorials on how to use it.

611,I have a question in Network measures essentials,datascience,t3_9ykxd1,2,False,False,9ykxd1,"Hi, all,

We all know that Centrality, Transitivity, Reciprocity are the measures of a network, but how can I calculate the ""average"" measures of a 25 nodes directed graph?

I'm expecting to do:

* Calculate network diameter and **average** closeness.
* Calculate **average** network betweenness.
* Calculate network density and **average** degree.
* Calculate network reciprocity and **average** transitivity.
* What is the **average** distance between two nodes?

I know how to calculate each node's

Does the ""average"" mean that I calculate each centrality and divide it by the nodes?"

1) the players are connected if they have passed to each other, there is only one connection even if they have made 20 passes with each other
2) the weight is used to indicate the amount of passes, high weight = many passes. Everyone seems to make this assumption but I don't understand why its done that way. Shouldn't weight be high if its a ""difficult"" path, or a longer path? So shouldnt the weight be the inverse of the amount of passes?

3) additionally when calculating some metrics that use shortest path between nodes. In football every player has often performed atleast one pass to another player, so usually its a fully connected network. Can distance be described using the average distance of the passes between two nodes or something? Sure the goalie has succesfully made a pass to the striker, but this pass is very risky, and most likely the shortest path to the striker is in fact through defender, to midfielder to striker. But since the striker and goalie is connected they have a distance of 0 (or 1?). But how can i represent the ""truth"" which is that the goalie to striker node isn't really the shortest path to the striker?


EDIT: I can easily visualize pass success rates, average distance of passes (""difficulty"" of passes"") through e.g. color coding and placement of nodes in a visualization. But how can I take these in to consideration when deriving network metrics?"

------------------------------------------------

Edit to answer the major questions being asked:

First of all thank you so much for the love! Really appreciate it.

My background - Stats undergrad from a rigorous school, no MS or PHD. Got a job as a business analyst, realized I could do more with my skills. 

After that, I hate to be a cliche but what got me the furthest was projects. Find reasons to get excited about the technology, build projects. Go to hackathons, build projects. Add stuff to your blog, github, etc. There are no MOOCs or blogposts that will get you the experience of actually trying to process and model real data with real data problems.

Once you do enough of these, you can start to talk data science with other professionals at a level of comfort that signals that you're not bullshitting just to get a job. 

One other piece of advice I have is to push yourself at your current role in the right direction. I realized that while my current job wasn't a data science role, there were non technical things I could do to help become a better data scientist eventually - things like getting really good at SQL queries, building visualizations and focusing on story telling around the data (even just in powerpoint format). 

Combining this with the more technical data science related stuff in my own time helped a lot - the business side of data science is underrated but often what employers are really looking for.

The last thing I wanted to share is that it was not easy, and interviewing is really hard. I was doing several personal projects, built a blog, participated in hackathons, participated in kaggle challenges, going to meetups, linkedin, etc. and I still bombed at the beginning. Doing these things got my foot in the door - I had the opportunity to interview for top companies such as Facebook but I tanked at the beginning. It was embarrassing and humbling - but do not give up! Take interviews whenever you get a chance just to practice those skills and eventually it will become more natural.

That's all for now, can add more based on interest! 



------------------------------------------------

Edit #2: Remembered one more thing. There are going to be haters on your journey. People will gatekeep, claim that you're not doing 'real data science', or say the market is overflooded with data scientist wannabes. There's probably some truth there, but I had to keep reminding myself that everyone starts somewhere, and in the end this is just a career choice for now. Not the end of the world - ignore them and keep pressing on.

I feel that there is a shortage of people who understand both healthcare and data science, hence this might be a good field to study. I know it will be very difficult in terms of the academic rigour, so I'm looking into a couple of full time Master Programs (links below). I am just wondering if anyone from a medical background has picked up data science after having worked for many years in healthcare? And how did you find the transition, particularly the academic rigour?

In terms of my background in maths, I have done some undergrad stats and calculus in my pharmacy degree over 10 years ago, which i have forgotten and then a bit more stats in a postgrad pharmaceutical economics course 4 years ago. However, I do enjoy maths and algebra.

**UPDATE:**

This was specifically for the product analytics team. I don't think I can reveal the actual questions, but the recruiter provides you materials to study for such as basic SQL and a page about Facebook's various products (which you can find with a simple Google search). You can use Python or R for the coding portion too, but I've heard from others that SQL is the easiest. To be honest, the actual SQL questions weren't extremely difficult. I was given a sample table and two SQL questions. I would practice different joins (inner, left, right, etc.) and when to use what clause, such as GROUP BY and ORDER BY.

Then you are asked to provide a solution to a hypothetical product analytic question. An example I saw on Glassdoor was ""How do you determine if two users went to the same high school? (Assuming that it is not on their profile)"".

If you pass this first interview, you will be tested on basic statistical concepts in the second. Unfortunately I am unable to give insight on the second interview, since I struggled with one of the SQL questions. It was my first ever internship interview, and my first time doing a coding interview so I guess my nerves got to me :(

637,"Anybody did the final exam for ""Introduction to Python for Data Science"" on EdX from Microsoft? Have a question about it.",datascience,t3_9y0h0i,0,False,False,9y0h0i,"Hi,
I just reached the final exam in this course, and have a question about it.

If you did it, can you tell me if the challenges are based only on the videos of the courses, or if they also cover the final labs?

In case anyone is wondering, my question is because the final labs cover knowledge that is not presented in the course, and are incredible more complex than anything else there.

Honestly I'm appaled by the  course. It is basically the same content that Datacamp offers (It is actually one of the DataCamp courses) and it's of a very basic level.

The way grading works is that there are some questions on EdX after a video, followed by a ""lab"" in Datacamp, and these are all rather simple and always take you by the hand a lot, to the point that is nearly impossible to not score 100%

EXCEPT that the final labs in the course are  rather complex, and there are questions that need solving with VERY complex Pandas features (That is if you don't know Pandas) that are never explained in the course.

Not to mention some exercises _ONLY_ accept a certain string as a solution (E.g, df.groupby['column'] is wrong but df.groupby.[""column""] is right).

640,NLP classification problem using TensorFlow sentence encoder and other parameters as features,datascience,t3_9xvtsz,15,False,False,9xvtsz," I have 150K tagged samples of technical support chats between customers and technicians. The chats are classified into 2: “resolved”/ “unresolved” sessions (66.6% and 33.3% of the distribution respectively).

Based on this data I am building a model that would predict the resolution for each chat once it ends.

So far I tried using sklearn.svm.**SVC** with the following measurements as features:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The tensorflow based sentence embedding of the entire sessions (512 dim vector)
2. The tensorflow based sentence embedding of the first question asked by the user (512 dim vector)
3. The length of the session - min\_max normalised
4. average message length of customer - min\_max normalised
5. average message length of technician - min\_max normalised
6. The overall number of interactions throughout the session - min\_max normalised

Additionally, as the SKlearn library is rather slow I am only using a portion of my data (\~30K samples)

So far results have been bad - all the predictions (100%) are of the bigger “resolved” classification.

What can I do to improve this model?

Maybe I need to use a different tool?

655,Looking for insight on Data Analysis on these job description,datascience,t3_9xsfmq,6,False,False,9xsfmq,"Hi everyone,

I'll keep this short because I was just finishing up this post and I got a blue screen, and lost everything I had typed for the past hour. hahahah dear god, here we go again. I'll laugh if the diagnostic test crashes my PC. Sorry for the format or misspellings in advance, I just want it to be done.

Basically I'm going to start applying for jobs on data analysis, and I need insight on whether what I'm preparing myself with is useful or not. Some information about myself. I'm 23 and a night time college student doing a BSc CIS. Recently I just finished a course on SQL, and found the whole design and visualization of data to be super fun and interesting. So much so that I've decided that this is something I want to pursue. Work experience was a part time job fixing and selling computers, been doing this for about a year now, and found it really boring since every thing that was damaged was the same 4 things, specially RAM. Left it about a month ago, and with my free time I've been finding more about the data analysis profession.

Now then, I'll List what I've been doing with my free time to prepare for the job, this will have things that I think are needed and those that I think would be fun to have some knowledge of. Afterwards, ill link and paste the description of 1 job listing that I feel has the most things in common with the rest job listings.

&amp;#x200B;

Things that I've been teaching myself are:

\-Statistics

\-SQL and Excel (I did take courses on these two but it was to general)

\-Power BI

\-Classification: Decision Trees and Model Evaluations

\-Starting this today. I'm looking to run some linear regressions to see the relationship between advertising costs and their expenditure.

\-I've lined up to learn Six sigma and their methodologies. But I'm not sure if it worth learning this yet.

\-Intermediate knowledge on Visual C# and basics of Java.

\-Down the line I'll look into R or Phyton.

\-I've seen VMware pop up in some job listing so I have it on the list of things to know about.

\-Hadoop analytics and Hbase (saw some listing that had these and I want to know if they're needed)

&amp;#x200B;

And that's about it, on things I'm doing. I saw somewhere some predictive analysis on determining the infected outburst of diseases, and I thought a similar project could be fun to better understand the spread of diseases.

&amp;#x200B;

The Insight I'm looking for is into what preparations I should be focusing on for a job as a data analyst.

The following list will be a job description that has what I've seen most listings for Data analyst have:

* Provide organization and management of case files
* Review data (completeness of information, proper execution)
* Extract data from data base
* Obtain additional information from other investigative agencies/data base
* Establish/maintain physical file
* Prepare notices/advertisements
* Receive, suspense petitions, claims, process sharing requests
* Reconcile inconsistencies
* Prepare declarations
* Gather information and organize investigative package
* Verify case files and case tracking system
* Maintain internal status information on the disposition of all forfeited assets
* Assure information is accurate and perform analytical computations necessary to process data
* Conduct and reconcile inventories
* Distribute and receive documents
* Assist lead analyst or official in obtaining/collecting all documents/information to complete case file
* Provide administrative information and assistance concerning case to  other investigative agencies, local law enforcement agencies, US  Attorney, and other DOJ processing units, and higher headquarters
* Extract data from agency data base for management and program reports
* Perform word processing relevant to case documentation
* Perform data entry relevant to case

I am currently at a crosscroads. I have finished my Masters in physics and was offered a PhD position on the physics of mobility. It is mostly theoretical research on how people migrate, and how certain transport modes (taxis, trains ride-sharing) behave at different scales. It involves a lot of simulations, and some data analysis, although nothing like deep learning.

Now my short-term goal is to contribute to science, in general, having some form of impact on society.

My long-term goal however is to ""not starve"", and not to jump from post doc to post doc, never really sure whether I will be sent to get another position. So I want to enter Data Science after my PhD. My question to you is how possible it is , with a niche field such as mobility physics. 

Is it okay to take the PhD position, or should I rather hope to get accepted for a PhD in a field like machine learning? Which is much less likely for me.

Have seen a few projects that use this approach, particularly for text classification. The idea is to 1) group similar text documents together (using e.g. levenshtein distance or word2vec embedding distance thresholds) to determine text document clusters. Then, 2) use the cluster identifier as a feature for a classifier to predict membership in some other class of interest.

There are some clear pitfalls to this - 

1. How do you determine a cluster id for a document that you've never seen before?
2. Do you run clustering once for your training set, once for test set? But then you have the same problem as 1) above where you can't determine groups for new documents.

So my question is - are there any academic treatments of this approach and the various problems that come up? Or some useful blog posts? Looking for theoretic foundations of the problems here - perhaps some ways forward!

In the examples so far, we did not have multilevel data and thus did  not fully use the capabilities of the distributional regression  framework of **brms**. In the example presented below, we  will not only show how to deal with multilevel data in distributional  models, but also how to incorporate smooth terms (i.e., splines) into  the model. In many applications, we have no or only a very vague idea  how the relationship between a predictor and the response looks like. A  very flexible approach to tackle this problems is to use splines and let  them figure out the form of the relationship. For illustration  purposes, we simulate some data with the **mgcv** package, which is also used in **brms** to prepare smooth terms.

678,Data Science Interviews - Attrition per Stage,datascience,t3_9xhkwr,14,False,False,9xhkwr,"Hey All,

As you may guess from the title, I'm deep in the data science interview process and just got a confidence-crushing rejection.

As such, I'm wondering if you all have insight into ""Attrition"" of the interview process. I'm defining attrition as the number of applications in stage i divided by the number of applicants in stage i-1. For the purposes of this question, I think its best to condition the problem by only considering applicants who got called back. The rate of resume application to call back is so variable and usually such a crap shoot if you apply online that I don't see it as useful (in my experience, it is maximum 10%).

I'm also assuming a standard interview structure of:

(i) Phone screen, usually with HR

(ii) Technical Screen, usually with Data Scientists

(iii) On-site interview(s)

(iv) Offer

So, what do you think is the fraction of applicants who get a phone screen to those who get a technical interview (e.g. 50% of phone screened applicants get a technical screen)? What fraction of technical screens get an on-site? And what fraction of on-sites get an offer?

Currently, I'm pretty good at (i) -&gt; (ii) with 6 out of 7 inviting me to the next round. But with technical screens I'm 1 for 3 so far (with more pending). I haven't gone to my one on-site yet.

It is my experience that seemingly simple analysis requests (stuff like “we noticed a change in X in markets M1 and M2 after we introduced Y, is it a good idea to implement Y in all remaining markets?”) will devolve quickly. Questions get changed, scopes increase mid-analysis, the analysis answers completely different questions, the requesters themselves don’t know what they need to see in order to be convinced of anything, fellow analysts and superior will tell you to change things but yet explain why it makes sense. I normally end up asking a lot of questions that people ignore or hand-wave away and then get stuck because nothing is clear anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26 years old, almost 27. Got a bachelors in physics from local university in South America and luckily got into a physics masters in an ivy league school. Struggled, but graduated with a GPA that can go on a resume. Then, decided physics was not for me and learned about data science through MOOCs. Got my first job in an early stage startup in my home country after 4 months of study (my scholarship didn't allow me to stay in the US). Got frustrated with the lack of guidance (just two technical people: a software engineer and I) and changed to a big consulting company after 7 months. Worked there for 6 months. Lot's of politics, questionable practices and unprofessional coworkers. The technical people were..  weak and I felt like I was the most senior person that could be called DS there (not my merit, but company's demerit). So I quit and joined a second 1 year master's program (CS with DS focus), in Europe (which has affordable education). One semester of courses later I got an internship that was partnership between university's lab an tech company. In the company no one had a clue about ML and the lab professor was nice, but not able to do much outside his ML math (example: in the first week he told me I could use his C implementation of MLP for my text classification task).

&amp;#x200B;

During and after my internship I applied to lots of jobs. Got countless rejections and 3 offers. 2 big tech companies and a startup where the only DS was leaving. I chose the one that seemed best, one of the big ones which seemed to have a fair amount of other DS. I started this week and I was able to see some code from my peers and.. wasn't really what I expected. Some questionable methodologies from both machine learning and software engineering angles. Yesterday my boss made it clear in a meeting that he thinks GloVe is an library with a word2vec implementation. The overall vibe of the office is also unpleasant to me and there are some other personal stuff that makes it harder (everyone I care about, including gf is 7000 km away from me or more).

&amp;#x200B;

This will sound weird, but I miss having a reason to feel the impostor syndrome. When I was studying physics, there was always people so much smarter than I was, from which I could learn and hope to be as good one day. And now for years I feel surrounded by not so competent people. And this is not because all smart brains are in physics and dumb people go to DS, but because only the ""dumb"" ones offered me jobs. I'm sure there are a lot of DS 3 years younger than me who make more money than I do in the city.

&amp;#x200B;

I have bad software engineering skills. I have never really studied classic algorithms. I mean, I wouldn't be able to pass a software engineer whiteboard interview. I never really used SQL in real world. In all my experiences I had csv or json files.  I can do some queries after doing some hacker rank, reading w3 schools and transferring knowledge from R or Pandas. I can't put a model in production. I never used AB testing. Most of what I did was similar to Kaggle competitions or Kernels with some additional steps before and after. I know the real basics of pyspark, but again never had to use in real life. I think I am very good at problem solving with machine learning, I have a good practical and theoretical understanding of ML, I could spot issues in most ML problems I saw in the past and I did well in many ML competitions.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm stuck in a local minima. I cannot get jobs where I'll work with smart people cause I'm not that good, but I cannot get better because some things are just tough to learn by yourself. I've tried to give ""momentum"" by studying by myself, but it only helped until a certain point. I'm far from everyone I care about, with an idea that in Europe things would be better career-wise, but I didn't land the job that would fulfill me in that way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not dumb. I achieved many things most wouldn't. Everyone I worked was very happy with my work. But I am stuck. I'm afraid to have another 6 months of less experience in my resume and that no one will hire me because I don't stick around. I feel like quitting my current job and this is my first week. I'm afraid in a few months I will have more time experience, but less value to time ratio (""so you have 3 years of experience as DS but can't put a model in production, don't know about a/b testing, no real experience with analytics, don't know shit about spark, hadoop, docker and all those technologies that sound like pokemon names? Sounds like a junior""). I consider applying to jobs back in my home country where competition seems to be less and I may have more chance in good teams. I really don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Some details of my failed interviews:

Most application processes start with a take home task to do some EDA or maybe ML. I passed all of them, but then in the interview I sucked and got rejected. In one company (1 in their area, where data science is core) they said my task was one of the strongest they had ever seen, but still my answers in the interview were vague (this one was more data science analytics). I agree with them, as I had no experience with a/b testing (important for them), had only heard about multi armed bandits and couldn't answer well what the distribution of revenue per user should look like. In another one, again I passed the task and in the technical interview I was able to answer questions related to the tech around a ML model in production. The feedback was I was too junior (although this was literally a 'data scientist junior' position and I had previous experience). For another one I passed the first technical interview after the task, and got rejected in the last one after a lot of questions related to optimizing delivery algorithms. For another one they wanted someone either with better software engineering or deep learning skills. For 2, I failed classic coding tests. For 3, of them I got rejected after apparently passing all technical. For many I didn't even get interviews.

Hey, I'm not really in the big data or data science world but a requirement of a mobile application I'm building is to see live stats from users. These starts are not generated a lot really, only on user register, on game start, game end.  At first I was doing Kafka + Hadoop (HDFS) + Spark but this was pretty complicated. 

I'm starting to reach my deadline for this task and kind of getting desperate. I wanted to send events to Kafka and have consumers just push them to S3 in Avro file format for long term storage as well also sending it to a Time Series Database (InfluxDB) for querying from Garfana. However, even with just trying to get my Kafka consumers to work is being difficult. I'm wondering if I can just send my events directly to my time series database and periodically backup my data to S3 via that DBs backup tool and cronjob. Essentially removing the Kafka buffer. I can monitor the system and see how it's performing so I know how urgently I need to iterate to phase 2 with a more robust system. Our user base is &lt; 40,000 and only 1 person (internal) will be using the Grafana dashboard for app analytics.

I will keep this as short and simple as possible: I am a junior (junior age wise, little behind in credits) studying Statistics and CS at a large state school with a decent program in both. 

I am actively looking for an internship for the summer in the data/software area (data analyst, data science, software dev/engineer, etc.) to gain experience, since my resume is pretty weak (one data entry ""internship"", no side-projects (WIP), customer service jobs, no clubs). I have applied to 30+ places and have gotten denied at about 10 so far. I am applying to a ton more to this day and will through the winter/spring.

I have heard back from a ""Data Science internship"" which is ""unpaid/for credit"". It is with my state's major league soccer team. I feel I am relatively qualified  (pretty familiar with R/Python when ""some experience"" is a requirement). They want to set up a phone interview soon.

I guess I am posting because I don't know if I should be careful since it is unpaid. I've heard very negative things from a lot of people about unpaid internships in this field. However, I am not too confident I will find anything better, and I really want to gain actual experience. I work a part time serving job and a campus job so I should have some kind of income for the summer. If I did end up getting offered a position, what can I expect? Is it worth it? Does anyone have any experience in these kind of situations? Any feedback is super helpful and I appreciate it.

**Note:** I posted in this sub because I wanted input from people in the actual field. If it would be better to post in r/jobs or a CS sub I will do so. Thank you!

712,Non-STEM postgrad as a data scientist,datascience,t3_9wxsyl,3,False,False,9wxsyl,"Using a throwaway.
The context is that I've been working for about a year out of college in a small analytics startup, and I'm applying for postgraduate studies for either next year or the year after. My core interest has always been urban planning and architecture: I dropped out of architecture school and went to CS because I hated how design decisions were made without any awareness of evidence as to what works for users. I'm considering going back to school for an urban planning program with a strong design focus, but in a school that has a strong tech community, and I intend to continue working on all my projects from a data angle. 

The place I'm working has a really lean team, by which I mean I'm the only guy who knows what's really needed to run the tech side of things besides my project manager, who isn't as involved in the product design. The senior data scientist has experience, but none of it has been in working in a production environment, and faced with the task of setting up a proper CI pipepine here he's shown very little interest, and I've had to deal with it alongside vendors and my project manager. Meanwhile, the actual ML side has been very ad-hoc, practically pre-sales engineering where we slap shit together to try to close deals even before we're done building the final product platform. Move fast, break things still requires some manpower and organisation...

Consequently I'm learning a lot about setting up infrastructure in a scalable way, consulting contractors, ex-bosses, and colleagues from past internships and going to tech meetups which are thankfully very numerous in my city. But I worry that going to a non-quantitative postgraduate course would dilute my credos as a technical guy. I want to spend more time than I'm able to looking at tools like Hyperopt and getting more experience actually bringing business-critical data projects through the whole process of ETL, modeling, crossvalidation and so forth, but half the time I'm tied up with infrastructure development and testing while my senior data scientist spends three weeks in a row fiddling with hyperparameters for a single client that he's manually tuning and tracking in Notepad. Once I'm confident in setting shit up for production I want to go somewhere where I can focus on ML use cases, ideally actually related to urban problems... But I'm worried that getting a non-STEM postgrad would hurt my career.

I could attempt to do the same by going to a CS or math program and angling my projects from an urban perspective... but I think the outcome would be quite different. I'd love to work with places that deal with urban use cases like Sidewalk Labs or the Geo team, but I'd also love to work at tech shops that have to figure out what's happening and what to do with communities that have some kind of direction, like Discord as opposed to Facebook. Going all the way back however, my original goal was to find a way to shake things up in the big engineering and design firms like Arup, Mott Macdonald; urban planning and design consultancies including government offices, and even architecture firms. The plan was always to be credible by accomplishing stuff in data science before trying to enter that industry, but even with that there's also a lot of resistance to outside suggestions if you're not a professional in that sphere, like an engineer, architect, or urban planner. So a postgrad in that area seems important to some degree.

I guess I'm looking for some insight and opinions on what you think the best way to look at this conundrum is. How bad does it look if it all doesn't pan out and I stay in STEM jobs at STEM companies? If I'm not working in urban planning and design, I don't have much patience for non-tech companies, tried that schtick in bulge bracket and hated being a second-class citizen in the company ecosystem. Diving into ML research on a STEM masters would be self-indulgence, I'd love to do it but it keeps me away from my goals... What would you do?"

So my question is: what are some ways I can impute nulls in these columns? I’m not thinking of doing KNN or anything, as a zero is much different from a null value in my case. I’m thinking some negative number, like -999 might serve as kind of a “class” for the decision tree to pick up on and segregate accordingly. "

Most models will be baseline models, so do not need anything complex beyond boosting/random forests.

&amp;#x200B;

Since we already have Alteryx and they're set on using it (analysts use it for ETL).

Also, the integration from Alteryx and Tableau is kind of nice when I need to create visualizations to prove the success of the model.

I'll give a quick summary of where I came from, where I am, and where I'm going for context:

BS in Risk Analysis (IT/Stats type hybrid) in '10, since then I've worked in the US intel community doing all kinds of fun stuff, used my background to help pioneer some pretty cool data innovations for one of the big three letter agencies. I consider myself more a intel analyst/data analyst combo, but my job title has been 'Data Scientist' on a number of occasions, enough that I'm known as a Data Scientist in the USIC (again, non-tech people assigning titles here). I'm half way through my MS in Data Science from a well known university. I'm also looking to transition out of DC to a smaller town (Philly area), and as such would probably leave my roll in the USIC where I have built quite a good reputation....

Jumping back into the job market has been a bit of a shock, and I attribute this mostly to the complete lack of awareness surrounding the definition of 'Data Science'. For every 10 job postings for Data Scientists that I've looked at, I feel like everyone is a completely different job and covers such a wide set of skills that I feel woefully underprepared for any of them. 

I have a good grasp on statistics, I can code/know R/Python/VB/SAS/SQL (although I wouldn't consider myself 'coder fluent', I can figure out anything, it just takes time and some SO/google-fu), I'm a capable business person (I've briefed to high level stakeholders, can communicate and write well, etc...), my critical thinking/data munging/manipulation I would class as 'expert'. So at the core, I feel like a competent 'true data scientist'...

So this is where my question really begins - 

We've all seen some version of the [DS venn-diagram](http://www.prooffreader.com/2016/09/battle-of-data-science-venn-diagrams.html)...and thats all fine and dandy, but I dont think that accurately represents what companies want in a DS. So what skills do I need to work on to be that more complete package, and how do I go about learning the skills? 

**TL;DR: For someone who already has stat/coding/domain knowledge - what are the full life cycle DS processes that one would also have to be fluent in, or at least have a strong grasp of - especially in a full stack perspective - and subsequently what are the best ways to learn them.**

The firm is currently supporting a nonprofit charity and is advertising to find donors for the charity. The amount of money the firm raises for the charity, and the firm's satisfaction ratings from the charity are the metrics investors are using to decide how much support to provide.

I just graduated with a B.S. in mathematics with probability and experimental design courses in Statistics. If I'm given the job, the Salary will be $30000-$35000 a year.

Can you help me brainstorm what sort of analysis I can do to find trends to improve satisfaction rating, receive more money from investors and generate more revenue for the charity?

1) look at the categorical and quantitative features of the investors to see which features and interests are associated with more funding and continued funding. Figure out the potential for investment based off investor net worth and contributing factors.

2) Figure out what other areas the investor would like to support. Find out metrics that return the most benefit to the firm's investors.

3) would I use surveys to gather this data along with individual research?

4) Identify potential investors with similar traits to  current investors.

5) Examine demographic data the charity collects to identify target audiences

6) Create surveys figuring out what contributes to satisfaction rating

7) Perform an analysis like a split plot to determine what advertising methods work the best with which demographics

8) Do a cost/return analysis of various advertising methods.

9) Have the sales team members keep short logs of how they interacted with potential donors to see which metrics have the greatest effect on donation amount relative to the theoretical amount that donor could afford and/or relative to the median/average donation, and use this to inform the Boss to make decisions in Sales training off his instinct/experience/this data.

That's a start, and I need to figure out how I would calculate these metrics. What else can I do?"

Currently i am training a model and evaluating it with the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
Now, i am running into some problems with this. 
What i want to do is get the lowest MAPE. 

One problem is as follows. 
When the MSE is going down, the MAPE might oscillate within a magnitude of 10^3 . 
Now one would think: why not just use the MAPE loss function, if the a lowest MAPE is the goal?

This will bring up the second problem. 
For some reason using MAPE as a loss function is not working out for me at all. 
I'm using Keras and am working with a LSTM model, but that shouldn't matter i guess.
When using the MAPE as a loss function, i am getting values of like 60.000 %.... While using MSE as a loss function the best values i get are ~60%...

How should one tackle this problem and/or what is going wrong?
I'm having the feeling that this either is some basic question, or a theory problem. 
That's the reason i'm not posting any code right now.

750,Advice for mathematics teacher moving into data science in an interesting situation,datascience,t3_9wdk62,9,False,False,9wdk62,"I would appreciate hearing some opinions from those in the know about my future study and career plans.

**Background:**

I have a masters in pure mathematics from a highly ranked UK university. I did almost no programming at university and a little statistics. The focus of my masters was topology, manifolds, Lie groups etc, if that means anything to anyone here :) Of course I have studied Linear Algebra in depth and am really enjoying learning the statistics that is new to me. Since graduating I have been teaching mathematics at High School level in International Schools around the globe for the past 6 years. But now I am looking to try something new.

**Study so far:**

For the past 2 years I have been studying Computer Science topics and programming. I have taken Database Management Systems (MySQL) and Intermediate Software Design in Python through Foothill College online. Then I have done various MOOCs including CS50 and Stanford Algorithms. I am almost finished with ""Python For Data Science And Machine Learning"" on udemy and have really enjoyed it. It doesn't go into the mathematics, so at the same time I've been reading ISLR. I'm then going to go through ISLR once again but doing the exercises in R. I'm looking forward to then moving onto The Elements of Statistical Learning to really get into the details of the mathematics. I'm also picking up a lot more books when I'm home for winter break that I'm going to sink myself into :D

I have come to the conclusion that a career in Data Science is going to combine my love of mathematics, data, programming etc into one I will really enjoy and (hopefully) be good at.

**Personal situation:**

I will be working full time (studying in spare time) until June 2019. Then I am in the lucky position of being able to stay at home, whilst my (very supportive) partner works another year until June 2020. I will be both studying and being a parent (with childcare). I live in a developing country with few options for local experience in the field (though I need to research this further). The plan is then to move to my partners home city (Seattle) in the summer of 2020 and for me to find a job :)

**Options for the next year and a half:**

So I am currently weighing up my options for the next year and a half before we move around the globe. I have looked at some data science bootcamps and I could do similar stuff on my own: building up a portfolio, writing a blog, contributing to open source software, entering kaggle comps, building personal projects etc. The great thing is I will be able to go much more in-depth with the topics compared to a bootcamp as I'll have so much more time. The downside is I will not have the career guidance, interview prep, help with LinkedIn etc.

Another option I am looking at is starting the Georgia Tech OMS Analytics Masters. I do like the structured learning of a full university course and the course descriptions [sound really interesting](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics?section=curriculum). It does sound like it would be a real challenge to finish in a year and I think I would only be able to start Fall 2019.

Sorry for the wall of text. I'd appreciate any feedback, ideas, words of encouragement, thoughts on my situation.

**TLDR: Mathematics background transitioning to data science. Has a year and a half (with one year of full-time study, portfolio work, maybe masters) until move to the US and trying to change to a career in Data Science. Advice?**"

I have a question I've been searching for quite a while but I have not found a solution yet, so I''d like to ask you for your help.

So, I'm currently working on a project (using R at the moment) that currently works the following way:
- Perform surveys regarding product variations;
- From the surveys, select the variations we'd like to analyze (these may vary in quantity in each analysis as we so desire);
- R scripts takes in the inputs and processes the structured data and spits out graphs (using data in long format, plotting with ggplot2 currently);
- Graphs are then manually edited on a Powerpoint file so that an image of the product corresponding to each variation is underneath its corresponding codename in the graph.

We're at a point that we'd like to automatize almost everything but the very last part I'm having tremendous difficulty with. I can write code to read the variables we choose, select the corresponding image file [most of them are same size] from the main directory, import it to R, but I cannot seem to place the images either replacing the x-axis ticks of the ggplot or just below it [preferred] - I found a blogpost regarding country flags and tried the code but ratio of the images was odd and non-intuitive to adjust, at least for me.

In a first stage I'd like to know if anyone could help me finding how to do this using R (get coordinates for each x-axis tick and somehow place the image underneath?) so I could add to my R Markdown file and Shiny app [in the words] (or Python, though I'm less proficient on that).

Secondly, to deploy this inside a web-browser autonomously, what would you recommend? Not too familiar with other tools, so I was thinking on deploying Shiny app inside the website but might run a bit slow, not sure. Open to suggestions for other languages such as js or similar, but then we'd have to hire someone for that.

Thanks!

PS: On mobile, so I cannot provide sample data unfortunately, but the structure is basically: ""user"", ""email"", ""product_code"", ""likert_scale"" (500-2000 rows for each file) at a time."

However what I found is that the identically defined model (same number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, optimizer etc) when learned using Keras performed absolutely terribly (9%). I was able to get a model that worked through a significant reduction in the number of nodes per layer, but I was surprised that this was necessary.

An initial guess would be that the Keras model is over fitting, but that doesn't feel intuitively right to me either as model accuracy is low on the train data as well as the test data.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated."

767,Closest Python Equivalents for Major R Packages?,datascience,t3_9w0llq,24,False,False,9w0llq,"Hi all!

So I am presently in the process of attempting to bring Python into my division (which is very heavy on R), and am periodically building out code [walk-throughs](https://github.com/pmaji/data-science-toolkit) and example use cases to show what Python can do in situations where we presently use R. I am **very** new to Python, so I wanted to ask you all: ""for each of the R packages below, what equivalents exist in Python that you would say present similar functionality?"" I have given the list my best shot below, but would love to hear the thoughts of more experienced Pythonistas!

P.S. I'd also love to hear your thoughts about the relative strengths of the alternatives. For example: do you think Bokeh can only do half of what Shiny can do, but Dash can do everything Shiny can and more (that's not my opinion, just an example)?

P.P.S I'd also love to know what other R packages you can think of that are central in data science that have an obvious Python parallel. Really, I'm trying to build up a solid understanding of where the comparative package-specific advantages and disadvantages lie when comparing the two languages (but am not trying to turn this into a ""which is better"" conversation, which will devolve into chaos""). Thanks y'all!

* Shiny / Shiny Dashboard (R) (Used for: web-hosting, app building, deployable interactive viz.)
   * Dash (Python)
   * Flask Apps (Python)
   * Bokeh Apps (Python)
* Ggplot (R) (Used for: static visualizations that don't need to be interactive)
   * Matplotlib (Python)
   * Seaborn (Python)
* plotly / ggplotly (R) (Used for: interactive visualizations)
   * Bokeh (Python)
   * Plotly (Python) -- I'm hesitant about this though b/c I think it's a paid API for corporate
* glm (R) (Used for: model-building)
   * statsmodels (Python)
   * scikit-learn (Python)
* tidyverse (R) (Used for: data-wrangling and tidying data)
   * pandas (Python)
   * what else?

Edit: added parentheticals next to each major bullet point to explain what utility / use case from the R package in question I wanted to find in a python equivalent.

I’ve been doing more-or-less data science work for about two years at a very large, very established company. You would know the name if I mentioned it. I do some modeling but, honestly, most people just want graphs and tables of particular things they suspect would lead to something profitable.The requests are often something like, “Hey, I think there may be a relationship to XYZ and decreased customer churn. Can you throw together some views for me?”  The higher up you go, the less people trust fancy models that they can’t understand. They want a nice scatter plot that makes it obvious. And I get that. You gotta sell an idea somehow.

Anyway, I’ve started working on more high profile projects. One project started about 9 months ago and required getting a large data set from a vendor. This took months. In the meantime, more and more high level people started talking about it. The idea of the project was to show that action X would reduce customer churn. This was pretty much assumed to be true, and the analysis was necessary to figure out how much of action X, when, and how much benefit we could expect.

People got excited about this. SVPs we’re checking in on the status, anxiously awaiting the benefits. When planning for next year, many tacitly assumes this would bring a boost to overall sales and would help them meet more aggressive targets.

The only problem is they’re all wrong. We got the data and I’ve been crunching it for a month now. No matter how you model it, graph it, slice or dice it, this relationship they assumed existed doesn’t. Now the supervisor on the project is freaking out. We spent a lot of time on this and a lot of money on the data. People expect to see at least some kind of result. This morning, I was told that “we have to deliver what they expect, even in a small way. We can’t just say there’s nothing here worthwhile.”

I’m starting to feel like I’m expected to manufacture results that simply aren’t real. I don’t feel very comfortable with that. And since this started, I’ve noticed that similar problems are not uncommon. People use analyses based on sparse data and unsound conclusions to make convenient decisions. It seems like an unspoken fact that when someone higher up wants to see something you more or less find a way to show that to them. Doing so will get you noticed and promoted. Fussing about statistical significance and data credibility will just annoy people. If I had to guess I’d say 25% and maybe up to 50% (depending on the director) of our conclusions lack credibility. None of these decisions hurt people or customers; they really just lose us money. But still.

I already know not finding something in this project will negatively affect me—whether it be my performance rating or passed up for promotion. It’s really stressing me out. I’ve started drinking a lot more and it’s definitely hurting my health. Anyone deal with anything similar? Advice? Is this common?"

I am a materials engineer with some background in machine learning.

If I have process A that is causing some issues and I change to process B hoping to get better results, how can I statistically analyze that process B is actually better? 

Moving beyond simple coin toss explanations, how do I compute p-value and confidence intervals in a real-world problem with multiple control variables and a range of possible outcomes?

If you have 1000 features and 1 billion rows, how would you approach the problem in terms of reducing the number of features for creating Machine learning models? Also, we know what features mean, how many numerical and categorical features we have, etc. 

I answered the question as following-

1. First, we will find the distribution of classes in the response variable to determine whether we need to re-sample the data-set if it's a rare event problem
2. We can drop features which has more than 50% missing values.
3. We can drop categorical features if the occurrence of a class is below a threshold, let's say 20 in 1 million rows.
4. We can find correlation between features and drop features if they are highly correlated (He caught me here as it's not feasible to identify correlations from a correlation graph with 1000 features)
5. We can perform PCA on numerical features, select top K components which explains 95% variance, combine with categorical features and run machine learning models.

Then, he asked what if we want to explain which features were important in prediction as it won't be possible with PCA. I couldn't answer this part. I was not able to ask him what was the right response to this question as we were out of time. And I couldn't find a proper answer to this question over internet. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I thought about it later, can we just use Random Forest after step 3 as it performs the feature selection part itself? And this way we can explain which variables are important. But this does not help if we want to reduce the number of features."

\- I've started off with the simplest possible approach - [Attribute Value Frequency (AVF)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4410382) algorithm.  
\- I'm getting some results (kind of), but the problem with AVF is that it does not cater for correlations between different features.

**What I'm thinking of doing:**  
\- The [apriori algorithm](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori-Algorithmus) seems to be somewhat similar to what I need. But it is not meant for Outlier detection (low support regions) but for finding the mode of the distribution (high support regions).  
\- I was thinking of somehow using an 'reverse apriori algorithm' (if one exists) for my problem of outlier detection. After a quick search, I have noticed that people have indeed tried going in such directions.

Many important issues---such as climate change or election polls---require communicating quantitative information to the public, many of whom do not encounter graphs, charts, or data visualizations in everyday life. Yet a well-crafted data visualization, like any well-crafted piece of journalism, can communicate  important information to anyone, regardless of background. Such pieces of data journalism play an important role in informing the public.

I imagine this varies by industry and company size, but what are some DL success stories where ML fell short and DL was absolutely necessary, or the incremental benefit of DL justified the time and resources poured in?

I am not a data scientist (neither a student, nor a professional) so apologies if this question is below the grade of this sub.

I am making a web crawler to try to find web pages that match a certain criteria. I wrote a python script that takes a starting url and then traverses the web using a breadth-first search using the starting url as node-0, avoiding loops etc.

My goal is to find websites for small businesses. My scraper currently takes all the human-visible text data from the sites it visits, which I am hoping to be able to turn into a classification model. My two questions are:

**1) What are good starting URL's to make sure my crawler has the greatest likelihood of seeing a broad sample of websites?**

**2) What  algorithms/models should I look into using to find websites similar to other websites based on the visible text info on the site? I think there are NLP algorithms like ""bag of words"" etc. that might work, but just wondering what your 2-cents on this is.**

819,Email Marketing Lead Scoring Classifier,datascience,t3_9v54s9,11,False,False,9v54s9,"I'm tasked with evaluating an email marketing lead scoring system, i.e. a system that tracks interactions with emails and a website, assigns a point value to each interaction, and when the point total reaches a certain threshold the person is passed to a sales team. After being passed to the sales team, the sales team attempts to contact the person and if successful a ""sales opportunity"" is generated. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my goal is to determine how much ""weight"" each of these interaction types should be given. I'm thinking about it as a regression problem - ""'probability of generating an opp' \~ 'interaction type 1' + 'interaction type 2' + ... + 'interaction type n'"".  

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dataset of \~2600 leads, \~93% of which did not results in a sales opp. My idea is to create a predictive model and use this model to inform decisions about the lead scoring weights in the sales pipeline (i.e. the number of points given to each interaction type). 

&amp;#x200B;

I fitted a penalized logistic regression model using the brglm R package and have slightly over 93% accuracy, and the confusion matrix has only like 5 positive predictions. So, the model doesn't appear to be very informative (it is just guessing ""False"" most of the time to achieve the 93% accuracy rate). The AUC score is like 0.65, but it doesn't seem to mean very much given that the model isn't beating ""no information rate"". 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Recharacterize the problem? Try a different model (Bayesian maybe)? Downsample the False class and do some sort of bootstrap? Something else?  "

823,Use historical data to construct a forecast tool,datascience,t3_9uyxla,3,False,False,9uyxla,"Hello guys! I dont know if this is the right place for this question but I will give it a try. Apologizes in advance if it isn't! (Also posted this in r/algorithms)

Basically, I would like to develop a forecast tool which predicts the energy consumption for a specific city for the next day. I choose a city which is located near me to test this on. For this city I have two data sets: First: The weather data from a whole year in a 10minute interval. Here is a snippet of the data: https://imgur.com/K7w0u1l Second: Energy consumption data from a whole year in a daily interval. There are a total of 1660 power meters which provided this data. Here is a snippet: https://imgur.com/J5zoAAZ (Unit in kWh, every column represents one meter).

My question is: Can I, based on this past data, develop an algorithm (which will be feeded with the forecasted weather data from the next day) that will return the energy consumption forecast for the next day? I had an idea on how I could maybe approach this but I have the feeling that this method is very trivial. I will try to explain it to you with an example: So lets say I get the forecasted weather data. In this data, the average air temp. is predicted with 20 degrees Celsius and the average relative humidity is predicted with 80%. Now I assign both data points a tolerance range from some value. Lets say I assign the temperature a tolerance of +/- 2 degrees and the humiditry a tolerance of +/- 3 percent. Now I go searchig in my database. First, I look for a historical datapoint from the air temperatures where the value was in the tolerance range from the predicted value. So, in this example: 18 =&lt; x =&lt; 22. If I find one, I check if the value of relative humidty is in the tolerance range of the predicted humidty. So, in this example: 77 =&lt; y =&lt; 83. If this also applies, I save the date from when this happened and use the energy consumption from this date as my forecasted consumption. Of coure I would also need to account for new meters (because the city probably grows and so the consumption will also rise) and for the season in which the next day is in (because consumption is generally higher during winter than summer).

I also already played a bit with the historical datas and calculated the correlation from some datapoints with the energy consumption. Here is a table: https://imgur.com/I5Iz0Id As you can see, in sommer and winter the temperature had a high correlation with the energy consumption, while in spring and autumn the correlation wasn't that high. So probably I will also need to account for this in my algorithm...

I would guess that there are much much much better ways to do this with more advanced mathmatical methods but I'm currently only going to school and I'm not really familiar with higher statistics/mathematics. I would be really interested in any other approaches to this problem from people which are way more profound in this topic.

The challenge is that I have no formalized training in the field – just on-line boot camps, books and 3 years worth of R experience. I also understand that R is starting to become looked down upon in comparison to other data science languages (Python, SAS).

861,Is a BSc in Mathematics a good path to later specialize in Data Science if I already work as a developer?,datascience,t3_9ug6ti,7,False,False,9ug6ti,"A bit of background: I don't have any diploma, but I have now 1 year of experience as a software developer (specifically full stack developer in the banking sector, i work for a tech company whose customers are exclusively financial institutions, not directly for a bank). 
 
I am thinking on starting a Distance Learning BSc with Open University (it is a respectable british public university, I'm not interested on opinions regarding distance learning). 
 
Their BSc in Computing and IT does not look very appealing to me, specially because I audited their courses / exams and I already know many of those things, it would be a relatively ""easy"" degree however if I'm making the effort and also paying a considerable amount I would like to learn something. 
 
One of the options I'm considering are the BSc in Mathematics. With my current income I would have enough savings to do a full time masters in a reputable brick university without having to work, and I expect to get raises / etc along the way (I just got a 50% raise after 10 months working in my current position). 
 
The curriculum for the BSc in Mathematics would be (note that in the OU seems like Level 1 courses are rather easy, where level 2 and 3 have a high increase in difficulty): 
 
Level 1: 

- Discovering Mathematics (very basic math, can be exchanged for other course which I would do, probably introduction to physics).

- Essential Mathematics 1 (covers Functions, Trigonometry, Vectors, Calculus, Matrices, Sequences and Complex Numbers) 

- Essential Mathematics 2 (covers Number theory, Conics, Geometric transformations, Mathematical language and proofs, further calculus, differential equations, mechanics, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, combinatorics) 

- Introduction to statistics (covers statistical vocabulary and notation, selection and use of statistical techniques. Makes heavy use of Minitab 17 software). 
 
Level 2:
 
- Pure mathematics (covers Group Theory, Linear Algebra, Analysis). This is a 2 semester module.
- **can choose between:**
 - Mathematical methods, models and modelling (another 2 semester module) (the description of this module is more complex, can be seen here: http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/qualifications/details/mst210?orig=q31&amp;setAcc=true)
- **OR**: 
 - Analysing Data (more statistics)
 - Mathematical Methods (analytical (as opposed to numerical) solution of first and second-order ordinary differential equations is discussed, followed by linear algebra (vectors, matrices and determinants). Elements of the calculus of functions of several variables, including vector calculus, which is followed by an introduction to methods for solving partial differential equations.

Level 3:

- **4 of the following:**
 - Applications of probability
 - Complex analysis
 - Deterministic and stochastic dynamics
 - Electromagnetism
 - Further pure mathematics (number theory, groups, numbers and rings, metric spaces, rings and fields)
 -  Graphs, networks and design
 -  Linear statistical modelling
 -  Mathematical methods and fluid mechanics
 -  Mathematical statistics
 -  Optimization
 -  Mathematical thinking in schools (no)
 -  The quantum world (no)

And if you use smote then there is a possibility that your data is not real and your model becomes fit to unreal data. I find that I get good results by undersampling but when I upsample then I have a cross validation score of something like [.3, .976, .945, .988, .1]. Should I be doing something different?

Has anyone had any success modelling the generative process (using e.g. PGMs) and sampling from a joint distribution to generate more data to improve the performance of ML models?  Or has anyone come across any literature that discusses such a methodology?

888,Is mahalanobis-distance matching between points not compatible with one-hot-encoded data-sets?,datascience,t3_9u2gmq,7,False,False,9u2gmq," I am working with a data-set of patient performance-data and patient demographics for people with a medical condition. I am trying to assess the effect of a treatment on the patients, and as I am trying to replicate a randomized experiment from a observational study, I am performing matching between the treatment and control group.

When I try to perform Mahalanobis distance matching, however, I keep getting the following warning on Matlab: ""Warning: Matrix is close to singular or badly scaled. Results may be inaccurate. RCOND = 6.545651e-27.""

The warning was caused because the determinant of my Covariance matrix was very close to 0, so when I calculated the inverse of this matrix (as I need to do for finding the mahalanobis distance), the matrix element values become very close to 0 as well. After reading about this warning a little bit, I found that when this warning is displayed, the results of mahalanobis distance matching isn't very reliable.

I thought this was because my matrix became very sparse after I introduced one-hot-encoding to split the multi-categorical features into many different features, and hence some of my new features were for category values that had very few occurrences (less than 3%). To address this issue, I got rid of the category values with very low occurrences (less than 3%) or binned them together with other low-occurrence category values into slightly larger bins so their chances of occurring increased, and my data-matrix was less sparse.

So, I reduced the number of features from 42 to 33 and I plotted the histograms for all my 33 features to see their distributions and this is what it looked like (note that the element values have been normalized to 0 by subtracting the feature mean and then divided by the feature standard deviation):

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/v377n.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/v377n.png)

It looked visually satisfactory to me, but I still kept getting the same warning in matlab. When I tried finding the determinant of my new covariance matrix, it was still very small (1.6379e-23).

In a further attempt to fix this issue, I checked whether removing all 4 of the categorical features (13 if we consider the one-hot encoded features) made things any better by making the matrix less sparse. The new feature-histogram looked like this:

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5lQz.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5lQz.png)

This time, when I tried Mahalanobis distance matching, the warning was removed because the determinant of the covariance matrix was larger (1.3407e-05).

So I tried to see if I could include one of the removed multi-categorical features without facing the same problem (as these are important features I would prefer to include when doing my matching). I added a categorical feature with 3 possible values and all the values very well distributed (see histogram below)

[https://i.stack.imgur.com/9LdMQ.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9LdMQ.png)

But alas, simply including these 3 new one-hot-encoded features seems to cause the determinant of the covariance matrix to become so small that I start getting the same warning in Matlab.

Is there any fix to this issue? Or is it simply impossible to reliably perform mahalanobis distance matching on this data-set without leaving out the multi-categorical values?"

Obviously I want to create a means of categorizing them using a clustering algorithm. The three clustering algorithms I have selected are K-means, Self Organizing Maps, and Affinity Propagation. 

For K-means and Affinity Propagation both require a similarity matrix. That is how similar are the images, but I do want this to be unsupervised. That is, I can easily bias the results by constructing the similarity matrix myself however I want an algorithm to do this for me. 

I have tried using an algorithm called Mean Square Error. It takes the pixel location of (X,Y) of image X1 and Image Y1, a takes a squared error calculation by subtracting the luminosity value of each pixel and squaring the value. I sum all pixels then get the mean. This is my similarity value between Image X1 and Y1. I do this for each Yn, then for each Xn for each Yn. 

This approach doesn't work for this at all. I am currently using the olivetti faces database to test for Affinity Propagation and the algorithm works for that database, so I know my algorithm for AP works. It must be my method for calculating similarity between images. 

I really have no leads on other ways to calculate similarity between images. The only other way I can think of is the run an image processing for each image in order to find some ""pattern"", then compare the patterns. 

My question is what algorithms exist for a computer to calculate a ""similarity"" between two distinct images. That is for ImageX1 and Image Y2 in my above grid (the first and second image). These are both cars, but different cars and in a different position. Therefore the similarity should be better than say if I were to compare Image X1 and Image Y6 (the image at position 0,0 and the image at position col 0 and row 6). This is a car and a cloud. These should produce a very different similarity value, definitely something less than comparing two cars. 

I realize this might be under computer vision, so I am looking for algorithms that I can plug images into a get a similarity matrix generated.

Dataset: 

id | ts | amount ($)

The dataset is one year's worth of data for transactions. The ID is the retailer. 

\- What are some ways to segment this data? 

So far, I only have transaction amount and number of transactions 

\- How would you identify and predict high growth retailers? (Merchants that will increase their transaction volume in the future). Produce a prediction model

I'm a little stumped on a good way to make this happen. I am used to having more variables to work with on these types of things...

I'm a PhD student (in my third year) considering applying to Data Scientist/Quantitative Analyst positions for a summer internship.

I know you can always just find books on the relevant material and self study, and I'll do that, but I'm just wondering if there's something more focused out there. My background in probability and statistics should be relatively fresh enough, I had to take all that coursework and I still work as a Teaching Assistant for related courses. But I think I'd get a much better sense of where I'm at if I had a straight list of practice problems (i.e., I can look at an intro stats text and know that I remember *most* of it, but I won't really get a sense of what that means until I see what sort of specific questions are common).

I want to build a model that will show me which inputs to my body are the best predictors of the symptoms (in either direction, good or bad). The insights I’m looking for are the top foods or ingredients to avoid and the top medication for improving symptoms. The data can only signal these things from time-series analysis (ex: a symptom tends to occur 1 hour after a food).

914,Best practises for machine learning in AWS? Sagemaker vs EC2 vs EMR. Local vs remote development etc,datascience,t3_9tl7wh,7,False,False,9tl7wh,"We are currently setting up a machine learning / data science team within my company and are considering different architectures / workflows.

Specifically we are considering using Sagemaker but are unsure in what capacity.

1. **Option 1:** We use Sagemaker for our entire Data science workflow: from data analysis to training models to predicting in production? i.e. 5 data scientists using a single notebook instance to write their code. Everything in the cloud - code and data
2. **Option 2:** We analyse &amp; model the data locally and use Sagemaker only when:
   1. The data is too big for local
   2. It is ready for production
3. **Option 3:** We use local notebooks which run Spark (local, or connected to an EC2 cluster in AWS) - using Sagemaker only for the endpoint in production

To some degree I like option 1 as it would mean all of our team's code and data are one place (i.e. AWS), making it easy to collaborate etc.

**However the downsides:**

\- Paying for a Sagemaker notebook 7 hours per day, 5 days per week

\- As all the code in hosted in a notebook, it is vulnerable to being accidentally deleted if the notebook is removed i.e. how could we easily sync this code with Github...?

921,Clustering Methods for Retail Customer Data,datascience,t3_9tg0l9,13,False,False,9tg0l9,"Hello all,

I’m in a new position with a retail company with a few million customers in my market and I want to clean out some general “who are the customers?” insights to share with my stakeholders. 

I’m looking for feedback if there are any pitfalls in my approach I am not accounting for. Summary is below. 

Business Problem
- Customer-focused insights beyond top level metrics have been hard to come by for specific markets. Data is generally looked at globally and my stakeholders want to better understand customers to drive product and marketing decisions for acquisition, growth, and retention. The initial problem is just a lack of understand customer behavior outside of things like which products are purchased most often and google analytics reports. 

Data Availability 
- customer identifiers
- transaction data (some guest some connected to customers)
- product information 

Model Development
- clustering algorithm to find groups of customers based on first purchase information, lifetime information (orders, spend, days since last purchase, % clearance items, number of returns, etc), order variety at a high level (number of different categories and item types),  and overall spend % within high level departments.

I have about 20 variables and a few million customer records. 

I was planning to normalize all my data (it’s all numeric) and then run K-means to find the optimal number of clusters (10-20) and then report on the profile of each cluster and what makes them different from the “average” customer based on the cluster z-score average for a particular variable. E.g. this cluster has high spend but high returns. 

Results Activation
- We have some product affinity stuff in place, but lack understanding at a behavioral standpoint. My goal is to push out high strategic segments of customer types (personas) to focus on and figure out with the stakeholders the next step they want to take for the target segments that pop out. Who are the high value customers and what are their behavioral attributes? How does this differ from low value segments? Who do we grow? Who do we drive deals to? Etc...

I’m planning to validate my clusters with a basic RFM model done ahead of time that will be left out of the modeling. Quartiles of decency, frequency, and spend which will give me segments like VIP customers and list low spenders and ones in between. 

Thoughts? 

Am I missing something? Should I consider something different than k means? Run PCA on the groups of variables I have to reduce the dimensionality? "

925,Distribution theory of Poissen,datascience,t3_9ti549,5,False,False,9ti549,"# Poissen  distribution

If you have good friends, University can also be a good place for you...

I was able to get good results on the distribution of Poissen, With the help of my best friend,**Daniel**

and my good professor, **Dr. Elham Mirfarah**.

I suggest you read about it,Poissen is a very useful distribution in probabilities .

&amp;#x200B;

But what exactly is the Poissen distribution...??

and What was my result ... ??

and What was my code...??

&amp;#x200B;

**Brief description of Poissen distribution**

Many random phenomena are based on counting the number of occurrences of a given incident at a given time or place.

For example, the number of phones that will be routed to a telephone center between 9:00 am and 11:00 am OR  The number of customers who visit banks between 12:00 and 1:00 OR  The number of crashes that occur on a busy crossroads a day.

The probabilities that I said depend on the lambda.(Lambda  is the average number of events per interval)

[That's how they are calculated](https://i.redd.it/z228r786hvv11.png)

**Our result**

if you run my code you can get the output file. (Per your favorite lambda)
